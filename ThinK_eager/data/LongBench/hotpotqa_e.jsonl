The village is the site of the ancient Goguryeo city of Baegam (Hangul :백암성, Hanja :白巖城) in Korea or Baiyan City (Chinese: 白岩城) in Chinese. The ancient city was the scene a major battle between the Tang dynasty Chinese emperor Taizong and the Goguryeo in 645 AD.\n\nHistory\nThe city dates to 403 AD and was built by the Goguryeo people who occupied much of the Liaodong Peninsula, modern Jilin province, Northern Korean Peninsula and part of the Primorsky Krai in modern Russia. Yanzhou was a major city at the frontier between the Goguryeo and Tang dynasty China.\nIn 642 AD, the Goguryeo had a war with the neighbouring land of Silla on the Korean Peninsula. The Silla appealed to the Tang Emperor for assistance and in 645, the Emperor Taizong attacked the Goguryeo. The Tang first captured nearby Liaodong City. Then in June, they attacked at Yanzhou led by Tang Jun and after fierce fighting and some notable heroics by the Emperor and his generals, won.\n\nLocation\nThe city was built on a ridge on the northern side of the Taizi River.  (Chinese: 太子河; pinyin: Tàizǐhé), approximately 20 km east of Liaoyang and 50 km south of Shenyang (Chinese: 沈阳; pinyin: Shěnyáng).\n\nConstruction\nAs with other Goguryeo forts, Yanzhou village was built on a hill adjacent to a river, with the river forming a natural barrier.  Cliffs form the southern side of the city and a high defensive wall formed an arch around the west, north and east sides.  The land slopes such that the eastern side of the city is significantly higher than the west. The site is about 480 metres long and 440 metres wide. The city walls, which are still visible today, cover some 1840 metres in length. The walls were 2 to 3 metres thick and between 5 and 8 metres high with towers at regular intervals along its length, and is comparable to the Great Wall of China in its dimensions. At the top of the ridge are the remains of a square tower with a wall enclosed area to its east. The gate to the city was to the west, near the Taizi River. The construction is of rough-cut stone built dry without mortar.\n\nStatus\nThe city walls in Yanzhou are a protected site of Liaoning province.  Despite its protected status, some of the western sections of the city walls have been dismantled by the adjacent villagers and stones taken from the wall can be seen in various homes and fences throughout the village.  By comparison, the city walls on the northern and eastern sections appear to be in good condition.\n\nAccessibility\nAs of 2014 the site was not developed to encourage tourism and there was no tourist infrastructure present to facilitate tourism related activities within the city walls. Access to the site was neither monitored nor actively controlled.\nThe city can be easily reached by automobile, as paved roads connect it to both Liaoyang and Shenyang.\nPassage 5:\nYanzhou District\nYanzhou (postal: Yenchow; simplified Chinese: 兖州; traditional Chinese: 兗州; pinyin: Yǎnzhōu) is a district in the prefecture-level city of Jining, in the southwest of Shandong province, People's Republic of China. It was also the name of one of the Nine Provinces in ancient China, where Yu combated floods by water control.\n\nAdministration\nYanzhou District administers six subdistricts and six towns:\n\nSubdistricts (街道)\nTowns (镇)\nHistory\nYanzhou was the first place to install the \"school-fields\" xuetian in 1022, during the Song dynasty.In early European sources, based on accounts by French missionaries, the name of Yanzhou (Fu) is transcribed in the contemporary French manner, as Yen-tcheou-fou; however, when reading 18th- and 19th-century books in French or English, care should be taken not to confuse Yanzhou in Shandong with the identically transcribed Yanzhou in Zhejiang.\n\nGeology\nThe land structure of the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the Mount Tai Group. The Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the Neogene stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered limestone, crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"Cultural Revolution\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off. The East Peak had become a deep valley, and the west peak still existed.\n\nClimate\nYanzhou has a monsoon-influenced, four-season humid continental climate (Köppen Dwa). Winters are cold and dry while summers are hot and humid. Monthly daily average temperatures range from −1.0 °C (30.2 °F) in January to 26.8 °C (80.2 °F), while the annual mean temperature is 13.79 °C (56.8 °F).

It is named after Sir Douglas Mawson, a geologist and explorer who made several expeditions to Antarctica. For the first three decades of its existence, it was a bellwether seat held by the party of government. This pattern was broken at the 2002 election, when Robert Brokenshire held the seat for the Liberals amidst a Labor election victory. Although it was thought that Brokenshire had established a base in Mawson, it reverted to form at the 2006 election, when Labor candidate and former journalist Leon Bignell won amid that year's massive Labor landslide. Bignell went on to increase his seat margins at the 2010 and 2014 elections. In both cases, he not only bucked the statewide trend, but also decades of voting patterns in the electorate. The 2016 redistribution ahead of the 2018 election heavily redistributed Mawson from a 5.6 percent Labor seat to a notional 3.2 percent Liberal seat, taking in areas down the coast as far as and including Kangaroo Island.

It contains a mix of seaside residential areas, wasteland and industrial regions. In addition to its namesake suburb of Port Adelaide, the district  includes the suburbs of Birkenhead, Bolivar, Cavan, Dry Creek, Ethelton, Exeter, Garden Island, Gepps Cross, Gillman, Glanville, Globe Derby Park, Largs Bay, Largs North, New Port, North Haven, Osborne, Ottoway, Outer Harbor, Peterhead, Semaphore, Semaphore South, St Kilda, Taperoo, Torrens Island, Wingfield, as well as part of Rosewater.\nPort Adelaide has had three incarnations as a South Australian electoral district.\nPort Adelaide was the name of an electoral district of the unicameral South Australian Legislative Council from 1851 until its abolition in 1857.From 1857 until 1902 it was a two-seat multi-member district. From 1902 until 1915 it was a large three-seat multi-member district covering Adelaide's north-west and western suburbs; together with the four-member Adelaide and five-member Torrens, the three districts with a total of 12-members covered the whole of the metropolitan area in the 42 member house.  The district returned to two members in 1915, and became a single member district from the 1938 election onward. It was held without interruption by Labor until the district's abolition prior to the 1970 election, and for most of that time was one of Labor's safest seats. The bulk of its territory was split between the neighbouring seats of Semaphore and Price.  The last member for this seat's original incarnation, John Ryan, transferred to Price.\nThe seat was recreated in 2002, essentially as a reconfigured version of Hart (which was itself created in 1993 as a replacement for Semaphore). Like its previous incarnation, it is a comfortably safe Labor seat.  The member for Hart, deputy premier and state treasurer Kevin Foley, followed most of his constituents into the recreated seat and held it easily.  At the 2006 election, Foley increased his margin from 21.7 percent to 25.7 percent, and gained a majority in all booths. Foley retired in 2011, triggering a by-election held in February 2012.  Susan Close retained the seat for Labor.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nMcLaren Vale\nMcLaren Vale is a  wine region in the Australian state of South Australia located in the  Adelaide metropolitan area and centred on the town of McLaren Vale  about 38 kilometres (24 mi) south of the Adelaide city centre. It is internationally renowned for the wines it produces and is included within the Great Wine Capitals of the World. The region was named after either David McLaren, the Colonial Manager of the South Australia Company or John McLaren (unrelated) who surveyed the area in 1839. Among the first settlers to the region in late 1839, were two English farmers from Devon, William Colton and Charles Thomas Hewett. William Colton established the Daringa Farm and Charles Thomas Hewett established Oxenberry Farm. Both men would be prominent in the early days of McLaren Vale. Although initially the region's main economic activity was the growing of cereal crops, John Reynell and Thomas Hardy planted grape vines in 1838 and the present-day Seaview and Hardy wineries were in operation as early as 1850. Grapes were first planted in the region in 1838 and some vines more than 100 years old are still producing. Today there are more than 95 cellar doors in McLaren Vale. The majority are family-run operations and boutique wineries.\n\nGeography\nThe wine region, which is located within the southern end of the Adelaide metropolitan area, runs 30km down the coastline of the Gulf St Vincent in the west and stretches to the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges in the east. Its northern boundary commences at the coastline in the suburb of Hallett Cove and finishes in the foothills in the suburb of Chandlers Hill. It is located mainly within the local government area of the City of Onkaparinga with part of its northern end being in the local government area of the City of Marion.\n\nClimate\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has a Mediterranean climate with four clear seasons. With a dry and warm summer, the area typically has dry weather from December through to March or April, giving an easy change between summer and winter. The climate  is gentle with long, warm days and short, cool nights. Winter rains of 580–700 mm per annum flow into a fresh spring. It rarely experiences frost or drought due to its close proximity to the sea.\n\nWines\nThe McLaren Vale wine region is well known for its dry red wines, especially those made from Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. A range of climate appropriate Mediterranean grape varieties including Mourvedre, Tempranillo, Nero d'Avola and Sangiovese are increasingly being grown. White wine varieties in the wine region include Fiano, Vermentino, Grenache blanc, Roussanne and other such Mediterranean varieties.\nNotable for producing premium Shiraz, the grape is by far the most important variety for the wine region, accounting for about 60% of the total crush. The area's diverse soils, limited water and warm summers harness Shiraz's natural vigor and produce intense flavored fruit, and wine with a deep purple color that can last decades in the bottle. McLaren Vale region has 3218 hectares of Shiraz under vine. Other major varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon with 1288 ha planted, Chardonnay with 722 ha planted, and Grenache with 402 ha—much of this dry-grown (non-irrigated) bush vines. (Statistics taken from the Phylloxera and Grape Industry Board's vineyard register as of May 2005.)\n\nShiraz is harvested from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is renowned for its great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers within the wine region choose to blend their final Shiraz from a variety of sub-regions to add complexity.  The wine region naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. Grape pulp contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine. The wine region has a diversity of soil types, clones and winemaking philosophies, which has led to a huge range of Shiraz wine styles being produced. Most winemakers produce at least one Shiraz wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is harvested in late March. Less famous than McLaren Vale Shiraz, but equally enchanting, Cabernet Sauvignon from the wine region continues to display the rich ripe characters that typify wines from this region. Violet and blackcurrant flavours, vibrant plum, mint and edges of liquorice and a touch of the wine regions trademark dark chocolate character are common.\nGrenache is harvested in late April. It is the ancient type of vine widely planted in France and Spain. It is the backbone of many of the world's red and fortified wines. Grenache vines were removed from the wine region in the 1980s when demand for fortified wines fell. Since the late 1990s Grenache has been enjoying a resurgence of popularity as table wine. The wine region's soils are particularly suited to this variety. However, in wet years it can be difficult to grow well as it can produce big bunches of grapes which make a less concentrated wine. In the best vintages Grenache displays nuances of plum, mulberry and tobacco leaf, spice and mint characters with earthy overtones.\nChardonnay is harvested in mid March. This is the major white variety in the wine region. The most pronounced and distinctive feature is ripe peaches, with the wine from cooler sites displaying white peach. These wines maintain elegance and generally have long cellaring potential. Some McLaren Vale Chardonnay also features ripe melon, banana, fig and cashew nut flavours—rich and generous with pure elegance.\nSauvignon blanc is harvested in early March. Sauvignon blanc from McLaren Vale has distinctive varietal characters of tropical fruit, green olives and asparagus, and a full-flavored palate with a clean, fresh acid finish. Sauvignon blanc grown in the wine region reaches relatively high sugar levels compared with other wine regions growing this variety. The variety shows herbaceous, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee aromas.\nPetit Verdot is one of Bordeaux's classic red grape varieties. It is a very thick-skinned grape that produces a wine of considerable depth, peppery, spicy and fragrant. Geoff Johnston of Pirramimma planted the first Australian plot at McLaren Vale in 1983 and it is only now that this wine is being recognized elsewhere. Demand for cuttings of this variety has expanded rapidly and more wines will be presented to the market in the future. Petit Verdot grapes produce wine that has the color intensity and spice of Shiraz, but with added fragrance of violets, which makes the nose very attractive.\nSangiovese is an Italian variety that does well in low fertility soils and a warm dry climate. It is slow to ripen and produces wine high in acid and tannin. The wine is deep in colour and aroma, and good for long cellaring. Sangiovese is harvested in the wine region from late March to early April.\nTempranillo is a Spanish variety that produces a red wine that matures quickly and can be ready for drinking in the year of vintage. In Spain Tempranillo is one of the most popular reds and when blended with Carignan it makes the best red wine of the Rioja region.\nVerdelho is a Portuguese white wine variety that likes low vigour soils and a warm dry climate, Verdelho has been around for some time and is enjoying an increase in popularity. It produces wines that are vivacious, fruit salad-like, dry, and best when drunk young and fresh.\nViognier is an exotic variety introduced from France where the best wines are produced in the Condrieu region. This variety exhibits exotic aromas of apricot and musk, and light oak and malolactic character; with rose, nectarine and white peach, McLaren Vale Viognier is spicy and complex with a huge spectrum of flavours.\nZinfandel is a thin-skinned grape that needs dry conditions to avoid rotting. Bunches ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.\n\nSoil characteristics\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has many different soil types, and this contributes to the wines from the area having different terroir. The vineyards are planted on soils including fertile red-brown earths, terra rossa, rendzina, soft sands and dark cracking clays.\nEach of these soil types contributes to the rich diversity of wine produced by the winemakers of the wine region. Overall the soils have one common trait; they are free draining which means they hold very little water. This is, in fact, an advantage, as it allows the accurate control of moisture to the vines through the use of state-of-the-art drip irrigation. Because of reliable winter rain, irrigation can be kept to low levels and manipulated to achieve the production of superior fruit.\nSome soil types allow grapes to be dry-grown. Approximately 20% of the total crop is dry-grown. These dry-grown vines are renowned for small fruit size, which is sought after for the intensity of its flavour.\nMost vineyards are found on gently undulating land at about 100m above sea level. In the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east, where there is a scattering of vineyards, elevation rises to 320 m. At Blewitt Springs elevation is around 200 m. These variations in elevation have a significant impact on the terroir and fruit produced in the vineyards.\n\nSubregions\nThe McLaren Vale wine region has no recognised subregions, however, some wineries promote their vineyards as being in particular subregions with terroir peculiar to that part of the region. The McLaren Vale Grape Wine and Tourism Association has identified 19 distinct districts based on climate and geology.\n\nStatutory protection of parts of the wine region\nIn February 2011, South Australian Premier Mike Rann announced that the state government would \"look at ways that we can protect the unique identity and integrity of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale.\"  Premier Rann said: \"Barossa and McLaren Vale food and wine are key icons of South Australia. We must never allow the Barossa or McLaren Vale to become suburbs of Adelaide (sic).\"Legislation to protect the character of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale was reported in the media as being passed by the South Australian Parliament in 2012 and came into force in January 2013.  The statutory change consisted of an amendment to an existing item of legislation, the Development Act 1993, to create protection districts (also called Character Preservation Districts) within the relevant local government areas to replace the interim protection districts put in place on 11 April 2012.  The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the requirements for a protection district will always prevail over other development requirements where there is conflict.In the case of the McLaren Vale wine region, a character protection district with the name McLaren Vale District was created within the boundaries of the City of Onkaparinga.  The character protection district overlays a majority of the land within the local government area.  Specifically, this is land not zoned for residential and other urban uses and consists mainly of the eastern side of the local government area extending from the Sturt Creek in the north to parts of the coastal suburbs of Aldinga, Aldinga Beach, Maslin Beach, Port Willunga and Sellicks Beach in the south.\n\nSee also\nAustralian wine\nFleurieu zone (wine)\nList of wineries in McLaren Vale\nSouth Australian wine\nPassage 8:\nCradock, South Australia\nCradock is a town and locality in the Australian state of South Australia 320 kilometres north of the state capital of Adelaide on the RM Williams Way  . The nearest town with a greater population is Hawker which is approximately 20 km away with a population of around 360. Cradock is in the Flinders Ranges Council area, the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nThe town was surveyed during November 1878 and proclaimed on 6 March 1879.  The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 25 November 1999 and include the Government Town of Cradock and the sites of the ceased Government Towns of Charlcome and Herbert.After the South Australian government permitted settlers to go into the semi-arid lands north of Goyder's Line Cradock was established in 1879 on a 'grassy flat' of 'strong red loam', by the Wirreanda Creek. Cradock takes its name from the then Governor of South Africa, Sir John Cradock.Soon after settlement, a school, police station, two hotels, two blacksmith shops and a saddler were operating in Cradock. The \"wheat rush\" was followed by the failure of four years of crops which led to an increasing despair and a loss of many of the town's population.\n\nHistoric buildings\nCradock had three churches. The stone Catholic church opened in 1883. The Wesleyan Methodist church built in 1884 was weatherboard and iron, replaced by a stone church (construction started in 1924) which was used into the 1980s, but is now a private residence. The stone Anglican church built in 1894 was used until 1958 and is also now a private residence.The historic former St Gabriel's Catholic Church designed by Thomas Burgoyne in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.The town still has one hotel, the Cradock Hotel, known in earlier days as the Heartbreak Hotel.\nPassage 9:\nPenor, Pahang\nPenor is a small town in Kuantan District, Pahang, Malaysia. Located near the Kuantan-Pekan district border, it is accessible by the  Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route 183). Penor houses the jail of Pahang, Penor Jail, which is Penor's landmark.

{"input": "Are both Dictyosperma, and Huernia described as a genus?", "context": "Passage 1:\nHuernia\nThe genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of perennial, stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa and Arabia, first described as a genus in 1810.The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown. To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.The name of the plant is in honor of Justus van Heurne (1587–1653?) a Dutch missionary, botanist, and doctor, who is reputed to have been the first European to document and collect South African Cape plants. His surname has variations (van Horne, Heurnius, van Heurnius), however it was misspelled by the plant collector.Various species of Huernia are considered famine food by the inhabitants of Konso special woreda in southern Ethiopia. The local inhabitants, who call the native species of this genus baqibaqa indiscriminately, eat it with prepared balls of sorghum (kurkufa); they note that baqibaqa tastes relatively good and has no unpleasant side-effects when boiled and consumed. As a result, local farmers encouraged it to grow on stone walls forming the terraces, where it does not compete with other crops.\n\nSpecies\nThe follow species of Huernia are found in Africa (East Africa, South Africa and Ethiopia) and Arabia (Saudi Arabia, Yemen).\nformerly includedmoved to Angolluma\n\nHuernia sprengeri now Angolluma sprengeri\nPassage 2:\nDictyosperma\nDictyosperma is a monotypic genus of flowering plant in the palm family found in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat. It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves. It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix. The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.\n\nDescription\nThe ringed trunks are solitary at 15 cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax— which has given the palm its epithet album— and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30 cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 – 90 cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane.\nOn flowering, they produce up to six inflorescences which ring the trunk below the crownshaft, branched to one order, with white to yellow flowers, which are male and female; both pistillate and staminate flowers have three sepals and three petals, the former being smaller than the latter. The ovoid fruit ripen to purple or black in color, containing one brown, ellipsoidal seed.\nThree varieties are currently recognized:\n\nDictyosperma album var. album (Bory) Scheff. - Mauritius, Réunion\nDictyosperma album var. aureum Balf.f. in J.G.Baker - Rodrigues Island\nDictyosperma album var. conjugatum H.E.Moore & J.Guého - 2 remaining specimens on Île Ronde of Mauritius (Characterised by shorter trunk and white leaf-scar)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nLiving in the coastal forests of the Mascarenes, they experience warm temperatures, high humidity and regular rainfall.\n\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae\nAsterolecanium dictyospermae is a species of sap sucking scale insect found only on Île Ronde on the two remaining Dictyosperma album var. conjugatum specimens. It apparently evolved on Île Ronde and became restricted to feeding upon the island's endemic variety, and due to interbreeding (between varieties) on Mauritius itself which jeopardized reproductive potential, the scale insect increased in population as a result of stress upon the host, which then threatens the existence of both host and scale insect.", "answers": ["yes"], "length": 734, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ebbd87b5c458cf749032bb57bb69ba30cd54ac841b39153d"}

{"input": "Willsmere was a railway station located in which inner suburb from Melbourne Australia?", "context": "Passage 1:\nKew, Victoria\nKew (;) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km east from Melbourne's Central Business District, located within the City of Boroondara local government area. Kew recorded a population of 24,499 at the 2021 census.A city in its own right from 1860 to 1994, Kew was amalgamated with the cities of Hawthorn and Camberwell to form the City of Boroondara. The suburb borders the Yarra River to the west and northwest, with Kew East to the northeast, Hawthorn and Hawthorn East to its south, and with Balwyn, Balwyn North and Deepdene to the east.\n\nHistory\nPrior to the establishment of Melbourne, the area was inhabited by the Wurundjeri peoples. In the 1840s European settlers named it the Parish of Boroondara – meaning \"a place of shade\" in the Woiwurrung language. In 1838 Dight travelled down the Yarra from Heidelberg and decided to locate a water-powered mill on a site adjacent to Dights Falls; the impressive three-storey mill opened in 1840.John Hodgson established a squatters run at Studley Park, on the eastern bank of the Yarra River, in 1840. Studley House, also known as Burke Hall, built in 1857, was named after Hodgson's birthplace of Studley, Yorkshire and the house is now on the Register of the National Estate. The house was built in the Victorian Period Italianate Revival style. Modifications were made to the house in 1875 and 1919. The house was also owned by former bookmaker, ALP lobbyist, influential Irish-Catholic and millionaire, John Wren and was donated to Xavier College by the land developer, Thomas Burke. It illustrates the importance of a residence in indicating success and status in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Melbourne society. The nearby Villa Alba, built before 1863, is open to the public.In 1851, Crown land sales occurred in the area. One of the purchasers, Nicholas Fenwick, subdivided his land (which was just further out from the centre of the colony of Melbourne than the area known as Richmond) and named the region Kew, based on the thought that Kew in England was near Richmond. He also notably named its streets after British statesmen. The area quickly became a sought-after suburb for the well-to-do in Melbourne. Access to Kew was originally via Bridge Road in Richmond, crossing the Hawthorn Bridge to Burwood Road, until the privately owned Studley Park Bridge (nicknamed the Penny Bridge) opened in 1857, connecting Church Street Richmond with Studley Park.\nThe commercial precinct known as Kew Junction began to take shape in the 1850s. The first store was opened by Mr. J. J. French in August 1853 and the first post office on 6 October 1856, however, it was not till towards the end of the decade that many shops appeared in High Street. The Kew Hotel opened in 1855, the Prospect Hill Hotel (now the Dan Murphy's liquor store) in 1857, the Council Hotel about 1860, the Clifton (now Hotel Kew) in 1869 and the Greyhound (now the Skinny Dog Hotel) in 1874. The block of civic buildings comprising the former post office, the former court house and the former police station were built in 1888 as was the National Bank, at the corner of Walpole and High Streets.In 1856, a site was reserved for a mental asylum next to the river. By 1871 Kew Lunatic Asylum, now known as Willsmere Estate, was completed. The Kew Cottages for children were added in 1887. The hospital was built despite objections by residents and the Kew Borough Council and provides an historical example of nimbyism. Kew Cottages and Willsmere Hospital are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\nVarious churches opened in the 1850s, with the first school opened by the Anglican Church in 1856. In 1875 Sacred Heart Primary School was opened. More private schools were opened in 1878, including Ruyton Girls' School (non-denominational) and Xavier College (Catholic in Jesuit order). Other private schools soon followed, including Methodist Ladies' College (Uniting Church in Australia) in 1882, Genazzano FCJ College in 1889, Trinity Grammar School (Anglican) in 1903, and Carey Baptist Grammar School (Baptist) in 1923. Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School, was opened in the early 1930s. In 1960 it was said: \"it would be difficult to find any locality so richly endowed with so many and such large educational institutions as are to be found in Kew.\"A railway branch line to Kew from Hawthorn Station opened on 19 December 1887 and was officially closed on 13 May 1957. Kew was proclaimed a town on 8 December 1910, and a city on 10 March 1921. The population of the area tripled between 1910 and World War II.\nA former house in Kew was the birthplace of the 21st Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. As of 2016, due to its demolition, the house no longer exists.\n\nRaheen\nRaheen is a historic 19th-century Italianate mansion, located at 92 Studley Park Road. It was built in the 1870s, and its name means \"little fort\" in Irish.\nRaheen was once the residence of Daniel Mannix, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and was purchased by the Catholic Church in 1917 with support from John Wren.\nIt was purchased in 1980 by the Australian businessman Richard Pratt and his family and is not currently open to the public. Pratt extensively renovated the house and gardens, including the addition of a new wing, designed by Glen Murcutt.\n\nToday\nKew has grown steadily since the early Bridge Road crossing development and is cited as one of the most prestigious suburbs in Melbourne. As a consequence, many of these residences now attract some of the highest residential resale values in Melbourne.Streets in the Sackville Ward (bounded by Barkers, Burke, Cotham and Glenferrie Roads), such as Alfred, Rowland, Wellington, Grange and Sackville, have some exceptional examples of Edwardian, Victorian and contemporary architecture.\nThe suburb has been home to numerous Scout Groups since 1st Kew was formed in 1909. Today, only 1st Kew and 4th Kew are in operation.\nKew has convenient access to public facilities and transport. The 109, 16 and 72 along with tram route 48 (North Balwyn – Victoria Harbour Docklands) tram routes pass through the suburb and the City/Lilydale/Belgrave train line is easily accessed at Hawthorn and Glenferrie Stations. Kew Station and the associated railway branch was last served by passenger trains in 1952, with the station site now the headquarters of VicRoads.\n\nDemographics\nIn the 2021 Census, there were 24,499 people in Kew. 66.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 6.6%, England 2.9%, Malaysia 2.2%, India 1.8% and New Zealand 1.4%. 70.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.6%, Greek 3.0%, Cantonese 2.8%, Italian 1.7% and Vietnamese 1.4%.

{"input": "The third solo album by David Gates of Bread shares a name with a 1977 film directed by who?", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe Goodbye Girl\nThe Goodbye Girl is a 1977 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Herbert Ross, written by Neil Simon and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Quinn Cummings and Paul Benedict. The film, produced by Ray Stark, centers on an odd trio of characters: a struggling actor who has sublet a Manhattan apartment from a friend, the current occupant (his friend's ex-girlfriend, who has just been abandoned), and her precocious young daughter.\nRichard Dreyfuss won the 1977 Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Elliot Garfield. At the time, he became the youngest man (at age 30) to win an Oscar for Best Actor. Both Mason and Cummings were nominated for Oscars.\nThe film became the first romantic comedy to earn $100 million in box-office grosses.\n\nPlot\nDancer and divorcee Paula McFadden (Marsha Mason) and her ten-year-old daughter Lucy (Quinn Cummings) live in a Manhattan apartment with her married boyfriend, Tony DeForrest. Coming home from shopping, Paula finds Tony gone as he had suddenly deserted her to travel to Italy for a film role. Prior to his departure (and unbeknownst to Paula), Tony sublet the apartment to Elliot Garfield (Richard Dreyfuss), a neurotic but sweet aspiring actor from Chicago, who shows up in the middle of the night expecting to move in. Paula, who is demanding, cynical, and neurotic, makes it clear from the start that she does not like Elliot, but reluctantly lets him move in. They argue about boundaries, with Elliot agreeing to allow Paula and Lucy to stay.\nPaula is struggling to get back into shape so she can resume her career as a dancer. Meanwhile, Elliot has landed the title role in an off-off-Broadway production of Richard III, but the director, Mark (Paul Benedict), wants him to play Richard III of England as an exaggerated homosexual stereotype—in Mark's words, \"the queen who wanted to be king.\" Reluctantly, Elliot agrees to the non-traditional portrayal, despite knowing that it may mean the end of his acting career. Theater critics from numerous New York City television stations and newspapers attend opening night and savage the show, paying special attention to trashing Elliot's performance. The play quickly closes, much to his relief.\nDespite their frequent clashes and Paula's lack of gratitude for Elliot's help, the two fall in love and sleep together. Lucy, despite liking Elliot, grows cautious and sees the affair as a repeat of what happened with Tony. Elliot convinces Paula that he will not be a repeat of their experience with Tony; later he picks up Lucy from school and takes her on a carriage ride, during which the youngster admits she likes Elliot. In response, Elliot explains how much he cares for Lucy and Paula and that he would not do anything to hurt them.\nElliot lands a job at an improvisational theatre, and is soon seen by a well-known film director. He is offered an opportunity for a film role that he cannot turn down, but the job is in Seattle and Elliot will be gone for four weeks. Paula is scared that Elliot is leaving her, never to return, like all the other men in her life. Later, Elliot calls Paula from the phone booth across the street to say his flight was delayed, and at the last minute, he invites Paula to go with him while he is filming, suggesting Lucy stay with Paula's friend Donna until they return. Paula declines but is encouraged by Elliot's invitation. Before hanging up, Elliot asks Paula to restring his prized guitar (which he deliberately left at the apartment), and she realizes this proves he really does love her and will indeed return.\n\nCast\nRichard Dreyfuss as Elliot Garfield\nMarsha Mason as Paula McFadden\nQuinn Cummings as Lucy McFadden\nPaul Benedict as Mark Bodine\nBarbara Rhoades as Donna Douglas\nTheresa Merritt as Mrs. Crosby\nMichael Shawn as Ronnie Burns\nPatricia Pearcy as Rhonda Fontana\nNicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began as a screenplay called Bogart Slept Here (essentially the story of what happened to Dustin Hoffman after he became a star) that was to star Robert De Niro and Mason for Warner Bros. It would have been the film De Niro made immediately after Taxi Driver. Mike Nichols was hired to direct.Simon recalled the original idea for the film:\n\nThe basic idea of the story was that Marsha, an ex-dancer, was married to a very promising but struggling off-Broadway actor who gets discovered in a small play and is whisked out to Hollywood, where he reluctantly moves with his family. He feels very out of place there...and they have trouble adjusting, especially after his first film makes him an international star...and it creates chaos in their marriage. The story was coming out a little darker than I had imagined, but I envisioned the character of the wife as a very good role for Marsha.\nFilming began on Bogart Slept Here but it became apparent that De Niro was not right for the role. Simon recalled: \"...it was clear that any of the humor I had written was going to get lost. It's not that De Niro is not funny, but his humor comes mostly from his nuances, a bemused expression on his face or the way he would look at a character, smile and then look up at the ceiling.\" Nichols insisted on recasting De Niro. Soon after, Nichols left the project.Dreyfuss was brought in to audition with Mason. At the end of the reading, Simon decided the chemistry was there, but the script needed work. He rewrote the screenplay in six weeks.\n\n[The screenplay] had to be funnier, more romantic, the way Marsha and I first imagined the picture would be. What I wanted to do was a prequel. In other words, instead of an off-Broadway actor, married with a child, why don't I start from the beginning? I'd start when they first meet. Not liking each other at first and then falling in love.\nThe film's exteriors were filmed in New York City and the interiors were shot on sets in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. was less than enthused about Simon's script and considered selling the project to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but the studio ultimately decided to partner with MGM on the film instead. With the 1996 acquisition of Turner Entertainment Company, which owned the pre-May 1986 MGM film library by Time Warner, Warner Bros. now owns the rights and distribution of the film.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe title song, \"Goodbye Girl\", was written and performed by David Gates in 1977, and was a top 20 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1977/78, peaking at #15.\n\nReception\nRoger Ebert gave the film a mostly favorable review, awarding three stars out of four. He was unimpressed with Mason's performance and the character as written, calling it \"hardly ever sympathetic.\" However, he praised Dreyfuss and cited his Richard III scenes as \"the funniest in a movie since Mel Brooks staged Springtime for Hitler.\" Ebert criticized the beginning as \"awkward at times and never quite involving,\" but \"enjoyed its conclusion so much that we almost forgot our earlier reservations.\" Gene Siskel awarded an identical three-star grade and said, \"Make no mistake about it, the very best thing about 'The Goodbye Girl' is the character of Elliot Garfield as played by Dreyfuss, a character that comes very close to Dreyfuss' own self-and-profession centered lifestyle. But like Dreyfuss himself, Elliott Garfield, who initially comes off as [a] pushy, prickly type, ultimately wins you over.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times found the film to be \"exhausting without being much fun\" and \"relentlessly wisecracked.\" Charles Champlin of The Los Angeles Times lauded it as \"the best and most blissfully satisfying romantic comedy of the year and then some.\" Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"another feather in Herbert Ross' directorial cap,\" with Dreyfuss giving \"his best screen performance to date.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"evolves into the most satisfying comedy Simon has written directly for the movies. One tolerates the plot mechanics for the sake of the genuinely amusing aspects of his script, the bright remarks and the distinctive or appealing character traits that provide good performers with live ammunition.\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was negative, commenting, \"It's not Neil Simon's one-liners that get you down in The Goodbye Girl, it's his two-liners. The snappiness of the exchanges is so forced it's almost macabre.\" David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, \"It's pure formula, and Simon plays it straight, all cards on the table, with the conservative professionalism of a gambler used to winning. As directed by the ubiquitous Herbert Ross, The Goodbye Girl is a modest, bittersweet comedy that will delight Simon fans and leave his critics staunchly unconverted.\"On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 80% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10.\n\nAwards and nominations\nRichard Dreyfuss was 30 when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the youngest actor ever to win the category. This record stood for 25 years until 2002 when Adrien Brody—just one month shy of his 30th birthday—won for The Pianist.\nAmerican Film Institute\n\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs – Nominated\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Passions – #81\nAFI's 100 Years...100 Songs:\nThe Goodbye Girl – Nominated\nAFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Romantic Comedy\n\nMusical and remake\nThere were three failed attempts to turn The Goodbye Girl into a half-hour, television sitcom, according to Lee Goldberg's book Unsold Television Pilots.

It runs from the Virginia state line, where the roadway continues east to Appalachia, Virginia as State Route 160, north via Lynch, Benham, Clutts, Cumberland, Sand Hill, Gordon, Linefork, Kings Creek, Premium, and Hot Spot to Kentucky Route 15 at Van. KY 160 overlaps KY 15 through Isom to Cody, where it splits to run via Carr Creek, Brinkley, and Hindman, ending at Kentucky Route 1087 at Vest. Due to the mountainous terrain and numerous tight bends. KY 160 is signposted closed to tractor-trailers from Lynch to the Virginia state line. \n\nKY 160 is part of the State Primary System from Virginia to the U.S. Highway 119 interchange in Cumberland, the State Secondary System from US 119 to KY 15 at Van and from KY 15 at Cody to Kentucky Route 80 north of Hindman, and the Rural Secondary System from KY 80 to KY 1087 at Vest.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 2:\nKentucky Route 686\nKentucky Route 686 (KY 686) is a 6.333-mile (10.192 km) state highway around the city of Mount Sterling, Kentucky. The route begins at Kentucky Route 11 and U.S. Route 460 north of the city and goes counter-clockwise, ending at U.S. Route 60 east of downtown. The western portion of the bypass from KY 11 south of the city to US 460 north of the city was completed in late 1985 as a four-lane highway. East of the southern junction with US 460 to the eastern terminus at US 60, KY 686 is a 2.827-mile (4.550 km) two-lane highway on a four-lane right-of-way and was completed in the early 2000s.\n\nRoute description\nKY 686 begins at an intersection with US 460/KY 11 in the northern part of Mount Sterling, heading west on four-lane divided Indian Mound Drive. The road passes through business areas, curving to the south. The route intersects KY 713 before coming to a junction with US 60. Past US 60, KY 686 heads through residential areas with some businesses, turning to the east. The road intersects KY 11 again and passes more development in the southern part of Mount Sterling before coming to another junction with US 460. Following this intersection, the route heads northeast into agricultural areas and narrows into a two-lane undivided road, crossing KY 713 again. KY 686 curves to the north and passes through more rural areas before heading near residential and commercial development and ending at another intersection with US 60 to the east of Mount Sterling.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Montgomery County.\nPassage 3:\nOldham County, Kentucky\nOldham County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state and commonwealth of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 67,607. Its county seat is La Grange. The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.\nOldham County is part of the Louisville/Jefferson County, KY–IN Metropolitan Statistical Area.\nOldham County is the wealthiest county in Kentucky and 47th-wealthiest county in the U.S. and ranks as the most educated county in Kentucky  While the causes for this are complicated, areas east of Louisville have long been popular with wealthy residents, initially as summer residences and eventually as year-round suburban estates and bedroom communities. Oldham County lies northeast of the best known of these areas, Anchorage, just outside Louisville's pre-merger East End.\n\nHistory\nOldham County was established on December 15, 1823, from parts of Henry, Jefferson, and Shelby Counties. It was the 74th Kentucky county, and was named in honor of Col. William Oldham of Jefferson County, a Revolutionary War officer.Initially, it was mainly a rural county with small, scattered developments in places like Westport which was founded in 1800 and served as the county seat early on. When the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad Company introduced rail lines in the area in the 1850s, many new towns and communities sprang up. Eventually the railroad ceased operating as a form of public transportation, but the more rural nature of the county continued to draw residents away from the metropolitan areas in Jefferson County. Since the early 1970s and the completion of Interstate 71, which connects Oldham County to Downtown Louisville and shopping in Eastern Jefferson County, Oldham County has increasingly become suburban in nature, a natural extension of Louisville's wealthy East End as it ran out of large tracts of undeveloped land.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 196 square miles (510 km2), of which 187 square miles (480 km2) are land and 9.2 square miles (24 km2) (4.7%) are covered by water. It is the 13th-smallest county in Kentucky.

Oldham County is the most affluent county in the state of Kentucky; most residents work in Louisville and choose to live in Oldham County due to the lack of crime and the nationally recognized school system. North Oldham High School in particular, is ranked very highly among state high schools, having been named a national blue ribbon school of excellence, and ranked in the top 250 best schools in the nation through US Weekly. 2006 classes at Oldham County High School were reported as to have a teacher:student ratio of 1:15, but that number does not accurately reflect the ratio of a normal class.  That number includes, for example, the small classes of five to six students in Behavioral Disorders.  The published ratio also includes small classes at the County Career Center, which is located on the same campus.  The actual teacher-student ratios are closer to 1:30. Regardless of population swelling and diminishing student-teacher ratios, which have led to a slight decline as of late, Oldham county is still widely recognized as the best public school system in the state.\n\nCommunities\nCities\nCensus-designated places\nBuckner\nWestport\n\nOther unincorporated places\nPolitics\nGovernment\nAt the federal level, Oldham County overlaps two congressional districts in the House of Representatives, the third district, represented by Democrat John Yarmuth, and the fourth district, represented by Republican Thomas Massie.\n\nNotable people\nD.

The highway, maintained by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, runs north from High Bridge, Kentucky through Wilmore before ending at Nicholasville. Within Wilmore, KY 29 intersects Kentucky Route 1268 and junctions with Kentucky Route 3433. The highway acts as the border between Asbury University and Asbury Theological Seminary. Just north of Wilmore, KY 29 merges with U.S. Route 68 for 0.590 miles (0.950 km) before leaving US 68 and turning east heading towards Nicholasville. KY 29 terminates at Kentucky Route 39 and U.S. Route 27 Business in downtown Nicholasville.\n\nRoute description\nKY 29 begins at an intersection with Lock Seven Road near the Kentucky River in High Bridge, Jessamine County, heading north on two-lane undivided High Bridge Road. The road heads through woodland with some homes and turns to the east, passing under a Norfolk Southern railroad line. The route continues through farmland with some woods and residences and curves to the northeast. KY 29 turns to the north and comes to a bridge over the railroad tracks. The road heads northeast through more rural areas before it enters Wilmore and becomes South Lexington Avenue. KY 29 passes homes before it runs past businesses and comes to an intersection with KY 1268. The road becomes North Lexington Avenue and runs between Asbury University to the west and Asbury Theological Seminary to the east. The route intersects the western terminus of KY 3433 and continues through residential areas. KY 29 leaves Wilmore and becomes Lexington Road, passing through farmland with some residential development. The route comes to an intersection with US 68 and forms a concurrency with that route on Harrodsburg Road.The road heads northeast and widens into a four-lane divided highway. KY 29 splits from US 68 by heading southeast on two-lane undivided Wilmore Road and continues through agricultural areas with some residential development. The road curves to the east and intersects the eastern terminus of KY 3433. The route heads into Nicholasville and widens to a divided highway as it comes to an interchange with US 27. KY 29 becomes undivided again and passes through residential and commercial areas, coming to another bridge over the Norfolk Southern line. The road becomes West Maple Street and runs past more homes before intersecting the southern terminus of KY 2332 and heading into the downtown area. KY 29 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 27 Bus., where the road continues east as KY 39.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Jessamine County.\nPassage 5:\nKentucky Route 3016\nKentucky Route 3016 (KY 3016) is a state highway in the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. The highway extends 2.082 miles (3.351 km) from KY 982 north to KY 36 and KY 356 in Cynthiana in central Harrison County. KY 3016 serves the south and west sides of the Harrison County seat. The highway was established north of U.S. Route 27 Business (US 27 Bus.) and KY 32 in 1987 and extended south to KY 982 in 2014.\n\nRoute description\nKY 3016 begins at KY 982 (New Lair Road) just north of that highway's bridge across the South Fork Licking River at the south city limit of Cynthiana. The highway heads northwest along Safety Way and veers onto Ladish Road just east of its bridge across the South Fork Licking River. West of the river, KY 3016 turns northeast onto Paris Pike, on which the highway runs concurrently with US 27 Bus. and KY 32. The route splits onto Old Leesburg Pike, which crosses and then parallels Grays Run and Paris Pike, which runs along the south side of Grays Run on its way to its river crossing and downtown Cynthiana. At Grays Run's confluence with the South Fork Licking River, KY 3016 curves north onto River Road, which the route follows to its northern terminus at a five-way intersection with KY 36, KY 356, and White Oak Pike. KY 36 heads east along Pleasant Street into downtown Cynthiana and north on Williamstown Road, and KY 356 heads west on Pleasant Street. The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet classifies KY 3016 as a state secondary highway along its independent course; its concurrency with US 27 Bus. and KY 32 is a state primary highway.\n\nHistory\nThe Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 3016 as a rural secondary highway between Paris Pike, which then included mainline US 27, and Pleasant Street through a May 4, 1987, official order. The agency reclassified the highway as a state secondary highway via an October 19, 2004, official order. The cabinet extended KY 3016 south from US 27 along Ladish Road and Safety Way to KY 982 after an August 5, 2014, official order. The highway's overlap with US 27 became one with US 27 Business after the mainline U.S. Highway was placed on the Cynthiana Bypass as ordered December 10, 2014.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Cynthiana, Harrison County.\nPassage 6:\nKentucky Route 393\nKentucky Route 393 (KY 393) is a 5.325-mile-long (8.570 km) state highway in Oldham County, Kentucky, that runs from Kentucky Route 1818 southeast of Centerfield to U.S. Route 42 north of Buckner.\n\nRoute description\nIts northern terminus is US 42.  From there it continues 5.5 miles (8.9 km) south to a 0.04-mile (0.064 km) overlap with KY 146 in Buckner.  It then splits south to continue for 2.5 miles (4.0 km) where it junctions KY 22 near Centerfield.  It follows KY 22 east for 1-mile (1.6 km) until it splits to the south.  It continues 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south and then terminates at Mount Zion Road.  There are no low clearances or weight limits on this particular state route. As of 2009, this route has been relocated and improved.  From the interchange of Interstate 71, it has been widened to three lanes with a center turn lane.  It has been improved to the junction of State Route 22.\n\nMajor intersections\nThe entire route is in Oldham County.\nPassage 7:\nKentucky Route 155\nKentucky Route 155 (KY 155) is a 20.788-mile-long (33.455 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 31E and US 150 (Bardstown Road) in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other side of intersection, KY 155 becomes a local road called Trevilian Way. KY 155 continues through several Louisville suburbs to Jeffersontown, Kentucky and into Spencer County, where it eventually merges with Kentucky Route 55 a few miles north of Taylorsville, Kentucky.\nIt is known locally as Taylorsville Road from its northern terminus until a junction with Kentucky Route 148 in Jefferson County, where it is known as Taylorsville Lake Road until reaching its southern terminus. Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations.\nIt is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265.\n\nHistory\nKY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.\n\nMajor intersections\nSee also\nRoads in Louisville, Kentucky\nPassage 8:\nKentucky Route 28\nKentucky Route 28 (KY 28) is a 36.217-mile-long (58.286 km) state highway in the U.S. state of Kentucky that travels from KY 11 and KY 30 in Booneville to KY 15 in northern rural Perry County via Cow Creek, Arnett, Buckhorn, and Chavies. KY 28 begins in Booneville by traveling concurrently with KY 30 east while KY 30 west travels through town to the northwest. KY 30 veers off at the official beginning of KY 28 at Mulberry Street. KY 28 heads out of Booneville in Owsley County, heading southeast. About 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Booneville, KY 28 enters Breathitt County. After about 6 miles (9.7 km) through Breathitt County, KY 28 enters Perry County. KY 28 passes through the community of Buckhorn before making a short reentry into Breathitt County. After returning to Perry County, KY 28 passes through the community of Chavies before ending at KY 15 at Grapevine in Perry County.\n\nMajor intersections\nOwsley County + Breathitt County = 18.154\n\nSee also\n U.S. Roads portal\n United States portal\nPassage 9:\nKentucky Route 93\nKentucky Route 93 (KY 93) is a 27.734-mile (44.634 km) state highway in western Kentucky.\n\nRoute description\nThe route is separated into two segments. The southern segment runs from Kentucky Routes 139 and 276 southeast of the unincorporated community of Lamasco to Kentucky Route 810, Kentucky Route 819, and Iuka Ferry Road northwest of \nKuttawa via Lamasco, Confederate, and Eddyville. The northern segment runs from Kentucky Route 917 and Short Drive just east of Iuka to Kentucky Route 453 in rural Livingston County several miles east of Iuka via Iuka. It appears that the two segments were originally or meant to be connected, as both segments are just a few miles apart. It appears that they were to connect at the Cumberland River, at which the northern segment ends on the western bank and a rural road, likely what was or is to be part of KY 93, ends on the east bank.\n\nHistory\nKY 93 previously ran from the Tennessee State line in Trigg County to Fredonia via Cadiz, Eddyville and Kuttawa. KY 93 north of Eddyville is now US 641, while the highway from the Lyon-Caldwell-Trigg County tripoint southward is now signed as KY 139. \nKY 93 was reassigned to US 62's old alignment west of Kuttawa to Iuka via the now-discontinued ferry service when US 62 was reallocated to a new alignment providing a more-direct route to Paducah in the mid-1950s.\n\nMajor intersections\nPassage 10:\nKentucky Route 1065\nKentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065) is a 13.856-mile-long (22.299 km) state highway located in Louisville, Kentucky. The western terminus of the route is at Kentucky Route 907 a short distance west of Kentucky Route 841 (Gene Snyder Freeway) exit 6 in the Louisville neighborhood of Auburndale. The eastern terminus is at Kentucky Route 1819 in Fern Creek.\nThe route is known as the Outer Loop, Beulah Church Road, Seatonville Road, and Lovers Lane. It passes by what was the Louisville Motor Speedway and intersects Interstate 65 and the U.S. Route 31E/U.S. Route 150 concurrency.\n\nRoute description\nKY 1065 begins at an intersection with KY 907 in the Auburndale section of Louisville, heading east on two-lane undivided Outer Loop. The road crosses a CSX railroad line and heads between homes to the north and commercial establishments to the south. The route passes near shopping centers and comes to an intersection with KY 1865. KY 1065 continues through wooded areas with some nearby homes and commercial areas, reaching the KY 1020 junction. Past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads through areas of businesses and industry, coming to a bridge over a CSX railroad line. The road passes through more industrial areas and heads to the south of a landfill as a four-lane undivided road before becoming a divided highway again as it comes to an interchange with I-65.  Past this interchange, KY 1065 passes near residential neighborhoods prior to reaching an intersection with KY 61 in a commercial area. The road continues east past several shopping centers and passes to the south of Jefferson Mall. The route heads through residential areas with some businesses and intersects the southern terminus of KY 2052.\n\nKY 1065 becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and heads east through more suburban development. The route curves northeast and intersects KY 864, at which point it turns southeast to form a concurrency with that route on Beulah Church Road. The road curves east, and KY 864 splits to the south. KY 1065 continues east on two-lane Beulah Church Road and passes through wooded residential neighborhoods, curving to the northeast. The route turns east and comes to an intersection with US 31E/US 150. Past this intersection, the road becomes Seatonville Road and heads east through more wooded areas of homes. KY 1065 turns east onto Lovers Lane and winds north and east through areas of fields and homes.

Amongst other motor racing events, it has hosted the German Grand Prix, most recently in 2019. The circuit has very little differences in elevation. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.\n\nHistory\n1932–1938\nOriginally called \"Dreieckskurs\" (triangle course), the Hockenheimring was built in 1932. The man behind it is Ernst Christ, a young timekeeper who felt that a racing track should be built in his hometown of Hockenheim. He submitted the plans to the mayor and they were approved on Christmas day, in 1931. This first layout of the track was around twelve kilometres long and consisted of a large triangle-like section, a hairpin in the city and two straights connecting them.\n\n1938–1965\nIn 1938, the circuit dramatically shortened, from twelve kilometres down to just over seven and a half, and the Ostkurve corner, which lasted until 2001, was introduced for the first time.  In that year, the track was also renamed to \"Kurpfalzring\".  The track was damaged by tanks during World War II. After the war, the track was repaired, and renamed to \"Hockenheimring\". Former DKW and NSU factory rider and world record setter Wilhelm Herz became the manager of the track in 1954 and promoted the track successfully; Grand Prix motorcycle racing events were held, with the German motorcycle Grand Prix alternating between the Hockenheimring and other tracks.  This version of the circuit was just over seven and a half kilometres long and consisted of the original two long straights, with the Ostkurve in the forest and the original hairpin inside Hockenheim joining them together.\n\n1965–2001\nIn 1965, when the new Autobahn A 6 separated the village from the main part of the track, a new version of Hockenheim circuit was built, with the \"Motodrom\" stadium section, designed by John Hugenholtz, who also designed Suzuka. After Jim Clark was killed on 7 April 1968 in a Formula 2 racing accident, two fast chicanes were added and the track was lined with crash barriers in 1970. A small memorial was placed near the first chicane (which was named after him), at the site of his accident. In 1982, another chicane was added at the Ostkurve (east curve), after Patrick Depailler was killed there in 1980, and the first chicane was made slower as well. For the 1992 German Grand Prix, the Ostkurve was changed yet again, from a quick left turn into a more complex right-left-right chicane, after Érik Comas crashed there in 1991. The second chicane was renamed after Ayrton Senna, after his death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.\nThis version used to be quite large, with a very long and very fast section going through forests essentially consisting of four straights of roughly 1.3 km (0.81 mi), separated by a chicane sequence, followed by a more tight and twisty \"stadium\" section (so called because of all the grandstands situated there) named Motodrom. This made the setting up of racing cars difficult, since a choice had to be made – whether to run low downforce to optimize speed through the straights and compromise grip in the stadium section, or vice versa. The long track length also meant that a typical Formula One race had only 45 laps, limiting the spectators' experience of the race to only that many passes through the stadium.\nDuring the mid-1980s \"turbo era\" of Formula One where fuel was restricted to either 220 (1984–1985), 195 (1986–1987) or 150 (1988) litres for races for the turbo powered cars, Hockenheim also saw drivers, including World Champion Alain Prost, at times fail to finish due to simply running out of fuel near the end of the race. Prost ran out at the end of the 1986 race, pushing his McLaren towards the line before giving up. He was placed 3rd when he ran dry and was eventually classified 6th, gaining a valuable championship point that would help him with his second World Championship.\n\nMany problems came to light during the 2000 German Grand Prix, which was won by Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello from having started 18th on the grid. The race finished in changeable weather conditions, with pouring rain in the stadium sector and almost completely dry forest straights. All the overtaking moves that took place during the race were in the chicanes of the forest sector, meaning hardly any spectators saw most of the best action. Midway through the race, a former Mercedes-Benz employee, who had been dismissed, breached the track's security barriers on the first forest straight, showing vulnerable security facilities in the forest and leading to the deployment of the safety car that neutralized a comfortable lead for the two Mercedes-powered McLarens. Later on, French driver Jean Alesi collided with Brazilian Pedro Diniz in the braking zone for the third chicane and his car spun uncontrollably down the track, which caused him to suffer dizziness for three days.\nThese events prompted much protest from the FIA to greatly improve spectator viewing, safety, and security at the track, claiming that the track was no longer suited to modern Formula One racing.\n\n2002 redesign\nIn the early 2000s, F1 officials demanded the 6.823 km (4.240 mi) track be shortened and threatened to discontinue racing there, threatening to relocate to other tracks such as the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and sites in Asia. The state government of Baden-Württemberg secured the financing for the redesign by Hermann Tilke for the 2002 German Grand Prix. The stadium section remained mostly intact, despite a new surface and a tighter Turn 1 (\"Nordkurve\"). However, the circuit was dramatically shortened, with the long, forested straights section chopped off in favour of more tight corners. More than half of the first straight and almost all of the straight between the Ostkurve and Senna chicane were cut and the rest was connected with a new long straight called the \"Parabolika\", with a small kink being added between the first straight and the new one. A small right-left-right complex was added to the remaining part of the final straight, with a new grandstand overlooking it. In an extremely controversial move, the old forest section was torn up and replanted with trees, eliminating any chance of using the old course either for future F1 events or for historic car events.\nThere was and still remains a great deal of criticism of the track redesign, in terms of ruining the previous unique technical challenges of the old Hockenheim circuit and delivering a new homogenised \"assembly line\" circuit without the character of the previous layout, whilst being beset by the perceived problems of other Tilke circuits. Several drivers and team principals, including Ron Dennis, Jarno Trulli and Juan Pablo Montoya, criticised the changes and stated their preference for the old circuit.The change in the track layout also saw the installation of a new memorial to Jim Clark. This is located at the outside of the current track's turn 2, where the old track continued out into the forests, and the new shortened track turns to the right.The new track has a seating capacity of 120,000, due to new large grandstands sponsored by Mercedes-Benz. The complex also features a quarter-mile track for drag racing. It hosts one of the largest drag racing events in Europe, known as the NitrOlympx, and was one of the last Top Fuel circuits to race to 0.25 miles (0.40 km) before the FIA switched the nitro categories to the now-recognised 1,000 feet (300 m) distance in 2012.\n\nFormula One\nThe Hockenheim Circuit hosted the German Grand Prix for the first time in 1970 when the F1 drivers decided at the French Grand Prix to boycott the allegedly dangerous Nürburgring unless major changes were made. The next year the German Grand Prix went back to the Nürburgring until the 1976 German Grand Prix. From 1977 to 2006, the Hockenheimring hosted the German Grand Prix with the exception of 1985, when the race was held at the reconfigured Nürburgring.\nIn July 2006, Bernie Ecclestone announced that from 2007 onwards, there would be only one Grand Prix per year in Germany. Since 1995, there had been two Grands Prix every year in Germany; the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, plus either the European Grand Prix or the Luxembourg Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. From 2007, the Nürburgring and Hockenheimring alternated hosting the German Grand Prix, starting with the Nürburgring in 2007.\n\nOngoing deficits of the Formula One races, amounting to up to 5.3 million Euro per race that had to be covered by the local communities, made it likely the contract between the Hockenheimring and Formula One Management would not be extended after the Grand Prix of 2010. However, in October 2009 the contract for the circuit to hold the German GP was extended to 2018, with the FOA agreeing to cover any losses the event incurs. Neither Hockenheim nor the Nürburgring hosted a Grand Prix in 2015 or 2017 after the Nürburgring failed to complete an agreement with Formula 1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone.\n\nDrag racing (NitrolympX – Rico Anthes Quartermile)\nFrom 1986 to 1988, the start–finish straight was used for 1/8 mile drag racing. In 1989, a proper drag strip was built by connecting the Opel-Kurve and the first turn entering the Motodrom section. The finish line was at the beginning of the forest, with a very long run-off on the straight in the forest. Competitors had to travel around the full race track in opposite direction to return to the paddock.\nThe drag strip is only used for two events in August, the Public Race Days and the NitrolympX main event a week later. Originally named the Nitrolympics and featuring Top Fuel dragsters, it was renamed to NitrolympX.\nWhen the Hockenheimring was shortened in 2002, the drag strip was moved back, closer to the new tall Tower stands that allow an unusual view along the drag strip. Even though the run off was cut in half it remains one of the longest in drag racing. The NitrolympX usually host most European Drag Racing Championship, sanctioned by FIA or FIM, plus jet dragsters and other entertaining events on the Saturday night show that draws 40,000 spectators.The drag strip in 2008 was christened Rico Anthes Quartermile after the German former Top Fuel driver and long-time organizer of the NitrolympX had retired in 2007. As the dragstrip can only be prepared for professional drag racing after the last major circuit event, mainly the Formula One race, the grip is often sub par compared to permanent drag strips that host two Euro Championship events each year, like Santa Pod Raceway in England or Tierp Arena in Sweden. The best performances on the full quarter-mile were significantly below those in Santa Pod, and the best ET was set in 2005: 4.873 sec. and 458 km/h by Brady Kalivoda (USA).In 2012, some Pro classes could not find traction as Formula One had demanded a new surface. In subsequent years, the organizers provided a better track, with support from Santa Pod personnel and machinery. In 2016, Hockenheim, and mainland Europe, finally saw the first 3-second Top Fuel 1000 ft passes, with 3.939 sec. and 486.91 km/h by Anita Mäkelä (FIN). An overall European record for Super Street Bike was set by Garry Bowe (GB) with 7.04s 340,69 km/h.\n\nDTM\nThe DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series has regularly raced at the Hockenheimring since its revival in 2000. In most years, the DTM has competed there twice during a season.\n\nRallycross\nLocated in the stadia section of the track, the rallycross track uses a section of track from turns 11 to 16, combined with a dirt section in front of the grandstands. It hosted first ever World RX of Hockenheim, round 2 of FIA World Rallycross Championship in 2015 as supporting event of DTM. WRX also combined with the DTM for an event there in 2017.\n\nLayout history\nCurrent circuit configurations\nPrevious configurations\nLap records\nOfficial record lap times are only set during the race. The fastest ever lap on the track is 1:11.212 set by Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari SF71H during qualifying at the 2018 German Grand Prix.

He made his professional debut during the 2014/15 season.\nPassage 2:\nDiego Luz\nDiego Alexander Luz Pizarro (born 3 July 1990) is an Uruguayan professional football (soccer) player. He played for Club Sportivo Miramar Misiones, Club Atlético Rentistas, Central Español Fútbol Club and Huracán del Paso de la Arena. Known for playmaking skills, range of passing and crossing ability, bending free-kicks with both legs and head goals. Since 2017 he plays for Huracán Buceo.\n\nEarly career\nLuz's professional club career began with Miramar Misiones, where he made his first-team debut in 2007 at the age of 17. He played for two seasons with Miramar Misiones, contributing to the promotion to First Professional League.\nHe then played one season with Rentistas, winning the championship of the Second League and getting the promotion to the First Professional League. He also played one season with Central Español and three seasons with Huracán del Paso de la Arena. In 2017, he plays for Huracán Buceo.\n\nEarly life\nLuz was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. He is the son of Silvia Pizarro and Wilmen Luz. He has two younger brothers Claudio and Nahuel Luz. He regularly played football as a child, and attended Portones Primary School and Jose Pedro Varela High School.\nPassage 3:\nCristian Jeandet\nCristian Daniel Jeandet (born March 1, 1975) is a retired Argentine football striker. He retired in December 2015 after playing in 23 clubs and in the top-leagues of eight different countries: Argentina, Italy, FR Yugoslavia, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Morocco and Venezuela. He is regarded along Lutz Pfannenstiel and Sebastián Abreu among the best known globetrotters.\n\nCareer\nBeginnings and Newell's\nBorn in Concordia, Entre Ríos, Argentina, he started playing in local side Estudiantes Concordia when he was 12.  By his own words, he scored 60 goals in 23 games in first year, and 73 goals in 36 games in next one, receiving, an award as the recognition of the record of goals in youth levels, by then, at the city of Paraná, Entre Ríos. After that, Newell's Old Boys coach, Marcelo Bielsa, took him after trials. Jeandet spent 6 years at youth levels of Newell's, reaching promotion to the first team but without ever debuting in the league. Then what followed were loans, first six months to Ferrocaril de Concordia playing at Torneo Argentino A in 1995–96, but failed to qualify to final stage of the tournament, and next to same level club Patronato, in 1996–97, reaching with them the semi-finals.\n\nEurope: Italy and Yugoslavia\nAfter the loans at Argentino A, Jeandet left Newell's and joined Lanús.  He faced tough competition for a spot in the team from older and more experienced Claudio Enría and Ariel \"Chupa\" López. He failed to debut in the league, so he left, this time moving abroad, crossing the Atlantic, and settling in Italy. First he played with Fidelis Andria, competing in Serie B at that time, and making 4 appearances. Next, he played with Casertana F.C. and Fidenza.  He experienced difficulties adapting, so he decided during the winter-break of 1999–2000 to cross the Adriatic and join Serbian side Sartid Smederevo playing back then in the First League of FR Yugoslavia. He stayed six months in Yugoslavia, leaving Sartid at the end of the season. In between, he also apent some time in Switzerland with FC Lugano.\n\nBack to South America\nAfter leaving Sartid, Jeandet crossed back the Atlantic, but instead of returning to his native Argentina, he went to Chile where he joined Palestino. There were three more Argentinian players in the club and Jeandet adapted well, however not long afterwards, the club changed the coach and Argentinian Ricardo Dabrowski was brought, who said Jeandet was not in his plans. That meant the end of the short spell at Palestino in Chile, and Jeandet returned to Argentina. Dalcio Giovagnoli informed him about the ambitious project Central Córdoba was having under way at the time. Several Jeandet's former colleagues from Newell's were also playing at that time at the club, and Jeandet spent a solid 2000–01 season with Central Córdoba. They reached the \"octogonal\" with Jeandet scoring 9 goals in the process, but were eliminated in the 1/8 finals by Instituto de Córdoba which were strong and coached by Gerardo \"Tata\" Martino. Jeandet moved precisely to Instituto for the next season, but with Tito Martino already gone, and not getting many chances as a starter in the line-up, Jeandet opted to leave as soon as a good offer from Bolivian side Blooming arrived through his agent.\n\nPeru\nThe arrival to a major Bolivian club looked initially promising, however the club at the time was experiencing major difficulties. After three months at Blooming the situation became unsustainable; several coaches changed and the players were receiving no salaries and were on strike. Jeandet decided to leave, and left Bolivia and moved to Peru where he joined Club Aurora. He stayed at Aurora six very important months for the club, since Jeandet was crucial in the squad from Cochabamba that won the 2002 Copa Simón Bolívar thus earning promotion after 14 years to the Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano, the national top tier. Jeandet scored two goals in the decisive victory of Aurora over Fancesa by 5–1.Next, he joined Peruvian top-league side Sport Boys where he played coached by his compatriot Jorge Sampaoli during 2003. At the time his daughter Catalina was about to born, his wife wanted to have her in Argentina. By that time, Jeandet was approached by Cienciano president with an offer to join the club and become their main striker in their upcoming Copa Sudamericana campaign, but with Jeandet disbelief of Cienciano doing well in the Copa, and the disadvantage of that meaning a move to Cusco, Peru, over his wife's desire to return to Argentina, Jeandet dropped the offer from Cienciano and joined Argentinian side Gimnasia y Esgrima. Playing in the Primera B Nacional, they finished the season relegated. Besides the bad sporting result, the club also failed to pay the last six salaries, which meant also a bad financial decision for him, and to make the bad choice even harder, Cienciano surprisingly won the Copa Sudamericana that season, and consequently, the Recopa Sudamericana as well.\n\nGlobetrotter: Morocco and Venezuela\nAfter this disastrous decision, Jeandet was decided to reanimate his career. After spells at Sarmiento de Junin and Estudiantes de Buenos Aires he moved again abroad. After trials in Austria, he joined in 2007, along Claudio Ortiz, Wydad Casablanca, becoming the first Argentinians to play in the Moroccan top league, the Botola. He played with Wydad in the CAF Champions League. The African adventure was followed by a trip to Venezuela where he played with Mineros de Guayana.\n\nBack to Argentina\nAfter Venezuela, he returned to Argentina and in the following years he had spells with Villa Dálmine, Sarmiento de Leones, Almagro, Deportivo Laferrere, Unión Aconquija, General Paz Juniors, Talleres de Perico and Sarmiento Leones.\n\nPersonal life\nCriistian Jeandet has four children, the older one, Catalina, then Constanza, Jeremías and Felipe. By spring 2014, Jeremías was playing football in Belgrano as striker.\n\nHonors\nAuroraCopa Simón Bolívar: 2002Individual:\n\nTorneo Argentino B top-scorer: 2012–13 (22 goals)\nPassage 4:\nJonathan Blanes\nJonathan Blanes Núñez (born March 10, 1987 in Paysandú) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for River Plate in the Uruguayan Primera División.\n\nHonours\nClub\nRacing Club2007-2008 Uruguayan Segunda División championship\nPassage 5:\nJonathan Urretaviscaya\nJonathan Matías Urretaviscaya da Luz (born 19 March 1990) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays for Boston River as a right winger.\n\nClub career\nBorn in Montevideo to a father of Basque descent, Urretaviscaya started off his career with hometown's Club Atlético River Plate. His Primera División debut came one month shy of his 18th birthday as he scored in a 2–0 win against Liverpool Montevideo in the Clausura's first game, and he eventually netted nine goals overall for the runners-up.Urretaviscaya signed a contract with Portuguese club S.L. Benfica on 2 July 2008, for a fee of €1.5 million, being rarely used in his debut season. In January 2010, after having made almost no official appearances during the campaign – his only Primeira Liga game was against FC Porto as his team had many players missing due to injuries and suspensions, and he put up a good performance in a 1–0 home win for the eventual champions– he was loaned to Peñarol for five months, thus returning to his country.In late June 2010, Urretaviscaya was loaned to Deportivo de La Coruña in a season-long move. In the following transfer window, however, he returned to Peñarol in the same situation.For 2011–12, Urretaviscaya returned to Portugal, being loaned to Vitória S.C. while also renewing his contract until 2015. He went on to miss most of the campaign, due to injury.Subsequently, returned to the Estádio da Luz, Urretaviscaya spent the better part of the following two seasons with the B team. On 1 September 2014 he terminated his contract with Benfica and penned a one-year deal with F.C. Paços de Ferreira.Urretaviscaya re-joined Peñarol for a third spell on 23 January 2015, after signing for six months. He was on the move again the following June, joining C.F. Pachuca in the Mexican Liga MX.\n\nInternational career\nUrretaviscaya was part of the Uruguayan squad that competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, held in London. He earned his first cap for the full side on 28 March 2017: after having come on as a second-half substitute for Carlos Sánchez, he received two yellow cards in 11 minutes and was thus sent off, in a 2–1 away loss to Peru for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.On 2 June 2018, Urretaviscaya was selected for the finals in Russia by manager Óscar Tabárez. He made his debut in the competition on 6 July, playing 17 minutes in the 2–0 quarter-final defeat against France after replacing Nahitan Nández.\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nAs of 16 December 2017\n\nInternational\nAs of match played 7 September 2018\n\nHonours\nBenfica\n\nPrimeira Liga: 2009–10\nTaça da Liga: 2009–10\nUEFA Europa League runner-up: 2012–13Peñarol\n\nUruguayan Primera División: 2009–10\nCopa Libertadores runner-up: 2011Pachuca\n\nLiga MX: Clausura 2016\nCONCACAF Champions League: 2016–17Monterrey\n\nLiga MX: Apertura 2019\nCONCACAF Champions League: 2019Individual\n\nFIFA Club World Cup: Bronze Ball 2017\nPassage 6:\nDiego Vicente\nDiego Sebastián Vicente Pereyra (born July 19, 1998)  is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for Danubio in the Uruguayan Segunda División.\n\nClub career\nVicente started his career playing with River Plate. He made his professional debut during the 2015/16 season.\nPassage 7:\nSebastián Abreu\nWashington Sebastián Abreu Gallo (Spanish pronunciation: [seβasˈtjan aˈβɾew]; born 17 October 1976) is a Uruguayan football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is the current manager of Peruvian club Universidad César Vallejo.\nHe is best known for his record of appearing for 32 teams in 11 countries during his professional career. Nicknamed Loco (Madman in Spanish), the prolific scorer for club and national team initially retired in 2021 after a four-month stint with Sud América, but later that same year came out of retirement with Olimpia de Minas.A Uruguayan international for more than 15 years, Abreu represented his country in two World Cups and three Copa América tournaments, winning the latter in 2011.\n\nPlaying career\nClub\nEarly career\nBorn in Minas, Lavalleja Department, Abreu played in numerous clubs throughout the Americas (Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil). He also had an unsuccessful stint with Spain's Deportivo de La Coruña, which loaned him several times for the duration of his contract.In his sole season in La Liga, which started in January 1998, having been signed from San Lorenzo, Abreu scored for the Galicians in a 3–1 home defeat of Barcelona on 25 January.\n\nRiver Plate and Beitar\nAfter having joined Mexico's UANL in 2007, Abreu was able to rescind his contract with them in order to join River Plate – the Mexican Football Federation stalled on recognising the transfer because of an imposed moratorium between the clubs. He became the only foreigner to score in the Clásico Regiomontano (Tigres vs. Monterrey, which he represented the previous year) against each team.In the middle of 2008, after exhausting negotiations, Abreu signed a deal with Israeli League champions Beitar Jerusalem. He appeared in the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League, but his team was quickly eliminated. Additionally, he could not play in the domestic front due to lack of payment.\nAbreu re-signed with River Plate in September 2008 after terminating his link with Beitar, with a deal lasting until June 2009. Due to being a late addition, he was not able to play for the side in the Primera División, only featuring in the Copa Sudamericana. The next year, he was eligible for both the domestic and Copa Libertadores fronts.\n\nReal Sociedad\nIn early January 2009, Abreu returned to Spain after a ten-year absence, being loaned by River to Segunda División side Real Sociedad, which had lost habitual first choice Iñigo Díaz de Cerio for the season due to a serious leg injury.On 14 March 2009, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 away win against league leaders Xerez. His team, however, ultimately failed in returning to the top flight.\n\nBotafogo\nOn 13 June 2009, Aris in Greece signed Abreu from River Plate. However, in January of the following year, the 33-year-old changed club and country again, agreeing on a two-year contract with Brazil's Botafogo.Abreu scored the second goal in the 2–1 victory over Flamengo on 18 April 2010, which gave the team the Campeonato Carioca title. In July, he had his link extended until 31 December 2012 with a release clause of US$11.3 million, with the player declaring he had previously held talks with Universidad de Chile and Trabzonspor of Turkey.On 6 February 2011, Abreu was involved in a dramatic match against Fluminense: his team won a penalty kick as they were losing 2–1, and he shot it in Panenka-style, with Diego Cavalieri saving the shot by simply standing still. Another penalty was awarded just five minutes later, and he shot it in the same fashion, this time into the right-hand corner of the goal, as the goalkeeper dived the other way; a few minutes later, Botafogo scored again and won the game.Abreu was loaned to fellow Série A side Figueirense on 5 July 2012. However, as the season went on to end in relegation, his contract was ended via Twitter on 24 November, one day before the last game against Grêmio.\n\nSol de América\nFrom January 2013 to December 2015, Abreu was under contract to Nacional, also being loaned to Rosario Central and Aucas during this timeframe. On 28 December 2015, Paraguayan newspaper D10 reported that he had met in Uruguay with Sol de América chairman Miguel Figueredo. He had already received a more lucrative offer from Mexico, but declined in order to be closer to his country, and was officially confirmed on 6 January 2016.\n\nBangu\nOn 12 November 2016, 40-year-old Abreu joined Brazil's Bangu from Santa Tecla, with the deal being made effective the following January. After ten appearances in the Rio de Janeiro State League, he left.\n\nLater years\nOn 4 April 2017, Abreu signed with Montevideo-based team Central Español of the Uruguayan Segunda División. In late December of the same year, he joined Chilean Primera División's Audax Italiano from Puerto Montt, in the same country but one level below; this transfer broke a world record, as it marked him as the first player to have played for 26 professional clubs.Abreu returned to Brazil in December 2018 at age 42, agreeing to a contract at Série D's Rio Branco. He returned to his homeland the following July, signing with Boston River and making his Primera División debut in a 0–0 draw against River Plate where he donned jersey number 113.On 8 February 2021, Abreu signed for Athletic Club in Brazil. After four matches in the Campeonato Mineiro, he terminated his contract on 21 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On 30 March 2021, Abreu joined newly promoted Uruguayan top-tier club Sud América. On 10 June, he announced his decision to retire from professional football, and it was reported on news the game against Liverpool the following day would be his last.Abreu's hometown side Olimpia de Minas announced on 29 August 2021 that he would briefly come out of retirement to play for them in the local Campeonato Minuano. He finished as champion of the +40 category tournament of ADIC (Asociación Deportiva de Integración Colegial), and also top scorer with 17 goals in 11 matches for the amateur (college) team Colegio Jesús María 2019, being the second championship won in the year after the Apertura, where he also ranked first in the scoring charts.\n\nInternational\nAbreu played for Uruguay at the 2002 FIFA World Cup – three matches – and the 1997, 2007 and 2011 Copa América editions, netting twice in the latter. He made his debut for the national side on 17 July 1996 in a friendly with China, going on to earn 70 caps.On 27 May 2010, Abreu stood only five goals short of Uruguayan all-time goalscoring record, held by Héctor Scarone for 79 years. He was selected for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, where he appeared three times as a substitute; in the quarter-finals against Ghana he scored the decisive penalty shootout attempt (1–1 after 120 minutes), a Panenka to send his team to the semi-finals for the first time in 40 years.\n\nCoaching career\nOn 26 April 2019, Abreu was announced as the interim manager of Santa Tecla on an initial one-and-a-half month spell, with the parties holding the option open of keeping him as a player-coach or just as a player afterwards. He won the Copa El Salvador four days later, defeating Audaz 1–0 in the final.In December 2019, Abreu was appointed player-coach at Boston River ahead of the upcoming campaign in the Uruguayan Primera División.

(Watt, 1985)  The founding of this Christian place of worship is associated with St. Nathalan. who lived circa 650 AD.  The structure is alternatively known as Cowie Chapel.\nThe chapel is at the point where the Highland Boundary Fault meets the sea and so is on the dividing line between the highlands and lowlands of Scotland.\n\nArea history\nThe Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan is one of the oldest surviving structures in Kincardineshire.  About one kilometre to the west is the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which was constructed on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south of Stonehaven into Aberdeen. This route specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Muchalls Castle and Cowie Castle from the south. (Hogan, 2007) The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Marquess of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the battle of the Civil War in 1639.\n\nSee also\nDoonie Point\nLimpet Burn\nRed Cloak\nPassage 2:\nInverallochy Castle\nInverallochy Castle is a ruined courtyard castle, near the village of Inverallochy in the Buchan area of North-East Scotland, dating to 1504. It lies 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of Cairnbulg Castle, near Fraserburgh, and formerly stood beside the now-drained Loch of Inverallochy. It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire.\n\nDescription\nThe remains of buildings are arranged around three sides of a courtyard, with a curtain wall across the south side. A tower in the north-east corner remains largely to its full height, while the remaining curtain wall stands up to 10 m high. The internal walls have largely collapsed. Evidence of a larger outer courtyard measuring approximately 60 metres (200 ft) square to the north and east remains. The ruins are protected as a scheduled monument. The castle appears to have all been built at once, and architectural evidence suggests an early 16th-century date. It may have been the work of Sir William Comyn (or Cumyng) of Inverallochy, who was Lord Lyon in 1512–1519.\n\nInscribed stone\nUntil the latter half of the 18th century, there was a stone inserted above the entrance, bearing the sculptured arms of the Comyns, with an inscription \"recording that the estate around it was obtained by Jordan Comyn for building the abbey of Deer\".\nPassage 3:\nCowie Bridge\nCowie Bridge is a roadway bridge which carries the B979 across the mouth of the Cowie Water in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  \nHistorically, the area in the vicinity of the Cowie Bridge site has been an old fishing village known as Cowie Village.  Between the Cowie Bridge and the North Sea, a new pedestrian bridge is planned, which will also support a new pipeline structure.  The site of Cowie Bridge is approximately the point of the southern terminus of the Causey Mounth trackway, which was the only available medieval route crossing the coastal Grampian Mountains northerly by way of Muchalls Castle and Gillybrands.\n\nSee also\nCowie Castle\nChapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan\nPassage 4:\nAllardice Castle\nAllardice Castle (also spelled Allardyce) is a sixteenth-century manor house in Kincardineshire, Scotland. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres north-west of the town of Inverbervie.  The Bervie Water flows around Allardice Castle on both sides. Allardice may be viewed as one of a chain of coastal castles; to the north are Dunnottar Castle (ruined), Fetteresso Castle, Cowie Castle (ruined) and Muchalls Castle. The castle is a category A listed building. Allardice castle was the chief seat of the Barons of Allardice, an ancient family who first appear in an 1197 charter. Since 1542 (the time at which the current L-plan building was built) many alterations and changes have been made to the original structure.\nPassage 5:\nStonehaven Bay\nStonehaven Bay is a natural harbour in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The town of Stonehaven is built along the shore of Stonehaven Bay. The mouths of the Carron Water and the Cowie Water are both situated in Stonehaven, within the Bay.\nPassage 6:\nBervie Water\nBervie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Bhiorbhaigh) is a river in Aberdeenshire, Scotland which rises in the Drumtochty Forest and flows across The Mearns to reach the North Sea at Inverbervie.  Approximately two kilometres upstream of the North Sea, the Bervie Water flows through the grounds of Allardice Castle.  The Bothenoth Burn (Burn of Healing) joins the Bervie Water to the east of Arbuthnott House. At Arbuthnott the river forms a steep-sided valley where gardens were laid out on the south-facing slope. It is a series of four terraces across which run diagonal intersecting grass paths.\n\nSee also\nCarron Water, Aberdeenshire Media related to Bervie Water at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 7:\nCowie Castle\nCowie Castle is a ruined fortress in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.  The site lies at the northern end of Stonehaven on the North Sea coast.  To the immediate south is the Cowie Bridge crossing of the Cowie Water.  Evidence of prehistoric man exists in the vicinity dating to the Iron Age in the form of ring cairns.\n\nStrategic location\nThe ancient Causey Mounth trackway was developed at least as early as the eleventh century AD to connect the coastal portion of Stonehaven to a crossing of the River Dee at the southern edge of Aberdeen.  This strategic route in the Middle Ages fit with the coastal defences of the fortresses of Dunnottar Castle and Cowie Castle, controlling land and sea movements of military units.  Cowie Castle at the north of Stonehaven effectively controlled all coastal land and sea movements to the north.  Proceeding north from Cowie Castle, the Causey Mounth crosses the Burn of Muchalls at the Bridge of Muchalls and thence proceeds northward past Muchalls Castle.  The trackway passes the ruins of the Episcopal Chapels, dating to 1624 situated on the lands of the Muchalls Castle Estate, and thence northerly crossing through the boggy Portlethen Moss (which had a much larger historic extent than present). Cowie Castle is also situated near the southern end of the Elsick Mounth, another strategic route used by the Romans in their northern invasion and also instrumental in subsequent eras' military movements.\nOther nearby castles are the ruined Dunnottar Castle to the south, Fetteresso Castle to the south-west and Muchalls Castle to the north.  St. Nathalan is said to have founded the ruined Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan immediately north of the Cowie Castle site.\n\nThe castle\nCowie is thought to have been the site of a royal hunting lodge in the Middle Ages, and may have served as a royal lodging during progresses through the north-east of Scotland. Only a small section of masonry survives today on the site, which is a scheduled monument.\n\nSee also\nBarony of Cowie\nCowie Village\nFiddes Castle\nPassage 8:\nCowie Water\nThe Cowie Water (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Chollaidh) is a river of Scotland.\n\nGeography\nThe river rises in the Grampian Mountains in Kincardineshire, and discharges to the North Sea in the northern part of Stonehaven, south of the ruined Cowie Castle. Tributaries of the Cowie Water include the Burn of Monboys, which drains the area to the north, in which the archaeological site Raedykes Roman Camp is situated; and Cowton Burn.\nNotable features in this vicinity include Dunnottar Castle, Fetteresso Castle and Muchalls Castle.  Other nearby coastal waterways discharging to the North Sea include Burn of Muchalls to the north and Carron Water to the south.\n\nHydrology and water quality\nSummer flow rates are typically in the range of 200 cubic feet per second (5.7 m3/s) at the river's mouth.  July values for pH have been measured at 8.2 or slightly alkaline  July water temperatures are about 11.9 degrees Celsius and electrical conductivity at Cowie Bridge near the mouth has been measured at a relatively low value of .07 micro-Siemens per meter.  Turbidity measured exactly 24 hours after a moderate rainfall of one centimeter was 14 JTU in a July circumstance.\n\nSee also\nBarony of Cowie\nUry House\n\nLine notes\n Media related to Cowie Water at Wikimedia Commons\nPassage 9:\nMearns FM\nMearns FM is a community run radio station  based in the North East of Scotland.  There are transmitters in Laurencekirk, Inverbervie, Stonehaven and Portlethen leading to a coverage area stretching from St Cyrus to Aberdeen.  The studio is located in Stonehaven.\n\nHistory\nIn 1993, Community Radio in the Mearns area began following a visit to North East Community Radio by members of the Stonehaven Community Centre Management Committee. Stonehaven Community Radio was subsequently formed, and it transmitted for the first time during July 1994 from the old primary school toilet block in Stonehaven Community Centre.  At that time, community stations could only operate for 28 days at a time. The group disbanded in 1998.In 2004, five year community radio licences were introduced, which led to the formation of a new group of enthusiasts. A draft constitution was adopted at the first AGM which was held in the late Summer of 2005. The project was delayed because a round of broadcasting applications had just closed and Ofcom, the regulating authority, did not invite new applications until the late autumn of 2006. It was necessary for the organisation to become a Company Limited by Guarantee and a registered charity.The committee originally planned the station to be named Stonehaven Community Radio but it was decided to become Mearns wide and be called Mearns FM.  Because of the large geographical area of the Mearns, the station applied for three transmitters which Ofcom subsequently agreed to and a licence was issued in early July 2007.The station began broadcasting on 6 June 2009 during the annual Feein' Market in Stonehaven. At 11am the station was officially opened by the local MP, Sir Robert Smith.Since then OFCOM have renewed our license to broadcast twice and we are able to keep broadcasting until at least 2024.\nIn 2016, the station was the only Community Radio Station in Scotland to receive accreditation from the BBC for Eurovision Song Contest coverage.In April 2020 Mearns FM was successful in a bid to increase power at all 3 transmitters and install a new transmitter at Portlethen church hall. This will improve coverage across South Aberdeenshire, half the funding needed to replace 4 transmitters was granted from Aberdeenshire Council and we are very grateful for that help. We will also open a new studio in Portlethen church hall part-financed by the National Lottery awards for all program. Mearns FM also launched on DAB digital radio across North-East Scotland in July 2020.\n\nStudio\nThe station was broadcast from Stonehaven Town Hall from its inception in 2007 until late 2019, when it had to move due to electrical upgrades taking place in the town hall. After broadcasting from temporary studios, the station moved permanently to a new studio on Ann Street on 13 September 2020.\n\nProgramming\nPrograms did include the self-proclaimed \"world's only Doric show\". Every Sunday at 9am, the previous Sunday's worship service of Bervie Church is broadcast.\nPassage 10:\nFetteresso Castle\nFetteresso Castle is a 14th-century tower house, rebuilt in 1761 as a Scottish Gothic style Palladian manor, with clear evidence of prehistoric use of the site. It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway. Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House.\n\nPrehistory\nFrom cropmarks in the \"policies\" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus. A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends say that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in AD 954. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles north-west, where a full legion encamped and many archaeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray.\n\nMiddle Ages\nThe property is recorded to have been owned by the Strachans.\nRobert de Bruce opposed the Balliol (and later the Comyn) claim to the throne of Scotland, which culminated at the Battle of Barra Hill (1308). Castlehill of Strachan was in fact burned out by Robert de Bruce, and the Barony of Strachan later disinherited from the de Strachan family and granted by Robert de Bruce to Sir Alexander Fraser in c. 1316 (Robertson Index, 1-15). The Strachan family were supporters and kinsmen of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan.\nThe barony of Fetteresso eventually passed to William Keith, the Earl Marischal of Scotland, who inherited the barony through his mother, the daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser in the 14th century to the Clan Keith Earls Marischal, who built the tower house. The Earls Marischal also held the nearby fortress, Dunnottar Castle.\n\n17th and 18th centuries\nThe characteristic Scottish designs of crow-stepped gables and the battlement crenellation elements were introduced. A dovecote of considerable height was constructed in the 17th century to the south of the castle. In 1659 Jean Hunter lived at Fetteresso. She was accused of witchcraft and hanged at her home. An artist and wright named Alexander Charles worked at Fetteresso as an overseer. Charles flourished from 1671 to 1678 and published his drawings in at least one book. Late in the 17th century, the Duff family controlled Fetteresso and expanded the building around the old tower house.\n\n20th and 21st centuries\nIn the 1940s, the castle was owned by Maurice Simpson and Geraldine Simpson (née Pringle). She was the heir to the Pringle knitware fortune. Subsequently, the Simpsons acquired and lived in nearby Muchalls Castle. After the Simpsons' tenure at Fetteresso, the roof was off the castle for some period starting around 1954, and the castle was bought by a local landowner and then left to the Don family in his will. In the latter part of the 20th century, the castle was restored, greatly modified, to yield seven houses, which is its present use. Ms Simpson continued to reside in the local area until her death in 2010.\n\nSee also\nAllardice Castle\nKirkton of Fetteresso\nRed Cloak\nStonehaven Tolbooth\nUry House\n\nBibliography\nC.

It is based on the novel Native Son by American author Richard Wright, who also stars in the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Chenal. Actor Canada Lee, who was originally scheduled to play the film's protagonist Bigger Thomas, had difficulties with his visa while filming Cry, the Beloved Country (1951) in South Africa and had to decline the role; with the whole production in jeopardy due to the mishap, Wright decided to step in and replace Lee.Due to its controversial plot, the film received severe editing in the United States, which removed about 30 minutes. A restored cut premiered on Turner Classic Movies on February 20, 2021, for the film's 60th anniversary.\nNative Son was later remade in two adaptations: one in 1986 and another in 2019.\n\nPlot summary\nA young black man, Bigger Thomas, is hired as a chauffeur for a progressive, affluent white family living in Chicago in the early 1940s. That evening, he drives their teenage daughter Mary into town to meet left-wing sympathizers. Their attempts to befriend Bigger are baffling to him because no white person has ever been kind to him and reflect how oblivious they are to the reactions of the black man.\nMary gets so drunk with her boyfriend, Jan, that she passes out.  Bigger takes Mary home and carries her to bed. Mary makes advances to Bigger so he kisses her. Mrs. Dalton, who is blind, suddenly opens Mary's door.  Bigger panics and covers her mouth with a pillow. Mary cannot breathe, and he accidentally smothers her to death. Mrs. Dalton merely thinks that Mary has passed out from being drunk and leaves the room.  Bigger moves the body and puts her in the basement furnace, trying to cover up what happened.\nA group of reporters, relegated to the furnace room of the house, notice fragments of bone and an earring in the ashes, prompting Bigger to flee in terror. He joins his girlfriend Bessie, a nightclub singer, in an abandoned building, but when she goes to a drug store for liquor and a sweater for him, Bigger thinks she has conspired with stool pigeon Snippy to put the police onto him, and he murders her, throwing her body into an elevator shaft. He flees the building, but the police give chase, turning a hose on him and forcing his surrender.\nHe is defended by a leftist lawyer with support from Jan, who worked with Mary toward racial equality. Max, the lawyer, fails to overcome the racism of the judge and jury and Bigger is sentenced to death. When Max tearfully says goodbye to Bigger for the last time, Bigger asks him to \"say hello to Mr... to Jan\". Bigger had found two white people capable of kindness to him; all the others put him to death.\n\nCast\nRichard Wright ... Bigger Thomas\nWilla Pearl Curtis ... Mrs. Hannah Thomas\nGloria Madison ...

Richard Wright was a particular fan of film noir, and director Chenal was a pioneer in the style. He was the first to make a film treatment of the novel The Postman Always Rings Twice, and there are many parallels between Native Son and that film noir classic. Regarding the movie's status as a film noir, writers have noted its similarities to this style, stating it has \"noir touches\" and \"the unmistakable feel of noir\", and that it \"does justice to the noir style.\" Other writers have gone further, stating it is \"good noir\" or \"darkly satiric noir\", and \"genuine noir.\" One writer expounded \"indeed it is [film noir] ... Not only in terms of the visual style but in terms of moral ambiguity.\"\n\nProduction\nCasting\nWhile Bigger is 20 years old in the novel, he is about 25 in this version.Americans were the primary actors while Latin Americans and Argentines of African descent had smaller roles.\n\nDevelopment\nThe history of this movie started with the Broadway version of Richard Wright's novel Native Son, produced by Orson Welles. Welles worked with playwright Paul Green and Richard Wright himself on the adaptation. MGM offered Wright $25,000 for the film rights to the novel, but they insisted the movie be cast with white actors exclusively. The independent producer Harold Hecht proposed to make the film, but wanted Bigger to be a white man of an oppressed ethnic background rather than a black man. Wright declined both.\nWright ultimately agreed to a proposal by French director Pierre Chenal to film his version. Chenal's film was greatly influenced by Welles' version and took it as its starting point.France and Italy were approached for location, but both countries refused to grant the requisite permits; they were recipients of US economic aid from the Marshall Plan and were afraid of repercussions if they hosted such an incendiary film. Wright and Chanal then turned to Argentina, where Chanal had already shot several pictures after fleeing from the Nazis in France.  Funding for the film came from Argentina's government, which had raised the money by taxing the box office receipts of Hollywood movies shown there.\nShechtman wrote that the process of making Buenos Aires look like Chicago occurred \"without too much difficulty\". The slums there substituted easily for the slums of Chicago, and Wright was meticulous about recreating Chicago visually, insisting that storefronts and brand names recreated on set were authentic.\nWright played Bigger because his first choice, Canada Lee, who had portrayed the character in the Broadway play, was not able to do so. Many other actors would not consider the role because they were fearful of repercussions; Wright was blacklisted in Hollywood at the time for membership in the communist party. The role of Mary required the white actress to touch a black man, so multiple actresses were unwilling to take the role. Hollywood actress Jean Wallace accepted the female lead, possibly because her career had stalled due to personal problems.\nAmerican studios refused to release the film, but independent distributor Classic Pictures picked it up after extensive editing. About 30 minutes of film had been excised as per the direction of the New York Board of Censors.\n\nRelease and later restoration\nDespite a heavy editing, multiple U.S. states made it illegal to show the new cut of the film.The Library of Congress undertook a restoration, with consultation by Edgardo Krebs of the Smithsonian Institution. In 2012, an in-progress  version of the restoration aired at the New York Film Festival. The fully restored uncut film, stitched together from a complete 16MM Argentine print and an incomplete 35MM print in the Archivo General de Puerto Rico intended for non-United States markets, premiered in the United States at the Museum of Modern Art in 2016.\n\nReception\nShechtman wrote that, in regards to the initial U.S. distribution, \"Reviewers and theatre owners were encouraged to receive it as tawdry entertainment, and most did.\" Chenal stated \"We presented a perfectly massacred version of the film and they have the right to review it.\" A review in an African American newspaper described the edited film as being similar to The Birth of a Nation; the review stated that the film was \"leaving the audience with no choice but to condemn\" Bigger due to omission of key characteristics.The 1951 review in The New York Times described the film as \"a sincere but strangely unconvincing film\". The reviewer added \"The stature of Native Son has been reduced with this exposure of film\". That same review described many of the actors as also being \"amateurish\".Media studies professor Thy Phu stated that the film was \"a commercial and critical disaster\".: 36  Film historian Aljean Harmetz wrote in The New York Times that the 1951 film was \"criticized as amateurish and melodramatic\".Film journalist Anna Shechtman wrote in The New Yorker that the \"amateurism\" in the portrayal of Bigger by Wright \"almost works\" due to the \"slow and stilted\" voice \"as though he's speaking to people in a language they don't know—which, partly, he was.\" Film critic J. Hoberman in The New York Times argued  that the attempt to age Bigger in the film does not help the portrayal and that \"Although Wright's delivery is forceful and his looks camera-friendly, he can't avoid seeming inauthentic in a T-shirt and baseball cap, playing a man half his age.\"Regarding the restored version, Chris Vogner of the Houston Chronicle stated \"Even if it's not a great film, the \"Native Son\" is of historical and cultural significance\".\n\nSee also\nStein, Sadie (2013-07-15). \"Watch Richard Wright Act in Native Son\".

It is an adaptation of the 1866 novel of the same name by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The same year a separate American film adaptation was made featuring Peter Lorre.\nThe film's sets were designed by the art director Aimé Bazin. Chenal rejected Bazin's original designs as too realistic and historically faithful, as he wished to create a more expressionist ambience for the film.\n\nCritical reception\nWriting for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a moderately good review, praising the direction and the camerawork particularly during the murder scene, the fidelity of the film to the text upon which it was based, and the acting of Pierre Blanchar in portraying Raskolnikov. Of Harry Bauer's portrayal of Porphyrius, Greene described the acting as \"a lovely performance, the finest I have seen in the cinema this year\". For Greene, the major problem with the film was that by converting it into a film in the third party instead of approaching the tale from within Raskolnikov's mind, the film was necessarily curtailed.\n\nCast\nHarry Baur as Porphyre\nPierre Blanchar as Rodion Raskolnikov\nMadeleine Ozeray as Sonia\nLucienne Le Marchand as Dounia\nMarcelle Géniat as Mme Raskolnikov\nAlexandre Rignault as Razoumikhine\nSylvie as Catherine Ivanova\nAimé Clariond as Loujine\nMagdeleine Bérubet as Aliona\nGeorges Douking as Nicolas\nMarcel Delaître as Marmeladov\nCatherine Hessling as Elisabeth\nDaniel Gilbert as Zamiatov\nPaulette Élambert as Polia\nPaul Asselin as Lieutenant Poudre\nEugène Chevalier as Le Borgne\nGeno Ferny as Commissioner's assistant\nClaire Gérard as Nastassia\nLéon Larive as Koch\nCharles Lemontier as Pestriakov\nPassage 5:\nThe Lafarge Case\nThe Lafarge Case (French: L'Affaire Lafarge) is a 1938 French historical crime film directed by Pierre Chenal and starring Pierre Renoir, Marcelle Chantal and Raymond Rouleau.

He graduated from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales) with an MA in screenwriting.\n\nCareer\nAfter directing a small-budget film called Footsteps, Evans was hired as a freelance director for a documentary about the Indonesian martial art pencak silat. He became fascinated with it, and discovered Indonesian martial artist Iko Uwais, who was working as a deliveryman for a phone company. Evans cast Uwais in his 2009 film Merantau. He planned to produce a larger action film, but scaled the production budget down and created an action film called The Raid (2011). After the success of The Raid, the larger action film eventually became the basis for its sequel, The Raid 2: Berandal (2014).In late 2016, Evans started working on his next film, Apostle, which stars Dan Stevens. The film was released by Netflix on 12 October 2018.\nIn October 2017, TheWrap reported that Evans had pitched his idea for a Deathstroke solo film and is in early talks to write and direct.

It is part of the European route E105. It is 720 kilometers long.\nInaugurated in 1950, the highway starts at the junction of the Moscow Ring Road and Varshavskoye Shosse and travels south-west, immediately bypassing the cities of Tula, Oryol, Kursk and Belgorod before terminating at the border with Ukraine. \nWest of the border at Hoptivka, the road continues through Kharkiv and Zaporizhia to Simferopol and Yalta as the Ukrainian M20 and M18. Prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation, it was used by Russian summer vacationers who travel to the Black Sea resorts of Crimea; that journey may now be made  by the M4 and A290 instead.\n\nHistory\nAt the heart of the route of the road lies the ancient Crimean tract. The highway Moscow - Kharkiv section was built in 1840–60. The road was completely renovated in 1946–50, Getting asphalt cover. The route Moscow - Kharkiv - Simferopol in the Soviet period had the number 4.\nBy the time of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, it was decided to build a high-speed road understudy. Olympic Torch Relay took place partly on the new road, despite the fact that only a part of the route in the Moscow region and the junction with the Ring Road was completed in 1980. This was the first interchange in the Soviet Union, the traffic movement on which was carried out in three levels.\n\nSee also\nBerlinka, the never-completed Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg of the Third Reich into East Prussia.\nPassage 4:\nA180 highway (Russia)\nRussian Route A180, also known as Narva Highway (Russian: Федера́льная автомоби́льная доро́га А180 «На́рва», Federal highway A180 \"Narva\") is a Russian federal highway that runs from Saint Petersburg through Ivangorod up to the border with Estonia by the Narva River, with the Estonian city of Narva on the opposite bank, which explains the name of the highway. It is part of European route E20, making its easternmost stretch.\nUp until late 2010, it was designated as М11, which is now the number of the newly planned Moscow–Saint Petersburg motorway.Since the 2000s the road has been being gradually reconstructed to have four lanes instead of two and to pass around the congested streets of Kransnoye Selo.\nThe eastern stretch of the highway adjacent to Saint Petersburg, known there as Tallinskoye Highway (Russian: Таллинское Шоссе), is a part of World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments due to its historical significance and multitude of cultural and historical monuments along its course.\nPassage 5:\nM9 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M9, also known as the Baltic Highway, is a 610 km-long trunk road that leads from Moscow through Volokolamsk to Russia's border with Latvia. The road runs north of Moscow across the towns of Krasnogorsk, Istra, Volokolamsk, Zubtsov, Rzhev, Velikiye Luki, and Sebezh, ending up at the state border. It passes Moscow, Tver, and Pskov Oblasts. The highway forms a part of the European route E22 which continues across the border to Rēzekne and Riga.In Moscow, the highway follows Zvenigorodskoe Shosse, Mnevniki Street, and Marshala Zhukova Avenue before crossing with Moscow Ring Road. The stretch between Moscow and Volokolamsk is known as Novorizhskoye Shosse. This is the only stretch (along with the part within the city of Moscow) built as a dual carriageway.\nPassage 6:\nEuropean route E411\nEuropean route E411 is a European route in Belgium and France connecting Brussels to Metz via Namur and Arlon. The E411 starts in the municipality of Auderghem alongside the Beaulieu metro station, crosses the municipality on a viaduct, then crosses the Brussels Ring and leaves Auderghem to enter Flanders in Overijse. When it leaves Overijse, the route enters Wallonia in Rixensart. It has an interchange with European route E42 near Namur and with European route E25 near Neufchâteau. At this point and up to Arlon, the two routes use the same road. In Arlon, route E411 continues to Aubange in Belgium, Longwy in France and on to Metz where it connects to the A31-E25 near Uckange.\nIn Belgium, the route E411 has the national designation A4 and name l'Autoroute des Ardennes and is roughly parallel to the N4 road.\n\nExternal links\nUN Economic Commission for Europe: Overall Map of E-road Network (2007)\nPassage 7:\nHemus motorway\nThe Hemus motorway (Bulgarian: Автомагистрала „Хемус“, Avtomagistrala \"Hemus\") or Haemus motorway, designated A2, is a partially built motorway in Bulgaria. Its planned length is 418 km, of which 191 km are in operation as of October 2022. The motorway in operation is divided into two sections — the first one links the capital Sofia with Boaza near Yablanitsa, crossing Stara planina (Balkan mountains), and the second segment connects Varna and Buhovtsi near Targovishte. According to the plans, Hemus motorway would connect Sofia with the third-largest city of Varna, at the Black Sea coast, duplicating European route E70 (Varna–Shumen), European route E772 (Shumen–Yablanitsa) and European route E83 (Yablanitsa–Sofia).\n\nHistory\nOctober 4, 1974\nThe construction of the motorway officially began. The groundbreaking ceremony was attended by the First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP), Todor Zhivkov.\n\n1999\nThe Pravets–Yablanitsa section of the Hemus motorway was officially opened on 5 December 1999. Due to the mountainous terrain through the Balkans, the 5.47 km section together with another 16 km reconstructed, features two viaducts and one tunnel (Praveshki hanove), while the whole Sofia–Yablanitsa section has three more tunnels. The construction of the Pravets–Yablanitsa section began in 1984 but ceased in the late 1980s due to lack of funds to eventually be finished in 1998–1999.\n\n2005\nThe 12.8 km section connecting Shumen with Kaspichan to the east was opened on 30 December 2005 and cost 77.6 million leva.\n\n2013\nIn July 2013 a segment of the motorway at Shumen opened.\nIn August 2013 a 8.46 km segment, connecting the Sofia ring road and the Yana junction, opened to traffic.\n\n2015\nIn August 2015, a 4.9 km segment, including the Belokopitovo interchange (with I-2 road), was inaugurated.\n\n2019\nIn October 2019, а 9.3 km segment, connecting Yablanitsa with the I-4 road near the Boaza ravine of Vit, was inaugurated.\n\n2022\nIn October 2022, а 16.3 km segment, connecting Belokopitovo with the village of Buhovtsi near Targovishte, was inaugurated.\n\nRecent Developments\nIn January 2013 National Company \"Strategic Infrastructure Projects\" (NCSIP), a state-run company, tendered feasibility study for the remaining sections of Hemus motorway (Yablanitsa-Panayot Volovo). In 2014 NCSIP signed contracts for drawing conceptual designs for all 8 lots of the motorway. In January 2015, a tender for design and build of 2 lots, between Yablanitsa and the Pleven/Lovech road, has been announced by NCSIP. In 2016 NCSIP was closed, with all activities being transferred to the Roads Agency. The tender for construction of the Yablanitsa - Pleven/Lovech road was cancelled due to lack of secured financing and later in 2016 a new tender for a shorter 9 km stretch between Yablanitsa and Boaza has been announced.\n\nExits\nMiscellaneous\nBebresh Viaduct, regarded as the highest motorway bridge in the Balkans with a clearance of 120 m, is part of the Hemus motorway.\nThe motorway is named after the Haemus Mons, an ancient name of the Balkan Mountains (Stara Planina).\n\nGallery\nPassage 8:\nM1 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route M1 (also known as the Belarus Highway, road to Minsk) is a major trunk road that runs from Moscow through Smolensk before reaching the border with Belarus. The length is 440 kilometers (270 mi). The highway runs south of Odintsovo, Kubinka, Mozhaysk, Gagarin, north of Vyazma, through Safonovo and Yartsevo. After crossing the border with Belarus, the highway continues (as olimpijka) to Minsk, Brest, and Warsaw. The entire route is part of European route E30 and AH6.\nDuring the 1980 Summer Olympics, a 50-kilometer (31 mi) stretch between the 23-kilometer (14 mi) mark and the 73-kilometer (45 mi) mark was used for the road team time trial cycling event.\nPassage 9:\nM6 highway (Russia)\nThe Russian route P22 (also known as the Caspian Highway) is a major trunk road that links Moscow to the Caspian Sea. The road runs from Stupino, then heads southeast across Ryazan Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Voronezh Oblast, and Volgograd Oblast, running along the right bank of the Volga River through Volgograd before terminating at Astrakhan. Its length is 1381 kilometers. The entire route is part of European route E119, the stretch between Volgograd and Astrakhan is also part of European route E40, and the stretch between Borisoglebsk and Saratov is also a part of European route E38. The section from Kashira to Astrakhan is part of AH8, the section from Saratov to Borisoglebsk is part of AH61, and the section from Volgograd to Astrakhan is part of AH70.

{"input": "What 1986 drama directed by Lee Doo-yong starred Lee Mi-sook?", "context": "Passage 1:\nMulberry (film)\nMulberry (Korean: 뽕; Hanja: 桑; RR: Ppong) is a 1986 South Korean erotic drama film directed by Lee Doo-yong. Based on the eponymous classic story by Na Do-hyang, the film became known for its erotic subject matter, made possible by the government's gradual relaxation of censorship and control over the film industry during the 1980s. It was part of the wave of \"Folk erotic\" films that had become popular in South Korea at this time.\n\nPlot\nAn-hyeop, a beautiful young woman, lives in a small village in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Her husband, Sam-bo, is a traveling gambler who returns home for short periods after months away. During his long absences, An-hyeop earns food, money and other goods by picking mulberry leaves (ppong in Korean) for a neighbor who raises silk-worms, and also by having sex with nearly every male in the village. Angered by An-hyeop's influence over their husbands, the village women conspire to drive her away, first by beating her, and then by convincing the village elder expel her. When the elder visits An-hyeop's home to convince her to leave, she instead wins him over to her side by seducing him. The only man An-hyeop refuses to have sex with is Sam-dol, the village servant. Frustrated and infuriated, Sam-dol retaliates by telling An-hyeop's husband about her sexual promiscuity when he returns to the village. Sam-bo, An-hyeop's husband, reacts by beating Sam-dol for his verbal abuse of his wife. As Sam-bo again leaves to gamble, An-hyeop is again left to fend for herself, gathering mulberry leaves. The film closes with a lively, humorous ode to Spring (봄 - bom) and mulberry (뽕 - ppong).\n\nCast\nLee Mi-sook as An-hyeop\nLee Dae-geun as Sam-dol\nLee Moo-jeong as Kim Sam-bo\n\nBackground\nEssentially a melodramic sex-farce, Lee Young-il, in his History of Korean Cinema (1988) points out that the film \"depicts the agony of life under Japanese rule through sexual jests.\" Min, et al. write that the film symbolically shows that, with the husband gone to work with the Independence Movement, there was not much else going on in small villages during the Japanese Occupation but sex.Mulberry was shot on location at Bossam Village, a small, traditional site in Samdong, Ulsan, which was also used in director Im Kwon-taek's Surrogate Womb (씨받이 - Ssibaji) (1986), a film which helped to bring international attention to the South Korean cinema. The Korean cinematic \"tough guy\" of the era, Lee Dae-geun played the role of the servant, Sam-dol, who is the one man in the village with whom An-hyeop will not have sex. Lee became a sex symbol through his role in the film, which caused the actor some consternation. He states that he had appeared in the film for its literary qualities. Because the erotic elements of the film upstaged the literary aspects in the public eye, he refused to appear in the first sequel, Mulberry 2 (뽕 2 - Ppong 2, 1988).\n\nAvailability\nMulberry was released on Region 3 DVD in South Korea in 2005 with English subtitles. As of December 2007, it is currently still in print.\n\nAwards\nBest Film, Best Actress (Lee Mi-sook), Best Actor (Lee Dae-keun) at 6th Korean Film Critics Association (Yongpyong) Awards\nBest Director at 22nd Korea Drama and Film Art Awards\nBest Adaptation at 24th Dae Jong Awards\nBest Actress (Lee Mi-sook) at 31st Asian Pacific Film Festival\nPresented at 10th Montreal World Film Festival\n\nLater films\nA sequel titled Mulberry 2 was released in 1988, followed by Mulberry 3 in 1992.In 2014, a contemporary adaptation titled Mulberry 2014 and featuring different characters in a similar setting was released.

Some objected to the shade of the lead actress' skin, saying that she looked too dark for a Korean. Whiteness of skin was and is still considered important among many in Korea.\nOthers scoffed that it was unlikely that all of the injustices depicted could have happened to one woman. However, it is a vivid and visually spectacular depiction of the struggles many women went through in that time period.\nThe film also polarized audiences and stirred controversy when it was shown at the East–West Center and the Fifth International Film Festival in Honolulu.\n\nSee also\nList of submissions to the 57th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\nList of South Korean submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film\nPassage 3:\nEunuch (film)\nEunuch (Korean: Naeshi) is a 1986 South Korean drama film directed by Lee Doo-yong.

One of the best-known actresses of 1980s Korean cinema, Lee's most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. She retired from film after getting married in 1987, though she still appeared on television in dramas such as How's Your Husband? (1993). Then a decade later, Lee made her comeback with an award-winning leading role in E J-yong's feature debut An Affair (1998). She has since remained active in film and television, notably in the May–December romance Solitude (2002), the Dangerous Liaisons adaptation Untold Scandal (2003), the mockumentary Actresses (2009), and the family dramas Smile, Mom (2010)\n\nCareer\nLee Mi-sook debuted in film at the age of twenty in Thoughtless Momo in 1979. By the mid-1980s she had become one of the best-known actresses of her era. Together with Lee Bo-hee and Won Mi-kyung, they dominated the screen and were referred to as the \"Troika of the 1980s.\" Her most famous films from this era include Bae Chang-ho's Whale Hunting and The Winter That Year Was Warm, Lee Doo-yong's Mulberry and Eunuch, and Kwak Ji-kyoon's Wanderer in Winter. Her early career lasted until the film Love Triangle in 1987, and then she retired from the cinema after getting married.Over ten years later, in 1998, Lee returned with a widely praised role in E J-yong's award-winning film An Affair, about a woman who falls in love with her sister's fiancé. Using this film as a springboard, she re-launched her career.In 2000, Lee was cast in the high-profile project The Legend of Gingko, which was considered to be production company Kang Je-gyu Film's followup to the successful Shiri (even though Kang himself was not directing). However the film proved to be a critical and commercial disappointment. Lee's next two films, Kiss Me Much and Oh! Lala Sisters, were also more or less ignored by audiences. In contrast, her appearances in TV dramas such as Solitude (2002) were more successful.However, 2003 was one of Lee's best years, with her highly praised role in E J-yong's Untold Scandal, a retelling of the novel Dangerous Liaisons set in the Joseon Dynasty, and her role as a single mother in Lee Eon-hee's well-received melodrama ...ing.Lee next starred in Hellcats, a 2008 romantic comedy that traces the lives and loves of three characters at different stages of womanhood. Then in 2009 Lee reunited with E J-yong in Actresses, a semi-improvisational mockumentary featuring six actresses each playing themselves.In 2011, Lee launched her own lingerie line Starit, which was sold on home shopping channels. This would've been virtually unheard of in previous years with the fashion industry's historically narrow focus on young women. But since 2008 the sophisticated and stylish image of actresses such as Lee, Choi Myung-gil and Kim Hee-ae became aspirational for middle-aged women in Korea, and brands specifically targeting women in their 40s and 50s have increased. Lee remains a favorite in editorial spreads in fashion magazines, notably a 2010 Elle Korea feature opposite pop star TOP.Lee continued to act on television, giving a vulgar, selfish, but human spin to her role as the stepmother in Cinderella's Sister, a ratings hit in 2010. 2012's Love Rain, a Yoon Seok-ho melodrama that jumps between the 1970s and the present, inked overseas distribution deals, but was unsuccessful domestically.After a judging stint on reality acting talent program Miracle Audition, Lee hosted the cable talk show Bad Scene, which featured celebrities who reveal bad or embarrassing scenes from their past.In August 2022, she left SidusHQ and signed with new agency Hunus Entertainment.\n\nLawsuit\nIn 2012, Lee was embroiled in a controversy when she was sued by her former agency, The Contents Media, after she moved to a new agency, Hoya Spotainment. The Seoul High Court ruled that Lee was guilty of breach of contract and ordered her to pay ₩120 million (US$110,604) in damages. However, The Contents Media filed an appeal, stating that the agency was owed at least double the amount. They alleged that Lee had been involved in a romantic relationship with a man 17 years her junior in 2006, whom they claimed to have paid off in millions of won to keep him from talking to the press and tarnishing Lee's image. Lee counter-sued The Contents Media and the two reporters who broke the story for defamation. Lee lost her appeal in February 2013, and the Seoul High Court ruled for her to pay the amount in the original ruling.In August 2013, she signed with another agency, SidusHQ.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 2007, Lee and her husband Hong Sung-ho, a plastic surgeon, divorced after 20 years of marriage. They have a son and a daughter.\n\nFilmography\n*Note; the whole list is referenced.\n\nTelevision series\nVariety show\nBook\nAwards\nPassage 5:\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave\nBruce Lee Fights Back from the Grave, originally released as Visitor of America (Korean: 아메리카 방문객; Hanja: 아메리카 訪問客; RR: Amelika bangmungaeg), is a 1976 Bruceploitation supernatural martial arts film starring tae kwon do instructor Jun Chong (credited as 케리・郑 Ke-li Chong in the original South Korean version and as Bruce K. L. Lea in the English-dubbed and altered U.S. edit). The film was directed by Lee Doo-yong, though persistent misinformation claims that the movie was directed by Italian horror director Umberto Lenzi.\n\nPlot overview\nThe opening sequence (which was filmed separately and added to the original South Korean film when the film was dubbed into English) shows Bruce Lee (played by an unknown imitator), leaping from his grave after it is struck by lightning. While this and the title imply a story involving Bruce Lee returning from the afterlife in order to do battle, the rest of the movie revolves around a plot that has nothing to do with Bruce Lee. Instead, it talks about a certain Wong Han, a Korean man trying to discover the truth behind the death of his brother, Han Ji-Hyeok. He travels to Los Angeles and allies himself with a woman named Suzanne. Han is harassed by a number of petty criminals and thugs in his attempt to find out the truth about his brother. Eventually, he begins to suspect that Ji-Hyeok is still alive and involved in a criminal racket.\n\nCast\nJun Chong (credited as 케리・郑 Ke-li Chong / Bruce K. L. Lea) as Wong Han\nDeborah Dutch as Susanne\nSho Kosugi as Suzuki\n\nRegional differences\nThe version of the film seen on both the U.K. and U.S. VHS and DVD comes from an American edit of an English dub that was prepared in Hong Kong.\nAlthough the film was released in South Korea in 1976, it is unknown as to whether or not the film had a release in Chinese theaters.\nThe music score for the English-language version contains music lifted from the soundtracks to Rocky and Rollercoaster, two films not released until after the South Korean release date of this film. The sound effects on this version are typical of those often found in Hong Kong martial arts films at the time, rather than the sort that were heard in South Korean films.\nThe script for the English dub makes repeated references to the Asian characters being Chinese, when the visual evidence indicates that they are Korean.\nThe U.S. distributors added the infamous \"Bruce Lee\" opening sequence.\n\nSee also\nList of Hong Kong films\nList of martial arts films\nPassage 6:\nMiss Korea (TV series)\nMiss Korea (Korean: 미스코리아) is a South Korean television series starring Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Yeon-hee, Lee Mi-sook, Lee Sung-min, Song Seon-mi, and Lee Ki-woo.

The film was partly inspired by Montesquieu's Persian Letters, as well as the 1971 film Straw Dogs, with guidance from Antonythasan Jesuthasan, who stars as the title character.\nThe film tells the story of three Tamil refugees who flee the civil war-ravaged Sri Lanka and come to France, in the hope of reconstructing their lives. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. It was later shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nPlot\nSivadhasan is a Tamil Tiger soldier during the last days of the Sri Lankan Civil War. After the armed conflict resolves, his side loses and he is forced to move to a refugee camp. There he decides to move to France to take a fresh chance at life. However, in order to secure political asylum, he requires a convincing cover story. He is given the passport of a dead man, Dheepan Natarajan, and pairs with people he barely knows posing as his family. Along with his supposed wife, Yalini and his supposed 9-year-old daughter, Illayaal, they get on a ship bound for Paris. Upon arrival, he lands a job as a resident caretaker and starts building a new life in a banlieue housing project named Le Pré. He winds up as a caretaker of a rough housing project controlled by drug dealers (filmed on location in the peaceful project of La Coudraie, in the suburban city of Poissy). The new home turns out to be another conflict zone for him. Shootouts between rival drug gangs terrify Yalini and Illayaal as they try to fit into their roles as mother and daughter. Yalini is pressured to accept a job as a nurse-maid to the father of the local drug lord. Sivadhasan attends to his duties in spite of the chaos that surrounds him but is drawn into the fight. Caught in the crossfire of a climactic gunfight, Sivadhasan's latent battle-readiness resurfaces and he single-handedly destroys an entire gang with just a handgun, a machete and a screwdriver. He rescues Yalini from her boss's blood-soaked apartment. Eventually they all manage to immigrate to England where they find real peace.\n\nCast\nAntonythasan Jesuthasan as Dheepan Natarajan/Sivadhasan\nKalieaswari Srinivasan as Yalini\nClaudine Vinasithamby as Illayaal\nVincent Rottiers as Brahim\nMarc Zinga as Youssouf\nFaouzi Bensaïdi as Mr. Habib\nBass Dhem as Azziz\nFranck Falise as Janitor of Hallway C\nJoséphine de Meaux as Headmistress\nJean-Baptiste Pouilloux as Jurist\nNathan Anthonypillai as Interpreter\nVasanth Selvam as Colonel Cheran\n\nProduction\nDirector Jacques Audiard started making the film with the intent to make a variation of Sam Peckinpah's 1971 thriller Straw Dogs.

The Independent called it \"a radical and astonishing film that turns conventional thinking about immigrants on its head\".\n\nAccolades\nThe film won the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. After winning the award, Audiard said \"To receive a prize from the Coen brothers is something pretty exceptional. I'm very touched\".

I feel Michigan has the potential to become a leader in women's athletics in the next few years, and I want to be a part of it.\"Soluk served as Michigan's women's basketball coach from 1977 to 1984. In her first four seasons as head coach, the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team did not have a winning season and compiled a 36–63 record.  In 1979 and again in 1980, some players began a movement to remove Soluk as the head coach.  During the 1980–1981 season, 11 players left the team, reportedly as the result of conflicts with Soluk.\nDuring the 1981–1982 season, the team was led by All-American Diane Dietz, who broke the Big Ten Conference scoring record.  The team compiled a 17–9 record, the best in the program's history. Dietz later recalled her time playing for Soluk as follows:\"She was here when I came in. I played against her teams a lot in high school – she was at a rival school then. But she was a Bobby Knight disciple, so it was motion offense, all the way. A lot of people weren't doing that then. She spent a lot of time with us, coaching that philosophy, and it changed the way I played, how all of us played.\"\nWith the loss of Dietz to graduation, the Michigan women's basketball team reached new lows from 1982 to 1984.  The team compiled a 4–24 record during the 1982–1983 season and followed with another poor showing (4–22) in the 1983–1984 season. After the 1983–1984 season, Soluk resigned and was replaced by Bud Van De Wege, Jr., as Michigan's women's basketball coach.  Soluk's overall record as Michigan's women's basketball coach was 66–120.\n\nSoftball\nSoluk was also the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines softball team, holding the position from 1978 to 1980. When she was hired by Michigan in 1977, it was as Michigan's women's basketball coach, and there was no softball team.

Swimming and boating are not allowed on Hog Lake.  Fishing is allowed on the pier.\nPassage 5:\nG. O. Guy\nG.O. Guy was a small chain of drugstores located in the Seattle area of the U.S. state of Washington. The chain was founded in 1888 by George Omar Guy. Throughout the early 20th century, G.O. Guy's was the second largest drug store chain in Seattle behind Bartell Drugs and predated it by two years. In 1987 Pay 'n Save purchased all six locations and converted most of them to Pay 'n Save express stores, slightly smaller than full service stores. Pay 'n Save was bought by Thrifty PayLess which in turn was bought by Rite Aid.\n\nOriginal location\nMany modern sources give the location of the first store as the H. K. Owens / Metropole Building at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, however contemporary sources indicate that Guy's first store was actually located about two blocks south, at Occidental Avenue and Main Street. For example, Guy's January 31, 1927, obituary in the Seattle Daily Times, reads:\n\nMr. Guy started his drug business at the corner of Occidental Avenue and Main Street. After the great fire a year later [i.e. in 1889], which demolished his store, he resumed business in a tent at First Avenue and Main Street and in 1893 occupied, at Second Avenue and Yesler Way, the present site of the drug company.A Times article from 1934 gives further details of the several years following the fire:\n\nGuy's first thought was for the medicines, and he saved them to establish headquarters in a first-aid tent, where he stayed until a frame building was finished at Fourth Avenue and Main Street... Later he moved to First Avenue and Main Street and, in 1893, he moved to Second Avenue and Yesler Way. There the store still stands.\n\nShootout at Second and Yesler\nThe G.O. Guy drugstore at the corner of Second Avenue and Yesler Way in Seattle was the site of an infamous shootout in 1901.Seattle police chief William L. Meredith had been fired for corruption as part of a feud with \"box house\" owner John Considine. John Considine owned the People's Theater, a \"box house,\" offering light entertainment \"such as magic acts, singing, dancing, minstrel shows,\" but also providing sexual services. Their feud had led to Meredith's resignation under pressure.Meredith, out of a job, came gunning for Considine. After Meredith got off a couple of wild shots, Considine's brother Tom Considine managed to grab a gun and use it as a club to fracture Meredith's skull; John Considine shot Meredith in the heart. The struggle lasted about 90 seconds altogether. The Considines were ultimately acquitted for the killing.\n\nLocations\nLocations included, but not limited to:\n\nSecond Avenue and Yesler Way \n725 3rd Avenue, also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Columbia \n1401 3rd Avenue in the Mann Building  also described as the corner of 3rd Avenue and Union, opposite the post office \n406 Broadway East, also described as corner Broadway and Harrison  and as 406 North Broadway \n4501 University Way \n4700 California Avenue SW \n2238 Market Street \n4002 Roosevelt Way \n518 Queen Anne Avenue \n1928 3rd Avenue, also described as corner of 3rd Avenue and Virginia Street in the Security Market Building \n1024 Madison Street \n4002 10th Ave NE at north end of University Bridge \n4727 California Avenue SW \n427 2nd Avenue South \n3600 South Village Mall \n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 6:\nBay Lake, Florida\nBay Lake is a city in Orange County, Florida, United States. The population was 29 at the 2020 census. It is named after a lake that lies east of the Magic Kingdom. All four of the Walt Disney World Resort theme parks, and one of Walt Disney World's two water parks, are in Bay Lake, though all Disney parks in the region have mailing addresses in nearby Lake Buena Vista.\nBay Lake is one of two Florida municipalities inside the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District) which also includes Walt Disney World, the other being Lake Buena Vista. The city is part of the Orlando–Kissimmee–Sanford Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\nChapter 67-1104 of the Laws of Florida, incorporating the city of Bay Lake, was signed into law by Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967, the same day he also signed chapters 67-764 (creating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, or RCID), also known as the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, and 67-1965 (incorporating the City of Reedy Creek). It was and still is located fully inside the RCID, and all its duties have been taken care of by the RCID. As fully described in Reedy Creek Improvement District, the city has always been controlled by the Walt Disney Company and has allowed them powers that other area attractions have not had.\nChapter 69-836 of the Laws of Florida, which became a law on July 3, 1969, without the governor's approval, redefined the city boundaries to exclude the easternmost part of Bay Lake. Chapter 69–1527, which became a law the same day, completely moved the city of Reedy Creek, with the land given up by Bay Lake included in the new city. Since then, Bay Lake has expanded to fill the original RCID west of Bonnet Creek, but the Reedy Creek Improvement District has expanded to include new land not in the city.\nThe RCID had all the powers of the city and more, raising the question of why cities were incorporated inside of it. Walt Disney's original plans for the site included at least one futuristic living area, a planned \"community of the future\". This was never built, but some of the ideas were incorporated into the EPCOT theme park. The later Celebration, Florida was deannexed from the city and the RCID in 1994 so the Walt Disney Company would not lose control of the district. The only residents of the city are Disney employees and their immediate family members who live in a community on the north shore of Bay Lake (on Bay Court). The only landowners are fully owned subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, rights-of-way for state and county roads, and five five-acre (2.0 ha) lots owned by senior Disney employees to give them voting power in the Reedy Creek Improvement District.\n\nGeography and climate\nBay Lake is located at 28°23′29″N 81°34′0″W (28.391502, –81.566659).According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59.1 km2), of which 21.5 square miles (55.7 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.5 km2) (5.86%) is water.The principal border that divides the cities of Lake Buena Vista to the east and Bay Lake to the west is the canal called Bonnet Creek, adjacent to Bonnet Creek Parkway. Most of the attractions associated with the Walt Disney World Resort are actually located within the City of Bay Lake, including all four theme parks.\nThe only long-term residents in Bay Lake live in a mobile home park on Bay Court, a street which, in 1987, was a dirt road. As of that year many employees wished to live in Bay Lake or Lake Buena Vista due to their proximity to their jobs.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 23 people, 9 households, and 6 families residing in the city. The population density was 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.4/km2). There were 9 housing units at an average density of 0.5 per square mile (0.2/km2). The racial makeup of the city was twenty-two whites (95.7%) and one African American (4.3%). None of the people in Bay Lake were Asian, Native American or Hispanics or Latinos.\nThere were nine households in Bay Lake, out of which three had children under the age of 18 living with them, five had married couples living together, one had a female householder with no husband present, and three of the households were non-families. Three households were made up of individuals, and one consisted of someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.00.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $86,288, and the median income for a family was $86,288. Males had a median income of $76,284 versus $21,667 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,731. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.\nBecause of Bay Lake statistics, legislators have to be careful not to use the words \"maximum\" and \"average\" in the computations used for the State of Florida's 2007 property tax reform debate.  For example, in 2006 the \"per capita levy\" of property tax in Bay Lake was $176,230.  Since the statewide average that year was $475, legislators have had to be careful to distinguish the phrase \"average savings\" from the phrase \"savings by the average taxpayer.\"In 2010 Bay Lake had a population of 47.  The racial and ethnic composition of the population was 72.3% white, 6.4% Asian, 4.3% of two or more races and 17.0% Hispanic or Latino.\n\nPoints of interest\nWalt Disney World:\nMagic Kingdom\nDisney's Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground\nMagnolia and Palm Golf Courses\nDisney's BoardWalk Resort\nEpcot\nDisney's Animal Kingdom\nDisney's Blizzard Beach\nDisney's Hollywood Studios\nESPN Wide World of Sports Complex\nDisney's Animal Kingdom Lodge\nStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\n\nGovernment and infrastructure\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District has its Fire Department Emergency Services station in Bay Lake (it has a Lake Buena Vista postal address).\n\nEducation\nResidents of Bay Lake (Bay Court) are zoned to schools in the Orange County Public Schools:\nBay Lake Elementary SchoolIt opened in 2016, relieving Horizon West area elementary schools and making it one of three schools to open that year in the county. Myrlene Kimble was the school's first principal. The 94,279-square-foot (8,758.8 m2) building, with a capacity of 837 students, is on a 15-acre (6.1 ha) property. In fall 2016 it had 785 students. Its design is similar to that of Independence Elementary School.\nBridgewater Middle School\nWindermere High SchoolFormerly it was zoned to the following:\n\nIndependence Elementary School (prior to 2016)\nWindermere Elementary School\nLakeview Middle School\nWest Orange High School (prior to 2017)\nPassage 7:\nRay's Splash Planet\nRay's Splash Planet (often referred to as Ray's) is a Mecklenburg County, North Carolina funded water park located in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. The aquatic facility is operated by the Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation department. Ray's Splash Planet is considered one of the largest indoor water parks in both of the Carolinas and is the largest water park in Charlotte, North Carolina, with over 29,000 square feet of space and using over 117,000 gallons of water at 87 degrees. The water is cleaned and sanitized through the use of chlorine, filtration and an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation system. There are multiple attractions including the Blue Comet, a three-story figure 8 slide, and other family friendly attractions like the Orbiter, Saturation Station, the Vortex, Meteor Showers, Moon Beach and the Sea of Tranquility. The water park also features a fitness center and gymnasium shared with the Irwin Academic Center, an educational center of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system. The first floor of the facility includes the pool area, locker rooms, birthday party classrooms and concessions stand. The second story includes the fitness center with an aerobics/dance studio. Access to the indoor gymnasium is also located on the second floor. Ray's Splash Planet is located on North Sycamore Street near Johnson & Wales University and is just off Interstate 77 in North Carolina in the Third Ward section of Uptown Charlotte.  The water park opened on October 15, 2002 with help from Mecklenburg County Park and Recreation's partnership with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Major competitors are Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina, Great Wolf Lodge in Concord, North Carolina and Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nHistory\nIn 1994, a plan was suggested to turn the Irwin Avenue Elementary School into a new recreation center. Extensive renovation of the gymnasium followed the approval of a 1995 park bond referendum, and the (basketball) gymnasium opened to the public in 1998 as the Irwin Avenue Recreation Center. The referendum also allowed for design for one of the first indoor water parks in the Southeast. Land for the water park was available on the Irwin Elementary campus, adjacent to a natural creek that is park of the Mecklenburg County greenway system and that connects surrounding neighborhoods. The architect firm Clark/Nexsen designed the water park facilities, emphasizing the movement of water and incorporating the nearby natural creek as its design. The $7.5 million project had its groundbreaking in March 2001. Physically attached to the Irwin Academic Center (previously known as Irwin Avenue Elementary) through the shared space of the gymnasium, Ray's Splash Planet opened on October 15, 2002. Since 2002, Ray's Splash Planet has won numerous awards and accolades for being a feature attraction for local residents from the Charlotte Observer newspaper, Creative Loafing and Charlotte Parent magazines.\n\nRides and attractions\nSee also\nList of waterparks\nPassage 8:\nAshland/63rd station\nAshland/63rd is an 'L' station and the terminal of the CTA Green Line's Ashland branch, located in the West Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Situating at 6315 S. Ashland Avenue, the station contains a Park 'n' ride lot with 235 spaces as well as a Kiss 'n' Ride lane. This is one of two stations on the Green Line to be named Ashland. The other station is on the Lake Street branch and is shared between the Green and Pink Lines. The Red Line served this station from May 19, 2013 to October 20, 2013, April 3, 2017 to November 22, 2017, and July 30, 2018 to April 26, 2019.\n\nHistory\nLoomis\nLoomis was a station on the Englewood branch of the Chicago \"L\". Although other stations on the Englewood branch opened in stages, the station opened on July 13, 1907, concluding overall construction of the branch. Despite improvements to the station, it was closed in 1969 when the new Ashland/63rd station opened two blocks west.\n\nAshland/63rd\nThe Ashland/63rd station opened on May 6, 1969 to replace the Loomis station. Though the station itself was not rebuilt during the course of the Green Line renovation in 1994-96, an elevator was added to the station to make it accessible to passengers with disabilities.\n\nBus connections\nCTA\n\n 9 Ashland (Owl Service) \n X9 Ashland Express (Weekday Rush Hours only) \n 63 63rd  (Owl Service)\n\nImage gallery\nSee also\nAshland (CTA Green and Pink Lines station)\nAshland (CTA Orange Line station)\nAshland Yard\nPassage 9:\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe\nWet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe (often simply referred to as Wet 'n Wild or Emerald Pointe) is a water park located in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States, and part of the Wet 'n Wild chain. There are 40 rides and attractions, including 5 pools, 2 children's areas, and one of the largest wave pools in the country. The Themed Entertainment Association has ranked the park 20th in North America in terms of attendance, of which they had 407,000 visitors as of 2015. Major regional competitors are Carowinds' Carolina Harbor in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dollywood's Splash Waterpark in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nHistory\nOriginally named Aqua Gardens, the park opened in September 1983. From 1984 to 1986, it used the name Water Country USA. In 1986, it was purchased by a local company and renamed Emerald Pointe. In March 1999 Ogden Corp purchased the property, along with Raging Waters and Wet 'n Wild's assets, and renamed the park Wet 'n Wild Emerald Pointe. In 2019, the newest attraction \"Bombs Away\" was revealed at the end of the season to the public and was originally slated to open for the 2020 season. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, it has been delayed to open for the 2022 Season.\n\nRides and attractions\nCurrent attractions\nFormer attractions\nSee also\nWet 'n Wild (brand)\nPassage 10:\nHat 'n' Boots\nHat 'n' Boots is a roadside attraction and landmark in the Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.

Also commonly known as black fruit wolfberry, siyah goji, and kaokee, it is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family which can be found in Central Asia, southern part of Russia, throughout Northwest China, Northern India and Pakistan.\n\nDescription\nThe species is either 1.8 centimetres (0.71 in), 20–50 centimetres (7.9–19.7 in), 20–150 centimetres (7.9–59.1 in), or 180 centimetres (71 in) tall. The leaves are either 5–30 millimetres (0.20–1.18 in), 0.6–2.5 centimetres (0.24–0.98 in), or 6–25 millimetres (0.24–0.98 in) by 1–1.5 millimetres (0.039–0.059 in). It have 2-4 sepals each one of which is bell-shaped and 3–4 millimetres (0.12–0.16 in) long. Pedicels are either 5–10 millimetres (0.20–0.39 in) long or can be as long as it sepals. The calyx is 2.5–3.5 millimetres (0.098–0.138 in) long but can be companulate and exceed 4–5 millimetres (0.16–0.20 in). Corolla's tube is 5–7 millimetres (0.20–0.28 in) long with stamens have 5–8 millimetres (0.20–0.31 in) long berries (which can sometimes grow up to 9 millimetres (0.35 in)) which are also broad and globose. The fruits' seeds are brown coloured and are 1.5–2 millimetres (0.059–0.079 in) long. The flowering time is June to August but can sometimes bloom in May too. Fruits mature from August to October.\n\nDistribution and uses\nIn India, it grows in Nubra Valley where it is used by native people to cure blindness in camels. In Central Asia and Northwest China the species grows on elevation of 400–3,000 metres (1,300–9,800 ft) in saline deserts, sands and roadsides.\nPassage 2:\nCrocosmia aurea\nCrocosmia aurea, common names falling stars, Valentine flower, or montbretia, is a perennial  flowering plant belonging to the family Iridaceae.\n\nEtymology\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, \nmeaning \"odor\", as dried leaves of these plants, when immersed in hot water, emit a strong smell similar to saffron. The species Latin name aurea, meaning “golden”, refers to the bright colour of the flowers.\n\nDescription\nCrocosmia aurea reaches on average 120 centimetres (47 in) in height. It grows from basal underground corms with long stolons. The basal, alternate leaves are cauline, linear, with a distinct midvein and entire margins, about 20–30 millimetres (0.79–1.18 in) wide. At the end of the flower stalk they have colourful branched inflorescences of bright orange to red flowers, reaching on average 40 millimetres (1.6 in) in diameter. The flowering period extends from June through August. The fruit is a capsule, with small blackish and round seeds. The plant can also be propagated by dividing the clumps of corms, fleshy underground stems similar to bulbs.\n\nDistribution\nCrocosmia aurea is widely distributed in southern and eastern Africa, from South Africa to Sudan. In South Africa it is common in the grasslands of the Cape Floristic Region.\n\nHabitat\nUsually these plants live in large colonies in shady forests and in banks of the rivers. They prefer moist habitats, at an altitude of 0–2,000 metres (0–6,562 ft) above sea level..\n\nGallery\nPassage 3:\nCrocosmia\nCrocosmia (;), also known as montbretia (), is a small genus of flowering plants in the iris family, Iridaceae. It is native to the grasslands of southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan. One species is endemic to Madagascar.\n\nDescription\nThey can be evergreen or deciduous perennials that grow from basal underground corms. The alternate leaves are cauline and ensiform (sword shaped). The blades are parallel-veined. The margin is entire. The corms form in vertical chains with the youngest at the top and oldest and largest buried most deeply in the soil. The roots of the lowermost corm in a chain are contractile roots and drag the corm deeper into the ground where conditions allow. The chains of corms are fragile and easily separated, a quality that has enabled some species to become invasive and difficult to control in the garden.\nThey have colourful inflorescences of 4 to 20 vivid red and orange subopposite flowers on a divaricately (horizontally) branched stem. The terminal inflorescence can have the form of a cyme or a raceme. These flower from early summer well into fall. The flowers are sessile on a flexuose arched spike. The fertile flowers are hermaphroditic. All stamens have an equal length. The style branches are apically forked. They are pollinated by insects, birds (sunbirds) or by the wind. The dehiscent capsules are shorter than they are wide.\nThe genus name is derived from the Greek words krokos, meaning \"saffron\", and osme, meaning \"odor\" – from the dried leaves emitting a strong smell like that of saffron (a spice derived from Crocus – another genus belonging to the Iridaceae) – when immersed in hot water.The alternative name montbretia is still widely used, especially for the garden hybrid C. × crocosmiiflora.  \"Montbretia\" commonly used in the British Isles for orange-flowered C. × crocosmiiflora cultivars that have naturalised, while \"crocosmia\" is reserved for less aggressive red-flowered cultivars.  Montebretia is a heterotypic synonym of the genus Tritonia in which some species of Crocosmia were once included.  It was named by Alire Raffeneau Delile for Ernest Coquebert de Montbret, a fellow French botanist on Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign.\n\nSpecies\nSpecies accepted by World Checklist of Selected Plant Families\nCrocosmia ambongensis (H.Perrier) Goldblatt & J.

It has 27 pairs of chromosomes. A perennial flowering plant, it has leaves between 3–5 cm in length and flower heads that are 3–4.5 cm with white petals. Typically, flowering occurs in October to December annually. It the floral emblem of Hyōgo Prefecture.\n\nDistribution\nCurrently it is classified as semi-endangered. Native only in Japan. It is naturally found in Shikoku (coastal area of Kochi prefecture and Ehime prefecture).\n\nIndustrial uses\nIt is used in the manufacture of nojigiku alcohol.\nPassage 5:\nWolffia arrhiza\nWolffia arrhiza is a species of flowering plant known by the common names spotless watermeal and rootless duckweed, belonging to the Araceae, a family rich in water-loving species, such as Arum and Pistia. It is the smallest vascular plant on Earth. It is native to Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, and it is present in other parts of the world as a naturalized species.\n\nDescription\nWolffia arrhiza is an aquatic plant which grows in quiet water bodies such as ponds. The green part of the plant, the frond, is a sphere measuring about 1 mm wide, but with a flat top that floats at the water's surface. It has a few parallel rows of stomata. There is no root. The plant produces a minute flower fully equipped with one stamen and one pistil. It often multiplies by vegetative reproduction, however, with the rounded part budding off into a new individual. In cooler conditions the plant becomes dormant and sinks to the bed of the water body to overwinter as a turion. The plant is a mixotroph which can produce its own energy by photosynthesis or absorb it from the environment in the form of dissolved carbon.\n\nHuman uses\nThis tiny plant is a nutritious food. Its green part is about 40% protein by dry weight and its turion is about 40% starch. It contains many amino acids important to the human diet, relatively large amounts of dietary minerals and trace elements such as calcium, magnesium, and zinc, and vitamin B12. It has long been used as a cheap food source in Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, where it is known as khai-nam (\"eggs of the water\").  The plant is prolific in its reproduction, growing in floating mats that can be harvested every 3 to 4 days; it has been shown to double its population in less than four days in vitro.It is also useful as a form of agricultural and municipal water treatment. It is placed in effluent from black tiger shrimp farms to absorb and metabolize pollutants. The plants grow quickly and take up large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. The plants that grow in the wastewater can then be used as feed for animals, such as carp, Nile tilapia, and chickens.\nPassage 6:\nActaea racemosa\nActaea racemosa, the black cohosh, black bugbane, black snakeroot, rattle-top, or fairy candle (syn. Cimicifuga racemosa), is a species of flowering plant of the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to eastern North America from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas. It grows in a variety of woodland habitats, and is often found in small woodland openings. The roots and rhizomes were used in traditional medicine by Native Americans. Its extracts are manufactured as herbal medicines or dietary supplements. Most dietary supplements containing black cohosh are not well-studied or recommended for safe and effective use in treating menopause symptoms or any disease. In contrast, some herbal medicinal products containing black cohosh extract hold a marketing authorization in several states of the European Union and are well-studied and recommended for safe and effective use for the relief of menopausal symptoms (i.e. in the years around menopause) such as hot flushes and profuse sweating attacks. Such differentiation between the product types seems to be important.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe plant species has a history of taxonomic uncertainty. Carl Linnaeus, on the basis of morphological characteristics of the inflorescence and seeds, placed the species into the genus Actaea. This designation was later revised by Thomas Nuttall reclassifying the species to the genus Cimicifuga. Nuttall's classification was based solely on the dry follicles produced by black cohosh, which are typical of species in Cimicifuga. However, recent data from morphological and gene phylogeny analyses demonstrate that black cohosh is more closely related to species of the genus Actaea than to other Cimicifuga species. This has prompted the revision to Actaea racemosa as originally proposed by Linnaeus. Blue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides), despite its similar common name belongs to another family, the Berberidaceae, is not closely related to black cohosh, and may be unsafe if used together.\n\nDescription\nBlack cohosh is a smooth (glabrous) herbaceous perennial plant that produces large, compound leaves from an underground rhizome, reaching a height of 25–60 cm (9.8–23.6 in). The basal leaves are up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long and broad, forming repeated sets of three leaflets (tripinnately compound) having a coarsely toothed (serrated) margin.\nThe flowers are produced in late spring and early summer on a tall stem, 75–250 cm (30–98 in) tall, forming racemes up to 50 cm (20 in) long. The flowers have no petals or sepals, and consist of tight clusters of 55–110 white, 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long stamens surrounding a white stigma. The flowers have a distinctly sweet, fetid smell that attracts flies, gnats, and beetles.The fruit is a dry follicle 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) long, with one carpel, containing several seeds.\n\nCultivation\nA. racemosa grows in dependably moist, fairly heavy soil. It bears tall tapering racemes of white midsummer flowers on wiry black-purple stems, whose mildly unpleasant, medicinal smell at close range gives it the common name \"Bugbane\". The drying seed heads stay handsome in the garden for many weeks. Its deeply cut, superficially maple-like leaves, burgundy colored in the variety \"atropurpurea\", add interest to gardens, wherever summer heat and drought do not make it die back, which make it a popular garden perennial. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.The plant was Virginia Native Plant Society’s 2017 wildflower of the year.\n\nTraditional medicine\nHistory\nNative Americans used black cohosh in the belief it could treat gynecological and other disorders. Following the arrival of European settlers in the U.S. who continued the use of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia under the name \"black snakeroot\". In the 19th century, the root was used to treat snakebite, inflamed lungs, and pain from childbirth.\n\nHerbalism\nExtracts from the underground parts of the plant — the rhizome (Cimicifugae racemosae rhizoma) and the root (Cimicifugae racemosae radix) — are used in herbal medicine. The rhizomes and roots contain various saponins (triterpene saponins and triterpene glycosides, such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids.In most European countries, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Argentina and some other countries, black cohosh products are available as herbal products which have been approved by regulatory authorities ensuring reliable pharmaceutical quality, safety and efficacy for the relief of menopausal complaints such as hot flushes and profuse sweating. In the U.S., India, and some other countries, black cohosh is used as a dietary supplement marketed mainly to women for treating menopausal symptoms and other gynecological problems. Meta-analyses of contemporary evidence support these claims on menopausal complaints only for products holding a marketing authorization for this indication, whereas there is no high-quality scientific evidence to support such uses for other products.\n\nSafety concerns\nThe Herbal Medicinal Product Committee (HMPC) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has summarized the adverse drug reactions of herbal medicines made from cimicifuga with mentioning allergic skin reactions (urticaria, itching, exanthema), facial oedema and peripheral oedema, and gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. dyspeptic disorders, diarrhoea).Studies on the long-term safety of using herbal medicines made from black cohosh are available. They do not show harmful effects on breast tissue, endometrium, or breast cancer survivors. In contrast, such studies have not been published for dietary supplements made from black cohosh. Most black cohosh materials are harvested from the wild. Lack of proper authentication and adulteration of commercial preparations by other plant species are risk factors in dietary supplements and a critical matter of quality control in herbal medicinal products holding a marketing authorization. Very high doses of black cohosh may cause nausea, dizziness, visual effects, a lower heart rate, and increased perspiration.Worldwide, some 83 cases of liver damage, including hepatitis, liver failure, and elevated liver enzymes, have been associated with using black cohosh, although a cause-and-effect relationship remains undefined. Millions of women have taken black cohosh without reporting adverse health effects, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials found no evidence that black cohosh preparations had adverse effects on liver function. Package leaflets of phytomedicines made from black cohosh caution that people with liver problems should not take it, although a 2011 meta-analysis of research evidence suggested this concern may be unfounded. In 2007, the Australian Government warned that black cohosh may cause liver damage, although rarely, and should not be used without medical supervision. Other studies concluded that liver damage from use of black cohosh is unlikely. The clinical picture is similar to an autoimmune hepatitis with centrilobular liver cell necrosis, which can be treated with corticosteroids.\n\nPhytochemicals and pharmacology\nThe rhizomes and roots of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa rhizoma) contain diverse phytochemicals, particularly various saponins (triterpene saponins/triterpene glycosides such as actein) as well as cimifugic acids and other phenol carboxylic acids. The pharmacologically active substance comprises the total extract. In the past, estrogen-like properties were attributed to preparations from this herbal drug. However, formonetin—a phytoestrogen compound (isoflavone)—could only be detected in methanolic extracts and was not found in ethanolic or isopropanolic cimicifuga extracts. Today, an estrogen-like mechanism of action can be ruled out. Regarding the alleviation of menopausal symptoms, central nervous activity was suspected as early as 2003, and it has since been confirmed with preclinical and clinical data.\n\nSee also\nCaffeic acid\nFerulic acid\nList of unproven and disproven cancer treatments\nPhenylpropanoids\nTriterpenoids\nPassage 7:\nCrocosmia paniculata\nCrocosmia paniculata is a bulbous flowering plant that is native to eastern South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini, growing in wet areas by streams, marshes, and drainages. Plants reach 4 to 5 ft (1.2–1.5 m) tall, with lanceolate leaves and deep orange to orange-brown flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant.The plant has escape cultivation and become established in the wild in parts of the United Kingdom.The common name Aunt Eliza is derived from the former generic name Antholyza.In Lesotho, where it is native, the plant is used by the indigenous Sotho people as an antidiarrhoeal remedy, administered not only to humans, but also to cattle so afflicted.\nPassage 8:\nCimicifuga\nCimicifuga (bugbane or cohosh) was a genus of between 12 and 18 species of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe genus is now generally included in Actaea.The name Cimicifuga means 'bedbug repeller'.\n\nSelected species\nCimicifuga americana\nCimicifuga arizonica\nCimicifuga biternata\nCimicifuga brachycarpa\nCimicifuga dahurica - Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: 升麻; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga elata\nCimicifuga europaea\nCimicifuga foetida\nCimicifuga heracleifolia - both used in TCM as Sheng ma in Chinese (Chinese: 升麻; pinyin: Sheng ma)\nCimicifuga japonica\nCimicifuga laciniata\nCimicifuga nanchuanensis\nCimicifuga racemosa\nCimicifuga rubifolia\nCimicifuga simplex\nCimicifuga yunnanensis\n\nIn pharmacology\nCimicifugae rhizoma - pharmacological term in herbal medicine (Cimicifuga/Actea root), translated as Sheng ma, Chinese herb\nPassage 9:\nActaea arizonica\nActaea arizonica is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name Arizona bugbane. It is endemic to Arizona in the United States, where it occurs in Coconino, Gila, and Yavapai Counties. Like some other species in genus Actaea, this plant was formerly included in the genus Cimicifuga.This rhizomatous perennial herb produces hairless stems up to 1.5 to 2 meters tall. The leaves are each made up of triple-lobed, toothed leaflets up to 17.5 centimeters long by 12.5 wide. They are borne on long petioles up to 35 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a panicle with several long branches, growing erect or leaning. The flowers have five sepals, two of which are greenish and three of which are cream in color. There are sometimes white petals as well, but these are often absent. Flowering occurs in July and August. There are many stamens in each flower. The flowers are pollinated by three species of bumblebee, Bombus occidentalis, Bombus morrisoni, and Bombus huntii. If the flowers are not pollinated by insects, or if pollination is prevented, for example, by a heavy rain, the flowers undergo abortion. The fruit is a follicle that has \"a bottle-brush appearance,\" and \"the seeds resemble furry little bugs.\"This plant is endemic to central Arizona, where it grows in the ecotone between coniferous forest and the riparian zone. The elevation is about 5300–7000 feet. Some plants grow in canyons and some grow in very moist habitat such as seeps and springs on mountain slopes. The soils are rich with humus and are well-shaded. The type locality is Bill Williams Mountain in Coconino County. It shares its habitat with the Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida).\nPassage 10:\nActaea elata\nActaea elata (syn. Cimicifuga elata) is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family known by the common name tall bugbane. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it can be found in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon.\n\nDescription\nThis species is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial reaching a maximum height around 1.8 meters. It is hairy in texture, with some glandular hairs. The leaves are made up of many lobed, toothed leaflets which resemble maple leaves in shape. The inflorescence is a branching panicle up to 17 centimeters long. The panicle bears many flowers, each with five white or pink-tinged sepals, but no petals. The flower presents a spray of long white stamens. Blooming occurs from May or June to August. The fruit is a flattened follicle up to 1.2 centimeters long. The fruits are poisonous. The plant has an unpleasant scent.\n\nHabitat\nThis species grows in moist woods and forest habitat. It is mostly restricted to lower elevations and is more common on north-facing slopes. It is associated with the forest trees Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), red alder (Alnus rubra), and vine maple (Acer circinatum), and other forest plants such as oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor), hazelnut (Corylus cornuta), sword fern (Polystichum munitum), and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus). Alpine enchanter's nightshade (Circaea alpina), herb robert (Geranium robertianum), and wall lettuce (Lactuca muralis) are indicator species for the plant, often growing alongside it. This species can dominate the forest understory where it is common. The plant may be found in old-growth forests. It prefers the shade of dense forests. It can tolerate some breaks in the canopy but not large-scale clearing, such as clearcutting. Some penetrating sunlight is beneficial for the plant during its reproductive season. Animals associated with the species include the mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), particularly in Canada. Depending on location, pollinators of the plant include bumblebees, other types of bees, beetles, and syrphid flies.\n\nDistribution\nThis species has a limited distribution in its range. Most occurrences are in southern Oregon, where the populations can be large. There are fewer occurrences in Washington. In British Columbia, the plant is only known from the far southern regions of the province, near the Chilliwack River. It is considered an endangered species in British Columbia. There are ten known populations in British Columbia, making up less than 5% of the global population of the plant.In 2004 a new variety of the species was named and defined, var. alpestris. This variety is endemic to southern Oregon and it differs from other members of its species by having scales along the lower stem, and often more pistils. It may also be found at higher elevations.Threats to this species include processes that threaten its home ecosystems, such as the old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. Fire suppression, logging, road maintenance, and other forest disturbance, collection from the wild, and damage to pollinator populations can harm occurrences of the plant.", "answers": ["Crocosmia"], "length": 3863, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b55bff6ef6f22a2c6dee6ff372eca9a460934b1b09868ee9"}

His father was the eldest son of Lord George Cavendish (later created, in 1831, the 1st Earl of Burlington, by the second creation), third son of the 4th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Charlotte Boyle, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork. His mother was the daughter of the 1st Baron Lismore.\nHe was educated at Eton and the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), attaining the position of Second Wrangler and the Smith's Prize for mathematics. He became known by the courtesy title Lord Cavendish of Keighley in 1831 when the earldom of Burlington was revived in favour of his grandfather.\n\nCareer\nCavendish was returned to parliament as the MP for Cambridge University in 1829, a seat he held until July 1831, when he was returned for Malton. He only sat for Malton until September of the same year and was out of the House of Commons until 1832, when he was returned for North Derbyshire. He succeeded his grandfather in the earldom of Burlington in 1834 and entered the House of Lords. In 1858, he also succeeded his cousin as Duke of Devonshire. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1857 to 1891 and Lord-Lieutenant of Derbyshire from 1858 to 1891.Devonshire was Chancellor of the University of London from 1836 to 1856, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1861 to 1891, and Chancellor of the Victoria University from 1880 to 1891. At Cambridge he endowed the Cavendish Professorship of Physics, and the building of the Cavendish Laboratory. He made vast (and ultimately unsuccessful) investments in heavy industry at Barrow-in-Furness, and had his nearby country house Holker Hall rebuilt in its present form after it was gutted by a fire in 1871. He was one of the original founders of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1839, and was president in 1870. On 26 July 1871, he was nominated a trustee of the British Museum.The 7th Duke inherited a considerable amount of property in Eastbourne from his grandfather, and from his wife Elizabeth Compton of Compton Place. He saw through the development of Eastbourne in the 19th century with its parks, baths and squares and is commemorated by a statue at the top of Devonshire Place. The Duke also played a part in the foundation of Eastbourne College, the local private school, by selling some of his land at a modest price to build the school on and commissioning respected architect Henry Currey to design the school chapel and College House (now the School House, a boarding facility).\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1829, Devonshire married Blanche Georgiana Howard (1812–1840), daughter of George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle, and the former Lady Georgiana Cavendish, sister of the 6th Duke of Devonshire, known as the \"Bachelor Duke\".  Blanche was the Bachelor Duke's favourite niece, and his fondness for the young couple who were his heirs may have contributed to his decision not to marry himself. He commemorated Blanche with an inscription in the Painted Hall at Chatsworth, which states that he completed his reconstruction of the house in the year of his bereavement, 1840, and by Blanche's Urn at the top of the Long Walk in the garden. Together, Blanche and William were the parents of five children:\n\nWilliam Cavendish, Lord Cavendish of Keighley (1831–1834), who died 6 days after the death of his great-grandfather\nSpencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire (1833–1908), who married Countess Louisa von Alten on 16 August 1892.\nLady Louisa Caroline Cavendish (1835–1907), who married Adm.

In 1920, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. He also took an interest in social matters, and began voluntary work at Toynbee Hall in the East End of London and joined the Labour Party in the early 1920s.At the 1929 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for South East Essex. With the formation of the Second Labour Government he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson. Thomson was killed when the R101 airship crashed on its maiden voyage in October 1930, and Oldfield returned to the backbenches.\nWith the formation of a National Government in August 1931, the parliamentary Labour Party was divided into two factions, with supporters of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald forming the National Labour Organisation and the remaining MPs moving to the opposition benches. Oldfield chose to join the latter group, and when a general election was held in October 1931, was defeated along with most of his Labour colleagues. He attempted to regain the seat in 1935 without success.Earlier in 1931, Oldfield had been elected to the London County Council to represent Whitechapel and St George's. He remained a member of the council until 1958, later representing Stepney and was vice chairman in 1954–1955.With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Oldfield attempted to rejoin the armed forces, but was initially rejected due to his age. He eventually succeeded in enlisting as an able seaman in the Royal Navy. He finished the war with the rank of sub-lieutenant.In 1953, he married Jonnet Elizabeth Richards, and the couple moved to Doddington, Kent. There he created a mushroom farm while his wife worked on the gardens of Doddington Place. In 1964, he joined the Conservative Party and was elected to Kent County Council in the following year. He remained on the council until 1981.He died in Doddington aged 100 in December 1999, 68 years after leaving the House of Commons.

A steam George V class railway engine was named in his honour by the LNWR.\nPassage 9:\nDevonshire Club\nThe Devonshire Club was a London gentlemen's club which was established in 1874 and was disbanded in 1976. Throughout its existence it was based at 50 St James's Street. The major Liberal club of the day was the Reform Club, but in the wake of the 1868 Reform Act's extension of the franchise, the waiting list for membership from the larger electorate grew to such an extent that a new club was formed to accommodate these new Liberal voters. The clubhouse was on the western side of St James's Street. The original intention was to call it the 'Junior Reform Club', along the model of the Junior Carlton Club formed in 1866, but complaints from the Reform Club's members led it to being named the Devonshire, in honour of its first chairman, the Duke of Devonshire, an aristocrat from a long line of Liberals.\nThe club was fortunate in obtaining the St James's Street premises of Crockford's Club, a renowned eighteenth century club which had closed down in 1845. The Devonshire did well in its first decade, but found itself in an awkward position from the 1880s upon the establishment of the National Liberal Club. With a further extension of the franchise in 1885, the much larger National Liberal was aimed at these new electors, and the Devonshire came to possess neither the prestige of Brooks's or the Reform, nor the broader appeal of the National Liberal. The Devonshire soon lost its political flavour.\nIn the 1960s the Golfers Club shared the premises using a club room at the back of the building and there was also a Masonic temple on site, catering for those lodges without premises.\nAfter a great deal of financial trouble in the 1970s (mirrored in many other clubs of the time, including the Reform, the Carlton, the St James's, the United University, the Junior Carlton, the Army and Navy, and the United Service Club), it finally closed in 1976, with its membership being absorbed by the East India Club.\n\nFurther reading\nHenry Turner Waddy, The Devonshire Club and Crockford's (E.

{"input": "What is the capitol of the district that also includes the village of Shienga?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBenicia Capitol State Historic Park\nBenicia Capitol State Historic Park is a state park in Benicia, California. The park is dedicated to California’s third capitol building, where the California State Legislature convened from February 3, 1853 to February 24, 1854, when they voted to move the state capital to Sacramento. It is the only pre-Sacramento capitol that remains. The park includes the Fischer-Hanlon House, an early Benicia building that was moved to the property and converted into a home in 1858, after the legislature departed. Benicia Capitol State Historic Park just off the city's main street also includes a carriage house, workers' quarters and sculptured gardens.\n\nHistory\nFollowing large complaints by state legislators of inadequate furniture and sleeping quarters in Vallejo, California in early 1853, the Legislature, with the consent of Governor John Bigler, relocated the state capital to nearby Benicia that same year. The Legislature would convene in the Benicia City Hall for a little more than a year, when again complaints over poor weather conditions, inadequate and uncomfortable sleeping quarters, and \"the insecure condition of the public archives\" arose in January 1854.\nAfter a proposal by Sacramento to use the Sacramento County Courthouse free of charge as a capital building, the Assembly and Senate passed an enabling act, voiding all previous legislation, to move the state capital to its new location upriver in Sacramento. On February 25, 1854, Governor Bigler signed the act into law, moving the capital to its current location. The Legislature and governor climbed aboard the steamship Wilson G. Hunt to take up its new quarters. \"So much opposed to the removal were the good people of Benicia,\" the Sacramento Union reported, \"that the owners of the wharves, it is stated, refused to permit the steamer ... to land to take on the legislative furniture, unless she would pay $500.\" This request was refused and the furniture was shipped from a different wharf.The Greek Revival-Palladian building was listed as a California State Historic Landmark on January 11, 1935. The National Register of Historic Places placed the Benicia capitol on the federal list on February 12, 1971.\n\nPresent day\nThe original building has been restored with reconstructed period furnishings and exhibits. The interior includes a reconstruction of the building's original floor with ponderosa pine. The desks, four of which are from the 1850s or earlier, are furnished with a candlestick, a 19th-century newspaper, a quill pen, blotting sand, a spitoon, and a top hat.\n\nThe historic park is located at 115 West G Street in Benicia, a city in the northern San Francisco Bay Area between San Pablo Bay and Suisun Bay.\nOn February 16, 2000, the California State Legislature met in the old Capitol in a symbolic session to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Legislature's first meeting.\n\nProposed for closure\nThe Benicia Capitol State Historic Park was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program, since rescinded following public outcry. It also was placed on the Governor's list of two hundred parks to close in fall of 2009 in response to the ongoing budget crisis and was on Jerry Brown's 2011 list of 70 proposed state park closures in the continuing budget crises.In March 2013, then-Director of California Department of Parks and Recreation, Anthony L.

The film's script was written by Michon with her husband W. Bruce Cameron. It is based on her 2004 novel The Grrl Genius Guide to Sex (With Other People), which was partially based on her life. Muffin Top was Michon's second directorial effort, after 2007's Cook Off!, though that film would not be released until 2017. The film stars Michon as a woman who must re-enter the dating world after her husband (played by Diedrich Bader) leaves her for a younger woman. It had its world debut on October 18, 2014 at the Carmel International Film Festival. Distribution for the film was handled by the on-demand movie distribution website Tugg, which allowed Michon to show her film in areas with high enough demand. Muffin Top was also released via VOD.\n\nPlot\nSuzanne (Cathryn Michon) is a professor of Women's Studies Pop Culture at Malibu University. On her birthday her husband Michael (Diedrich Bader) surprises her by saying that he's divorcing her in favor of his co-worker Jessica (Haylie Duff), prompting her to go on a quest to find herself.\n\nCast\nCathryn Michon as Suzanne Nicholson\nMarissa Jaret Winokur as Elise\nDiedrich Bader as Michael Nicholson\nJill Holden as Dr. Nadja Borman\nHaylie Duff as Jessica\nJane Morris as Dr. Khalsa\nWayne Federman as Hayes Greenberg\nMichael Hawley as Jarod\nDot-Marie Jones as Christina\nCristine Rose as Deborah\nMelissa Peterman as Kim\nMichael Halpi as Barnaby\nGary Anthony Williams as Gregory David Gregory\nVictoria Bohush as Andrea\nDominique Dorian as Sophie\nDavid Arquette as Cameron Scott\nMeredith Scott Lynn as Katey\nTucker as BooBoo\n\nProduction\nFilming for Muffin Top took place in Hollywood, California over a four-week period with a budget of under $1 million. While choosing the film's music Michon decided to only use music composed by female performers and she has billed Muffin Top as the \"first rom-com to have an all-female soundtrack and score\" and as a \"body image romantic comedy\".\n\nReception\nCritical reception has been mixed. The Oakland Press wrote a favorable review for Muffin Top, stating that \"most readers have probably never heard of this movie, which I think is a shame.\" The Windy City Times commented upon the film's central focus on women, which they felt was \"one of the reasons The Babadook and why actor-writer-director Cathryn Michon's comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story are such refreshing finds.\"The Star Tribune wrote a mixed review, criticizing it for utilizing vignettes while also encouraging viewers to support the flawed lead heroine while laughing at her unbearable dates. However they also stated that while the film did not match up to female oriented films like Bridesmaids, it was also \"tolerably funny\" and deserved a B for effort. A reviewer for Chicagoist panned Muffin Top and included it in their \"worst of the year\" list, writing \"Made with obvious good intentions, the indie comedy Muffin Top: A Love Story has little else going for it. Its basic plea for women to not allow their self-esteem to be damaged by unrealistic, media-enforced notions of an ideal body is a welcome message. Unfortunately, it is delivered via a frequently irritating and laugh-free feature made almost bearable by some talented cast members.\"", "answers": ["My Boss, My Hero"], "length": 3547, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5938b467f1d6ee64c2bed583d2b845f3bc1a3ea06f8d4a5a"}

James Kennedy) as being the orchestrators of perpetual, institutionalized homophobia.

Their style is characterized by prominent usage of orchestral arrangements, black (sometimes death) metal vocals, and guitar riffs. Their studio albums are concept albums with lyrics based on ghost stories and folklore, such as the Flying Dutchman. The band sets itself apart from other symphonic black metal artists with the usage of multiple languages such as English, French, German, and Dutch. Most songs are based on English, with transitions into other languages during chorus and bridge sections.\nDrummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers quit the group in February 2020, leaving the band with two current members, singer Seregor and keyboardist Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers.\n\nName\nThe name \"Carach Angren\" is derived from J. R. R. Tolkien's  The Lord of the Rings and means \"Iron Jaws\" in the Elvish language of Sindarin. In the Tolkien universe, \"Carach Angren\", also called \"Isenmouthe\" (both meaning the same) is the name of a fortified pass into the plateau of Gorgoroth in North-Western Mordor.\n\nHistory\nCarach Angren was formed in 2003, in the Dutch municipality of Landgraaf, after two members of Vaultage, Lee Hartney and Inger Indolia, started a side project based on their shared love of legends and black metal. Eventually, Carach Angren was more successful, so both stepped down from Vaultage.\nIn 2004, Carach Angren released their first EP, The Chase Vault Tragedy. The EP is a concept album, telling the story of mysteriously moving coffins known as the Chase Vault Mystery. In 2005, the band released a second EP, Ethereal Veiled Existence, covering the story of the Brown Lady. In 2007, Carach Angren was signed to Maddening Media, a German independent record label. Carach Angren recorded their first full-length album for this label, Lammendam, which received positive international reviews following its release in 2008.Their second album, Death Came Through a Phantom Ship, was released on 26 February 2010.

This concept album covers themes surrounding war, including war, death, and suffering. \nOn 17 February 2015, the band's fourth album, This Is No Fairytale was available for streaming on Metal Hammer. The album was officially released on 23 February 2015. The album is a modern interpretation of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale with themes of domestic abuse, drug addiction, alcoholism, sexual child abuse, suicide, child abduction and cannibalism.\nOn 16 June 2017, their fifth studio album, Dance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten, was released. This album diverges from the previous \"storytelling\" theme of the previous albums, but remains a concept album, with ghost themes, including the Blood Queen and Charles Francis Coghlan.On 10 February 2020, drummer Ivo \"Namtar\" Wijers left the band. According to him, the departure was motivated by \"dissatisfaction with the music industry\". Seregor and Ardek posted the announcement on the band's official website, revealing that the exit was a friendly one, saying, \"Although we are very sorry for your departure, we respect your decision\".\nIn late 2019 the band announced they had begun work on a sixth studio album, scheduled to be released in mid-2020. Its name and release date were unveiled on 20 February 2020; Franckensteina Strataemontanus. The album is a concept album inspired by the life of Johann Konrad Dippel, and was released through Season of Mist on 26 June.\n\nBand members\nDiscography\nPassage 5:\nDance (Keller Williams album)\nDance is the seventh studio album by Keller Williams, released in 2003.

They released one EP in 1998, which was followed by Freedumb (1999), their first studio album in five years.

He had not written songs in 18 years, and as a result of listening to these tapes and getting enthused again, we got him back into it.\"In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Charles Bermant said, \"the best material here is the spirited and melodic 'new' songs, driven by Sal Valentino's pure voice and (former bassist) Declan Mulligan's spry lead guitar.\" \nBermant also noted Elliott's incorporation of bossa nova and reggae into the band's style.Allmusic writer Bruce Eder said that while Live! is a \"decent\" album, \"it isn't remotely the revelation that one would expect or wish for -- the producers might at least have been more honest by foregoing the exclamation point.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\"Nine Pound Hammer\" (Travis) — 3:52\n\"You Tell Me Why\" (Elliott) — 3:34\n\"Turn Around/Singing Cowboy\" (Elliott, Durand) — 8:01\n\"Gate of Hearts\" (Elliott) — 3:18\n\"Lonely People\" (Meagher) — 4:19\n\"Music Speaks Louder\" (Elliott) — 2:49\n\"Lisa\" (Mulligan) — 3:01\n\"Tennessee Walker\" (Elliott) — 4:34\n\"Don't Talk to Strangers\" (Elliott, Durand) — 2:21\n\"Laugh, Laugh\" (Elliott) — 3:15\n\"Lonesome Town\" (Elliott) — 3:09\n\"Free\" (Elliott, Engle) — 3:45\n\"Man and Woman Kind\" (Elliott, Engle) — 4:50\n\"Restless Soul\" (Elliott) — 3:29\n\"Her Dream Alley\" (Elliott) — 2:34\n\"City Girl\" (Elliott, Engle) — 3:29\n\"Paper Plane\" (Elliott) — 2:59\n\"Just a Little\" (Elliott, Durand) — 2:51\n\"Love Can Fall\" (Elliott, Engle) — 4:47\nPassage 10:\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten\nDance and Laugh Amongst the Rotten is the fifth studio album by Dutch symphonic black metal band Carach Angren. It was released on June 16, 2017 via Season of Mist. Although the album doesn't follow a linear story as their previous albums did, it is still a concept album. Clemens \"Ardek\" Wijers describes the album's concept as visitations from multiple ghosts of the dead; including the \"Blood Queen\" and Charles Francis Coghlan. The full album is focused on a nameless girl who plays with a Ouija board causing her to raise a variety of spirits and ends up getting possessed. The album ends by informing the listener that the box the CD came in is haunted by these same spirits, and that by opening the album, the listener has also released them.\n\nTrack listing\nComposed by Ardek.\nGuitars written by Ardek (tracks 5 to 9) and Seregor (tracks 2 to 9).\nLyrics by Ardek (tracks 3, 5, 7 & 9) and Seregor (tracks 2, 4, 6 & 8)\nViolin written by Ardek (tracks 3 to 9)\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nCarach Angren\n\nDennis \"Seregor\" Droomers – guitar, sound effects, vocals, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nClemens \"Ardek\" Wijers – guitar, bass, keyboards, orchestral arrangements, orchestration, violin, backing vocals on \"Opening\"\nIvo \"Namtar\" Wijers – drums, sound effectsAdditional musiciansPatrick Damiani – guitar, bass, guitar engineer\nNikos Mavridis – violin (tracks 3 to 9)TeamCostin Chioreanu – artwork, design\nJonas Kjellgren – mastering\nPeter Tägtgren – mixing, drum engineering\nSylvy Notermans – proof reading\nErik Wijnands – lyric consultant\n\nCharts", "answers": ["the Netherlands"], "length": 3287, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "9ba6e5905bd2df894da4f773da7a85162463143e34f5f6d4"}
{"input": "What Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales created in 1906 covers suburbs like Alexandria?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAustralian Electoral Commission\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is the independent federal agency in charge of organising, conducting and supervising federal Australian elections, by-elections and referendums.\n\nResponsibilities\nThe AEC's main responsibility is to conduct federal elections, by-elections and referendums. The AEC is also responsible for the maintenance of up-to-date electoral rolls, devising electorate boundaries, apportionments and redistributions. Under the Joint Roll Arrangements, the AEC maintains electoral rolls for the whole of Australia, other than Western Australia, which is used by the state and territory Electoral Commissions to conduct their elections. The AEC publishes detailed election results and follows up electors who had failed to vote or who have voted multiple times in an election.\nThe AEC is also responsible for registering political parties intending to field candidates at federal elections, monitoring the activities of those political parties, including receiving returns from parties of donations and expenditures, and the publication of the information. The AEC also plays an electoral education role, aiming to educate citizens about the electoral process by which representatives are elected, and by which the Australian Constitution is changed (referendums). It also plays a role in industrial voting and protected action ballots (e.g., votes on industrial action).\nThe rules for federal elections are contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, while the rules for referendums are contained in the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984.\n\nRegistration of political parties\nThe formal registration of political parties in Australia commenced in New South Wales in 1981 and 1984 for the Commonwealth. The AEC is required to maintain a register of political parties. Such registration is required before a party can field candidates, receive public funding, have party identification on ballot papers and use above-the-line ticket voting.In all jurisdictions, conditions relating to a party name require party names to have a maximum of six words, not be obscene and not to resemble the name of another, unrelated party, be likely to cause confusion with another party nor contain the word 'independent' or 'independent party'.\nAll Australian jurisdictions also have a minimum membership requirement, which differs widely, especially when compared with the total number of people enrolled in the jurisdiction. These range from 100 in the ACT and Tasmania, 200 in SA, 500 in Vic and WA, 1,500 for the Commonwealth and 750 in New South Wales. Four jurisdictions require a fee for registration: $500 for the Commonwealth, Victoria and the Northern Territory; and $2,000 for New South Wales.\n\nPublic funding of political parties\nSince 1984, Australian political parties have been publicly funded by the AEC. The objective of public funding is to reduce the influence of private money upon elections, and consequently, the influence of private money upon the shaping of public policy. After each election, the AEC distributes a set amount of money to each political party, per vote received. A candidate or Senate group needs 4% of the primary vote to be eligible for public funding.After the 2013 election, political parties and candidates received $58.1 million in election funding, with the funding rate being 248.800 cents per vote. The Liberal Party received $23.9 million, as part of the Coalition total of $27.2 million, while the Labor Party received $20.8 million. Other significant recipients were Australian Greens with $5.5 million, Palmer United Party with $2.3 million, and Liberal Democratic Party with $1.0 million.In 2016, $62.7 million was distributed, with the funding rate being 262.784 cents per vote.\n\nElectoral roll\nOne of the functions of the AEC is the maintenance of the electoral roll, which in some other countries are called electoral registers. In Australia voter registration is called \"enrolment\". The AEC maintains Australia's federal electoral roll, which is used for federal elections, by-elections and referendums. Australia has maintained a permanent federal electoral roll since 1908 and, by amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, enrolment has been compulsory for federal elections since 1924. The requirement to register then applied to \"British subjects\" over the age of 21.\nThough each state and territory also has its own electoral commission or office, voters need to register only with the AEC, which shares the registration details with the relevant state electoral commission. The federal roll also forms the basis of state (except in Victoria and Western Australia, which maintain their own rolls) and local electoral rolls.AEC registration covers federal, state and local voter registration. In Australia and in each state and territory, it is a legal offence to fail to vote (or, at the very least, attend a polling station and have one's name crossed off the roll) at any federal or state election, punishable by a nominal fine. The amount varies between federal and state elections. (The fine for not voting is currently A$75.00 in Victoria. This figure is indexed at the beginning of every financial year.) Usually people are issued with warnings when it is found that they have not voted, and they are given an opportunity to show cause. Acceptable reasons for not voting may include being in the accident department of a hospital, being ill (requires confirmation), being out of the country on election day, religious objections, being incarcerated, etc. \"I forgot\" is not considered acceptable and will incur a fine. Section 245 of the Electoral Act (Cwth) provides that if an elector has been asked the \"true reason\" for his failure to vote states that he did not do so because it was against his religion, this statement shall be regarded as conclusive, and no further action will be taken.\nTraditionally, voters cannot register within three weeks of an election. In 2004 the Howard government passed legislation that prevented registration after 8 pm on the day that the writs were issued (this can be up to 10 days after the election has been announced). This legislation was considered controversial by some Australians who contended it disenfranchised first-time voters or those who have forgotten to update their enrolment. The law was repealed just before the 2010 federal election, after advocacy group GetUp! obtained a High Court ruling that the changes were unconstitutional. 16 and 17 year olds can provisionally enrol and are able to vote when they turn 18.\n\nHistory and structure\nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902 set up the framework for the Commonwealth electoral system, which was administered until 1916 as a branch of the Department of Home Affairs, then until 1928 by the Department of Home and Territories, back to Department of Home Affairs until 1932 and then Department of the Interior until 1972. The Australian Electoral Office was created in 1973 by the Australian Electoral Office Act 1973. On 21 February 1984 the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) was established as a Commonwealth statutory authority.\nThe AEC is answerable to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the Parliament of Australia, and must report on how elections were carried out and the success of elections in general.\nThe AEC was created by and operates under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. It consists of a chairman (a judge or a retired judge of the federal court), the electoral commissioner and a non-judicial member (usually the Australian Statistician). The electoral commissioner has the powers of a secretary of a department under the Public Service Act 1999 and the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1998. The chairperson and the third, non-judicial member both hold their offices on a part-time basis.\nEach House of Representatives electorate has a Divisional Returning Officer responsible for administration of elections within the division. Each State also has an Australian Electoral Officer responsible for administration of Senate elections. The AEC has a National Office in Canberra and an office in each State and Territory: Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney.\nAfter the loss of 1,400 ballots during the recount for the 2013 Western Australia Senate election and the subsequent 2014 special election, the AEC came under significant scrutiny, leading to the resignation of Commissioner Ed Killesteyn.\n\nList of Australian Electoral Commissioners\nSee also\nAlbert Langer\nElectoral system of Australia\nCompulsory voting\nGetup Ltd v Electoral CommissionerElectoral commissions of each state and self governing territory:\n\nAustralian Capital Territory Electoral Commission\nNew South Wales Electoral Commission\nNorthern Territory Electoral Commission\nElectoral Commission of Queensland\nElectoral Commission of South Australia\nTasmanian Electoral Commission\nVictorian Electoral Commission\nWestern Australian Electoral Commission\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nThe Australian Electoral Commission website\nThe Electoral Council of Australia and New Zealand website, the consultative council between the AEC, New Zealand, state and territory electoral authorities\nCommonwealth Electoral Act 1918\nReferendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984\nPassage 2:\nDivision of Cook (1906–55)\nThe Division of Cook was an Australian Electoral Division in New South Wales. The division was created in 1906 and abolished in 1955. The Division was named for James Cook, who explored the east coast of Australia in 1770. It was located in the inner suburbs of Sydney, taking in the suburbs of Alexandria, Redfern and Surry Hills. It has been a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, but in the 1930s and 1940s it was fiercely contested between Federal Labor and Lang Labor factions of the party.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nSee also\nDivision of Cook\nPassage 3:\nDivision of Lang\nThe Division of Lang was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, and was named after Rev. John Dunmore Lang, a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and advocate of Australian independence. It originally included the suburbs of Kogarah and Marrickville, but by the time it was abolished in 1977, it covered the suburbs of Lakemba and Belmore.  The Division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 75 divisions to be contested at the first Federal election.  It was held by the Labor Party for all but one term after 1928, and in its final form was very safe for that party.  It was abolished at the redistribution of 31 October 1977.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 4:\nDivision of Barrier\nThe Division of Barrier was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was named for the Barrier Ranges near the city of Broken Hill in western New South Wales. In 1901, it included Broken Hill, Wilcannia, White Cliffs and Tibooburra and the surrounding pastoral areas. In 1906, it gained Menindee, Wentworth from Riverina and in 1913, it gained Balranald and Deniliquin from Riverina. It was abolished in 1922 with Broken Hill, Wentworth and Balranald being transferred to Darling and Deniliquin transferred to Riverina. It was a very safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, although both its members left the ALP at the end their terms: Josiah Thomas to join the Nationalists, and Michael Considine (a radical socialist) to sit as an independent.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 5:\nDivision of Phillip\nThe Division of Phillip was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of New South Wales. It was located in the Sydney's eastern suburbs, and was named after Captain Arthur Phillip, captain of the First Fleet and first Governor of New South Wales. The Division included the suburbs of Bondi, Coogee, Kensington and Randwick.\nThe Division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 11 May 1949, and was first contested at the 1949 Federal election. It was abolished prior to the 1993 Federal election.  It was a marginal seat that from 1963 onward was held by the governing party of the day.\n\nMembers\n\n\n== Election results ==\nPassage 6:\nDivision of Bland\nThe Division of Bland was an Australian electoral division in New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was abolished in 1906. It was named for Dr William Bland, a New South Wales colonial politician. Based in rural southern New South Wales, it included the towns of Narrandera, Young, Wagga Wagga and West Wyalong. Bland was held by Chris Watson, the first Leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party and Australia's first Labor Prime Minister. When Bland was abolished in 1906, Watson transferred to South Sydney.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 7:\nDivision of Riverina\nThe Division of Riverina is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.\nIt includes the city of Wagga Wagga.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election, although it was abolished between 1984 and 1993, so has not been contested at every federal election. The division was named after the Riverina region in which it is located, though its modern borders do not correspond exactly with the Riverina region. The division covers a primarily agricultural, rural area with many small towns.\nIn the 1984 redistribution, the division was abolished and replaced by Riverina-Darling, but in the 1993 redistribution it was re-created.\nSince its re-creation in 1993, it has been a safe Nationals seat. Its first incarnation tilted toward the Nationals' predecessor, the Country Party, for much of its history, but was occasionally taken by Labor during high-tide elections. It was fairly marginal for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, when it included the strongly pro-Labor mining towns of Broken Hill and Cobar which have now been transferred to Farrer and Parkes.\nThe division is located in South-West rural New South Wales, generally following the Murrumbidgee River valley. It includes the larger city of Wagga Wagga, as well as the towns of Cowra, Forbes, Junee, Cootamundra, Temora, West Wyalong, Young, Tumut and Gundagai. The Sturt Highway runs along the length of the division, and it contains a large section of the Newell Highway.\nThe Division of Riverina also contains the major town of Parkes which has the same name as the bordering Division of Parkes.\nThe seat has previously been held by Al Grassby, Minister for Immigration in the Whitlam government. The current Member for Riverina, since the 2010 federal election, is Michael McCormack, former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party of Australia from 2018 to 2021.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 8:\nDivision of Maribyrnong\nThe Division of Maribyrnong is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. It is located in the inner north-western suburbs of Melbourne. Suburbs include Aberfeldie, Airport West, Avondale Heights, Essendon, Footscray, Gowanbrae, Keilor East, Maribyrnong, Moonee Ponds, Niddrie, West Footscray and Tullamarine. Due to redistributions, the division has been slowly moving west and changed with the introduction of the  Division of Fraser in 2018. According to the 2011 census, Maribyrnong has the highest proportion of Catholics in any Commonwealth Electoral Division in Australia with 41.6% of the population.\n\nGeography\nSince 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state's representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.\n\nHistory\nThe division was proclaimed at the redistribution of 13 July 1906, and was first contested at the 1906 election. The division was named after the Maribyrnong River, which runs through it. A safe Labor seat for most of the first half of the 20th century, it became a marginal Liberal seat for most of the 1950s and 1960s, in part due to the influence of the Democratic Labor Party. Labor retook the seat in 1969, and for most of the time since then, it has been a comfortably safe Labor seat.\nProminent former members include James Fenton, a minister under James Scullin and Joseph Lyons; Arthur Drakeford, a minister under John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley; and Moss Cass, a minister under Gough Whitlam. The current member for Maribyrnong since the 2007 election is the former National Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union and former Opposition Leader Bill Shorten.\n\nMembers\nElection results\nPassage 9:\nAlexandria, New South Wales\nAlexandria is an inner southern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Alexandria is located 5 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. The postcode is 2015.The rough boundaries of Alexandria are Botany Road to the east, Gardeners Road to the south, Mitchell Road and Sydney Park to the west, and Boundary Road to the north. It is approximately 3.5 km south of Central station.\n\nHistory\nThe Parish of Alexandria was established in 1835. The naming of Alexandria and neighbouring Waterloo commemorates the famous British Empire military and naval victories over Napoleon – the Battles of Alexandria and Waterloo.  The Iron Duke Hotel in Alexandria is itself named after the Duke of Wellington, as is Wellington Street in Waterloo. It was thought Alexandria may have been named after Princess Alexandra, Queen consort of King Edward VII, however, Alexandra was born on 1 December 1844 and the parish's naming predates the birth of Alexandra by six years.\nIn 1868, the Municipality of Alexandria was formed, after separating from Waterloo. The former Alexandria Town Hall is in Garden Street. Land for the building was acquired in 1879; the building was designed by Ferdinand Reuss Snr and completed in 1881. Major alterations took place over the years, right up to 1928. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.By 1943, Alexandria was the largest industrial district in Australia, and known as the \"Birmingham of Australia\", with everything from bricks to aeroplanes manufactured in 550 factories in just 1,000 acres (4.0 km2). The municipality was abolished upon merger into the City of Sydney in 1949, along with Darlington, Erskineville, Newtown, Redfern, Waterloo, Paddington and The Glebe.\nIn 1968 the boundaries were changed again and Alexandria was part of a new municipality, South Sydney Council. South Sydney was brought back into the City of Sydney in 1982 and then became separate again under the City of Sydney Act of 1988. In 2004, Alexandria moved back into the City of Sydney, when the City of Sydney was merged with the City of South Sydney.\n\nTrams\nThe former Alexandria tram line opened in 1902 as a single-track electric line that was duplicated in 1910. The line branched off from the Botany line at the junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in Alexandria. The line proceeded down Henderson Road then swung left into Mitchell Road. A turn-back was provided at Ashmore Road (near Erskineville Oval) for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known as an extension of Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the Princes Highway near St Peters railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction.  The line was closed in 1959. Transit Systems route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.\n\nHeritage listings\nAlexandria has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nAlexandra Canal\n39 Brandling Street: Enginemans Resthouse\n16-22 Retreat Street: Yiu Ming Temple\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2021 census, there were 9,649 people living in Alexandria.At the 2016 census, Alexandria had a population of 8,262. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.7% of the population. The most common ancestries in Alexandria were English 22.6%, Australian 17.5%, Irish 10.8%, Scottish 6.9% and Chinese 5.8%. 59.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 5.4%, New Zealand 3.7%, China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 2.6%, Ireland 1.3% and the United States 1.0%. 72.1% of people spoke only English at home.

The suburb was once mostly terraced housing, that was demolished for light industrial use and warehousing which continues to this day. Pockets of quiet residential areas remain along the northern boundary of the suburb, adjoining Erskineville and Waterloo.\nVirgin Atlantic has its Australia offices on Level 3 Eastside in the Sydney Corporate Park in Alexandria.\n\nGreen Square\nAlexandria is part of the Green Square district, in the north east of the suburb, which is undergoing gentrification. This involves an urban renewal project that is constructing modern retail, business and medium-high density residential developments.\n\nSouth Sydney Markets\nEstablished in September 2009, its main purpose was to meet the community demand for local markets, providing fine produce and a venue for local handmade crafts. The children's activities kept the little ones entertained with face painting and a kids zoo. It was open every Sunday 10am - 3pm at 75-85 O'Riordan St Alexandria however, it has unfortunately been temporarily closed.\n\nTransport\nAlexandria is serviced by Transdev John Holland routes to the Sydney central business district. Alexandria is close to two railway lines on the Sydney Trains network. Green Square railway station, located on the north-eastern fringe, is on the Airport & South Line. Erskineville railway station and St Peters railway station are serviced by the Bankstown Line. Both are within easy walking distance, to the west of Alexandria.\n\nCulture\nAlexandria has the headquarters of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Australia and New Zealand.\nAlexandria is the location for a Chinese community centred on the Yiu Ming Temple in Retreat Street. The temple was heritage-listed in 1999, along with the terraced houses that line Retreat Street.\n\nSport and recreation\nSydney Park is a large recreational area on the western border. Alexandria Park and McKell Playground are situated on Buckland Street. Tennis courts and a cricket oval are located here. Erskineville Oval is just over the western border. Erskineville Oval is the home ground of the Alexandria Rovers junior rugby league team. The Alexandria Dukes Rugby Football Club play in the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union competition and will again contest the Meldrum Cup in 2014.  The club rooms for the Dukes are at the Iron Duke Hotel.\nA number of popular pubs are located in the suburb including the Alexandria Hotel (reopened), Iron Duke Hotel, Buckland Hotel and the Parkview Hotel on Mitchell Road.\n\nGallery\nPassage 10:\nDivision of Canobolas\nThe Division of Canobolas was an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was abolished in 1906, when the Division of Calare was created. It was named after Mount Canobolas (an Aboriginal word meaning \"two peaks\"). It was located in central western New South Wales, including the towns of Forbes, Orange and Parkes. It was held by the Australian Labor Party throughout its existence.\n\nMembers\n\n\n== Election results ==", "answers": ["Division of Cook"], "length": 3918, "dataset": "hotpotqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "69a7a204e296babb322d3fe7c7ee60e6b8f0f70e237abb80"}

He was \"discovered\" while working at the BBC, sorting records for Desert Island Discs. A producer for the show heard him singing \"Questa o quella\" from Rigoletto while working, and suggested he study professionally.Rendall entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1970, and the Salzburg Mozarteum in 1973. He won a Young Musician of the Year Award from the Greater London Arts Association in 1973 and received a Gulbenkian Fellowship in 1975. In May 1978 he sang the tenor part of Anton Bruckner's Te Deum under the baton of Herbert von Karajan during a performance at Musikverein Hall of Vienna with Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nPerforming career\nAt Covent Garden, Rendall sang the roles of the Italian singer in Der Rosenkavalier, Almaviva in The Barber of Seville, Des Grieux in Manon, Matteo in Arabella, Rodrigo in La donna del lago, Flamand in Capriccio, and the Duke in Rigoletto. After making his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1980 as Ernesto in Don Pasquale, he returned as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, subsequently performing Lensky in Eugene Onegin, Matteo in Arabella, Ferrando in Cosi fan Tutte and the title role of Idomeneo.He also performed with the English National Opera from 1976 to 1992, with the New York City Opera, San Francisco Opera, and many other opera companies in the United States, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Italy, Georgia, Japan, Denmark, and Germany.Rendall was involved in a peculiar onstage incident in 1998 when he accidentally stabbed baritone Kimm Julian in the death scene of I Pagliacci during a rehearsal with the Florentine Opera. The switchblade-style knife that the Milwaukee opera company used failed to collapse, and the baritone received a 3-inch-deep (76 mm) cut into his abdomen. Julian recovered and police cleared Rendall of any wrongdoing. He suffered injuries from a collapsing stage set during an April 2005 performance on stage in Copenhagen, and his career was subsequently curtailed. Rendall returned to performance in June 2013.Rendall is married to the British lyric mezzo-soprano Diana Montague.  Their son is the baritone Huw Montague Rendall.\n\nRecordings\nRendall's recordings include Berlioz, Requiem in 1979 conducted by Michael Gielen,  Maria Stuarda with Charles Mackerras and the English National Opera in 1982 and La rondine with Lorin Maazel and the London Symphony Orchestra in 1985.\n\nSee also\nMozart: Così fan tutte (Alain Lombard recording)\nThe Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala, Deutsche Grammophon DVD, 00440-073-4538, 2009\nPassage 2:\nPowell Lloyd\nHarold Powell Lloyd (known as Powell Lloyd) (1900 – 1987) was an English operatic tenor and opera director and producer.\n\nBiography\nLloyd studied singing at Morley College and later with Amy Martin and Herbert Oliver. He began his career as an actor at the Old Vic in his early 20s, excelling in the plays of William Shakespeare. During this time he also sang in the opera chorus. In 1923 he began to appear as a soloist with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic; mostly in buffo roles. While there he met his future wife, operatic mezzo-soprano Edith Coates. The couple married in 1933 and often performed together.Lloyd remained with Baylis's company when they moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931 and later became a producer and director for the company.

He also had two major successes at the Royal Opera, London: the witch in Hänsel und Gretel (1934) and David in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1936) under conductor Thomas Beecham. The latter role was recorded on Columbia Records.Lloyd's career was put on hold while the London stages were closed during World War II. After the war he worked mainly as an opera director and producer. He worked for the Sadler's Wells Theatre, Theatre Scarborough, the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and the opera houses in Dublin and Johannesburg during the 1940s.

The song forms the centrepiece of The Snowman, which has become a seasonal favourite on British and Finnish television. The story relates the fleeting adventures of a young boy and a snowman who has come to life. In the second part of the story, the boy and the snowman fly to the North Pole. \"Walking in the Air\" is the theme for the journey. They attend a party of snowmen, at which the boy seems to be the only human until they meet Father Christmas with his reindeer, and the boy is given a scarf with a snowman pattern. In the film, the song was performed by St Paul's Cathedral choirboy Peter Auty; this performance was reissued in 1985 (on Stiff Records) and 1987.In 1985, an altered version was recorded for use in a TV advertising campaign for Toys \"R\" Us. While it was believed that Auty's voice had then broken, Auty claimed in an interview with BBC Breakfast News on 2 December 2022 that his voice had not broken and he was never contacted for the recording. Blake recommended the then-14-year-old Welsh chorister Aled Jones, whose recording reached number five in the UK Singles Chart, and who became a popular celebrity on the strength of his performance. The association of the song with Jones, combined with Auty not being credited on The Snowman, led to a common misbelief that Jones performed the song in the film.  \"Walking in the Air\" has subsequently been performed by over forty artists, in a variety of styles. In a UK poll in 2012, the Aled Jones version was voted 13th on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\n\nNightwish version\nIn 1998, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish covered the song for their second studio album, Oceanborn, in a power ballad style. A shorter version of it was released on 30 January 1999 as the second single from the album, featuring two b-sides. It spent eighteen weeks on the Finnish charts, peaking at number one for a week. The band named the compilation Walking in the Air: The Greatest Ballads after this song.\nThe song was performed regularly during Tarja Turunen's time with the band as the lead singer; after her departure, she went on to record her own version for her 2006 winter album Henkäys Ikuisuudesta.\nNightwish's founding member and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen had stated that it is his all-time favourite piece of music.\n\nTrack listing\n\"Walking in the Air\" (radio edit) – 3:41\n\"Nightquest\" (Tuomas Holopainen) – 4:15\n\"Tutankhamen\" (Nightwish, Holopainen) – 5:30\n\nOther notable recorded versions\nIn 1983, the British rock band Rainbow covered the song for their 7th studio album, Bent out of Shape. The song is called Snowman.\nAled Jones (as a teen boy soprano) reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1985 with his cover. He released it again, in a duet with himself (as an adult baritone), on his 2007 Album You Raise Me Up: The Best of Aled Jones. In 2022, Jones recorded a duet version with tenor Russell Watson, which was included on the Christmas with Aled and Russell album of the same year.\nChloë Agnew (from Celtic Woman) in 2004 released her debut solo album titled Walking in the Air which hit number 13 on Billboard's Classical Albums Chart, and peaked at number 4 on Billboard's World Music chart. The song is the first track.\nDigital Dream Baby's \"Walking in the Air\", an electronic dance remix, peaked at number 49 in December 1991 in the UK's album chart.\nMcFly released their cover of the song on 2 December 2021. The single enjoyed a brief run on the UK Downloads chart, topping at number 25.\n\nUses in other media\nA parody version of it was used in a Scottish television commercial in 2006, for an Irn-Bru advert. It was reused in the advert's sequel in 2018.\nIt was used in a 2013 World Wide Fund for Nature commercial showing on YouTube, performed by Vajèn van den Bosch.\nPassage 4:\nDavid Hillman\nDavid Hillman may refer to:\n\nDavid Hillman (tenor)\nDavid Hillman (politician)\n\nSee also\nDave Hillman, American baseball player\nPassage 5:\nJohn Mitchinson (tenor)\nJohn Leslie Mitchinson (31 March 1932 – 17 December 2021) was an English operatic tenor.Mitchinson was born in Blackrod, Lancashire.

At the age of 13, he sang \"Walking in the Air\", the theme song of the 1982 animated film, The Snowman, but in the rush to finish the film his name was omitted from the credits until the film was remastered for its 20th anniversary in 2002.\nThe composer, Howard Blake, decided to re-record the song for a commercial for Toys \"R\" Us in 1985. Aled Jones was chosen instead and the song became a hit single. Many people assumed that Jones was the singer in the version used in the film.\n\nOpera singer\nAuty took the role of Camille in York Light Opera Company's production of The Merry Widow in 1995. Subsequently, he moved to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama where he studied under Peter Alexander Wilson. At the summer performance in 1997 of Prokofiev's Betrothal in a Monastery (given as The Duenna), the Opera critic noted \"another potentially Wagnerian voice, the tenor Peter Auty, a very young-looking Don Jerome; the voice has that edge of smoky colour one associates with a Siegfried, but still has to settle into its own space and breadth\".Auty's professional stage debut was with Opera North in 1998. With the company, he subsequently sang the roles of Rodolfo in La bohème during the 2001-02 season and Don José in Carmen in 2011. At Covent Garden he played the Major-Domo to the Marschallin in the 2000 run of Der Rosenkavalier under Thielemann, Michelis in the 2000 run of The Greek Passion under Mackerras, Flavio in Norma, Maintop in Billy Budd and a Shepherd in Tristan und Isolde in 2000, Roderigo in Otello, Gastone in La traviata and Third Esquire in Parsifal in 2001, Malcolm in Macbeth in 2002, and Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor in 2003.Elsewhere in Britain he sang at Glyndebourne Festival Opera (Rodrigo in Verdi's Otello and Nemorino in Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore). His Don José for the Glyndebourne tour in 2002 was described as \"beautifully sung, deeply troubled\".There have also been roles with Scottish Opera and English National Opera. In other parts of Europe he has appeared in many other venues such as Frankfurt and Rouen. For the ENO Rigoletto in 2006, his Duke led a reviewer to comment that his \"brilliant top and equally sensitive shaping of lines made him a Duke of real distinction. On this and other recent showings, Auty is surely the finest lyric tenor in the Italian repertoire the UK has produced since the young Dennis O'Neill\".In 2018 he sang the \"exhausting\" title role in the stage premiere (and UK premiere) of Konstantin Boyarsky's Pushkin at Grange Park Opera. As the only non-Russian in the cast \"Auty coped heroically with Boyarsky's demanding vocal lines, and emphasized Pushkin's ardour and naiveté, nonchalantly delivering the many quotes (in Russian) that pepper the libretto.Auty has also performed concerts with orchestras both in his home country and abroad, such as London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Vladimir Ashkenazy and Royal Flemish Philharmonic led by Edo de Waart.\n\nSelected discography\nDvořák: Requiem, Op. 89 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra Neeme Järvi; 2009 (London Philharmonic Orchestra – LPO)\nBrian: Symphony No. 1 'Gothic' - BBC forces under Martyn Brabbins; 2011 (Hyperion)\nDonizetti: L'elisir d'amore (as Nemorino) - Glyndebourne Opera, Maurizio Benini (video); 2010 (Opus Arte)\nDvořák: Stabat Mater, Op. 58 - London Philharmonic Choir & Orchestra, Neeme Järvi; 2012 (LPO)\nElgar: The Dream of Gerontius - Royal Flemish Philharmonic, Edo de Waart; 2013 (Pentatone)\nVerdi: Rigoletto (as Borsa) - Royal Opera House Covent Garden, Edward Downes (video); 2013 (Opus Arte)\nJoubert: St. Mark Passion - Wells Cathedral Choir, Matthew Owens; 2017 (Resonus Classics)\nPassage 8:\nNicholas Sharratt\nNicholas Sharratt (born in Nottingham) is an English operatic tenor.\n\nBiography\nSharratt studied at the Royal Northern College of Music and the National Opera Studio.He has performed the title role in Orpheus in the Underworld for Scottish Opera and Ernesto in Don Pasquale for English Touring Opera.

It is situated approximately 10 km from Covadonga and 25 km from Cangas de Onís. A curving road is available from Arriondas to the lake. Measuring 0.1 square kilometres (0.039 sq mi), it is one of the biggest lakes in the area. Lake Enol is situated 1,070 metres (3,510 ft) above sea level, in the Picos de Europa). It was formed by the withdrawal of a front glacier.\n\nCulture\nA submerged image of the Virgin Mary is elevated every year on 8 September and then taken out for a procession.

Timanfaya National Park represents a sign of recent and historical volcanism in the Macaronesian Region. The last volcanic eruptions occurred during the 18th century as well as on the 19th century.\n\nVolcanic activity\nThe greatest recorded eruptions occurred between 1730 and 1736. The volcanic activity continues as the surface temperature in the core ranges from 100 to 600 °C (212 to 1,112 °F) at the depth of 13 metres (43 ft), which is demonstrated by pouring water into the ground, resulting in a geyser of steam which is an attraction for tourists. There is only one active volcano, Timanfaya volcano, after which the park is named.\n\nEcological value\nIn 1993, UNESCO designated a Biosphere reserve covering the whole of Lanzarote. The national park is one of the core areas of the biosphere reserve.\nAccess to the park by the public is strictly regulated to protect the delicate flora and fauna.
