Maybe Mexicans are right and not we?\r\nLonya: I'm not sure. I'll think about it.\r\nLonya: Maybe what I object most to is the fact that they don't explicitly say it's reconstruction.

Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!\r\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\r\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\r\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\r\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100€, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130€ a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches. Even one glass of it.\r\nDennis: What you say will make me think twice before setting sail for Cuba.\r\nLaura: But it can be fantastic as well. Eg Vinales Valley in the west, with its horse-riding trips, wild camping and pure nature.\r\nDennis: Sounds better. I'll ask you for details.\r\nDennis: Anyway enjoy your trip as much as you can. Happy trails toyou two!\r\nLaura: Thank you, Dennis.\nSummary: Laura is in Cuba at the moment. She has mixed feelings about Cuba. She's travelling with her companion. Cuba is expensive for tourists. She has to spend over 100€ on a daily basis.\n", "answers": ["Kirsten reminds Alex that the youth group meets this Friday at 7 pm and go bowling."], "length": 2797, "dataset": "samsum_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b2b3903cc4020eaef687c516d4a21297b9deb76c22bd7616"}
