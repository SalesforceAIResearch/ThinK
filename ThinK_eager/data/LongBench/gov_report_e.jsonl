{"input": "", "context": "The design and development of information systems can be complex undertakings, consisting of a multitude of pieces of equipment and software products, and service providers. Each of the components of an information system may rely on one or more supply chains—that is, the set of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources that create and move a product or service from suppliers to an organization’s customers. Obtaining a full understanding of the sources of a given information system can also be extremely complex. According to the Software Engineering Institute, the identity of each product or service provider may not be visible to others in the supply chain. Typically, an acquirer, such as a federal agency, may only know about the participants to which it is directly connected in the supply chain. Further, the complexity of corporate structures, in which a parent company (or its subsidiaries) may own or control companies that conduct business under different names in multiple countries, presents additional challenges to fully understanding the sources of an information system. As a result, the acquirer may have little visibility into the supply chains of its suppliers. Federal procurement law and policies promote the acquisition of commercial products when they meet the government’s needs. Commercial providers of IT use a global supply chain to design, develop, manufacture, and distribute hardware and software products throughout the world. Consequently, the federal government relies heavily on IT equipment manufactured in foreign nations. Federal information and communications systems can include a multitude of IT equipment, products, and services, each of which may rely on one or more supply chains. These supply chains can be long, complex, and globally distributed and can consist of multiple tiers of outsourcing. As a result, agencies may have little visibility into, understanding of, or control over how the technology that they acquire is developed, integrated, and deployed, as well as the processes, procedures, and practices used to ensure the integrity, security, resilience, and quality of the products and services. Table 1 highlights possible manufacturing locations of typical components of a computer or information systems network. Moreover, many of the manufacturing inputs required for these components—whether physical materials or knowledge—are acquired from various sources around the globe. Figure 1 depicts the potential countries of origin of common suppliers of various components in a commercially available laptop computer. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the information systems and information that support the operations and assets of the agency. The act also requires that agencies ensure that information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each agency information system. FISMA assigns NIST the responsibility for providing standards and guidelines on information security to agencies. In addition, the act authorizes DHS to develop and issue binding operational directives to agencies, including directives that specify requirements for the mitigation of exigent risks to information systems. NIST has issued several special publications (SP) that provide guidelines to federal agencies on controls and activities relevant to managing supply chain risk. For example, NIST SP 800-39 provides an approach to organization-wide management of information security risk, which states that organizations should monitor risk on an ongoing basis as part of a comprehensive risk management program. NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 4) provides a catalogue of controls from which agencies are to select controls for their information systems. It also specifies several control activities that organizations could use to provide additional supply chain protections, such as conducting due diligence reviews of suppliers and developing acquisition policy, and implementing procedures that help protect against supply chain threats throughout the system development life cycle. NIST SP 800-161 provides guidance to federal agencies on identifying, assessing, selecting, and implementing risk management processes and mitigating controls throughout their organizations to help manage information and communications technology supply chain risks. In addition, as of June 2018, DHS has issued one binding operational directive related to an IT supply chain-related threat. Specifically, in September 2017, DHS issued a directive to all federal executive branch departments and agencies to remove and discontinue present and future use of Kaspersky-branded products on all federal information systems. In consultation with interagency partners, DHS determined that the risks presented by these products justified their removal. Beyond these guidelines and requirements, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 also included provisions related to supply chain security. Specifically, Section 806 authorizes the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to exclude a contractor from specific types of procurements on the basis of a determination of significant supply chain risk to a covered system. Section 806 also establishes requirements for limiting disclosure of the basis of such procurement action. In several reports issued since 2012, we have pointed out that the reliance on complex, global IT supply chains introduces multiple risks to federal information and telecommunications systems. This includes the risk of these systems being manipulated or damaged by leading foreign cyber-threat nations such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Threats and vulnerabilities created by these cyber-threat nations, vendors or suppliers closely linked to cyber-threat nations, and other malicious actors can be sophisticated and difficult to detect and, thus, pose a significant risk to organizations and federal agencies. As we reported in March 2012, supply chain threats are present at various phases of a system’s development life cycle. Key threats that could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies include the following. Installation of hardware or software containing malicious logic, which is hardware, firmware, or software that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a harmful purpose. Malicious logic can cause significant damage by allowing attackers to take control of entire systems and, thereby, read, modify, or delete sensitive information; disrupt operations; launch attacks against other organizations’ systems; or destroy systems. Installation of counterfeit hardware or software, which is hardware or software containing non-genuine component parts or code. According to the Defense Department’s Information Assurance Technology Analysis Center, counterfeit IT threatens the integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability of information systems for several reasons, including the facts that (1) counterfeits are usually less reliable and, therefore, may fail more often and more quickly than genuine parts; and (2) counterfeiting presents an opportunity for the counterfeiter to insert malicious logic or backdoors into replicas or copies that would be far more difficult in more secure manufacturing facilities. Failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products. Both man-made (e.g., disruptions caused by labor, trade, or political disputes) and natural (e.g., earthquakes, fires, floods, or hurricanes) causes could decrease the availability of material needed to develop systems or disrupt the supply of IT products critical to the operations of federal agencies. Reliance on a malicious or unqualified service provider for the performance of technical services. By virtue of their position, contractors and other service providers may have access to federal data and systems. Service providers could attempt to use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks. Installation of hardware or software that contains unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defects in code that can be exploited. Cyber attackers may focus their efforts on, among other things, finding and exploiting existing defects in software code. Such defects are usually the result of unintentional coding errors or misconfigurations, and can facilitate attempts by attackers to gain unauthorized access to an agency’s information systems and data, or disrupt service. We noted in the March 2012 report that threat actors can introduce these threats into federal information systems by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the global supply chain. In addition, supply chain vulnerabilities can include weaknesses in agency acquisition or security procedures, controls, or implementation related to an information system. Examples of the types of vulnerabilities that could be exploited include acquisitions of IT products or parts from sources other than the original manufacturer or authorized reseller, such as independent distributors, brokers, or on the gray market; lack of adequate testing for software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. If a threat actor exploits an existing vulnerability, it could lead to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system and associated information. This, in turn, can adversely affect an agency’s ability to carry out its mission. In March 2012, we reported that the four national security-related agencies (i.e., Defense, Justice, Energy, and DHS) had acknowledged the risks presented by supply chain vulnerabilities. However, the agencies varied in the extent to which they had addressed these risks by (1) defining supply chain protection measures for department information systems, (2) developing implementing procedures for these measures, and (3) establishing capabilities for monitoring compliance with, and the effectiveness of, such measures. Of the four agencies, the Department of Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. Specifically, the department’s supply chain risk management efforts began in 2003 and included: a policy requiring supply chain risk to be addressed early and across a system’s entire life cycle and calling for an incremental implementation of supply chain risk management through a series of pilot projects; a requirement that every acquisition program submit and update a “program protection plan” that was to, among other things, help manage risks from supply chain exploits or design vulnerabilities; procedures for implementing supply chain protection measures, such as an implementation guide describing 32 specific measures for enhancing supply chain protection and procedures for program protection plans identifying ways in which programs should manage supply chain risk; and a monitoring mechanism to determine the status and effectiveness of supply chain protection pilot projects, as well as monitoring compliance with and effectiveness of program protection policies and procedures for several acquisition programs. Conversely, our report noted that the other three agencies had made limited progress in addressing supply chain risks for their information systems. For example: The Department of Justice had defined specific security measures for protecting against supply chain threats through the use of provisions in vendor contracts and agreements. Officials identified (1) a citizenship and residency requirement and (2) a national security risk questionnaire as two provisions that addressed supply chain risk. However, Justice had not developed procedures for ensuring the effective implementation of these protection measures or a mechanism for verifying compliance with, and the effectiveness of these measures. We stressed that, without such procedures, Justice would have limited assurance that its departmental information systems were being adequately protected against supply chain threats. In May 2011, the Department of Energy revised its information security program, which required Energy components to implement provisions based on NIST and Committee on National Security Systems guidance. However, the department was unable to provide details on implementation progress, milestones for completion, or how supply chain protection measures would be defined. Because it had not defined these measures or associated implementing procedures, we reported that the department was not in a position to monitor compliance or effectiveness. Although its information security guidance mentioned the NIST control related to supply chain protection, DHS had not defined the supply chain protection control activities that system owners should employ. The department’s information security policy manager stated that DHS was in the process of developing policy that would address supply chain protection, but did not provide details on when it would be completed. In the absence of such a policy, DHS was not in a position to develop implementation procedures or to monitor compliance or effectiveness. To assist Justice, Energy, and DHS in better addressing IT supply chain- related security risks for their departmental information systems, we made eight recommendations to these three agencies in our 2012 report. Specifically, we recommended that Energy and DHS: develop and document departmental policy that defines which security measures should be employed to protect against supply chain threats. We also recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS: develop, document, and disseminate procedures to implement the supply chain protection security measures defined in departmental policy, and develop and implement a monitoring capability to verify compliance with, and assess the effectiveness of, supply chain protection measures. The three agencies generally agreed with our recommendations and, subsequently, implemented seven of the eight recommendations. Specifically, we verified that Justice and Energy had implemented each of the recommendations we made to them by 2016. We also confirmed that DHS had implemented two of the three recommendations we made to that agency by 2015. However, as of fiscal year 2016, DHS had not fully implemented our recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to verify compliance with, and assess the effectiveness of, supply chain protections. Although the department had developed a policy and approach for monitoring supply chain risk management activities, it could not provide evidence that its components had actually implemented the policy. Thus, we were not able to close the recommendation as implemented. Nevertheless, the implementation of the seven recommendations and partial implementation of the eighth recommendation better positioned the three agencies to monitor and mitigate their IT supply chain risks. In addition, we reported in March 2012 that the four national security- related agencies had participated in interagency efforts to address supply chain security, including participation in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, development of technical and policy tools, and collaboration with the intelligence community. In support of the cybersecurity initiative, Defense and DHS jointly led an interagency initiative on supply chain risk management to address issues of globalization affecting the federal government’s IT. Also, DHS had developed a comprehensive portfolio of technical and policy-based product offerings for federal civilian departments and agencies, including technical assessment capabilities, acquisition support, and incident response capabilities. The efforts of the four agencies could benefit all federal agencies in addressing their IT supply chain risks. In summary, the global IT supply chain introduces a myriad of security risks to federal information systems that, if realized, could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of federal information systems. Thus, the potential exists for serious adverse impact on an agency’s operations, assets, and employees. These factors highlight the importance and urgency of federal agencies appropriately assessing, managing, and monitoring IT supply chain risk as part of their agencywide information security programs.

The supply chain—the set of organizations, people, activities, and resources that create and move a product from suppliers to end users—for IT systems is complex and global in scope. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IT supply chain is a continuing threat. Federal security guidelines provide for managing the risks to the supply chain. This testimony statement highlights information security risks associated with the supply chains used by federal agencies to procure IT systems. The statement also summarizes GAO's 2012 report that assessed the extent to which four national security-related agencies had addressed such risks. To develop this statement, GAO relied on its previous reports, as well as information provided by the national security-related agencies on their actions in response to GAO's previous recommendations. GAO also reviewed federal information security guidelines and directives. Reliance on a global supply chain introduces multiple risks to federal information systems. Supply chain threats are present during the various phases of an information system's development life cycle and could create an unacceptable risk to federal agencies. Information technology (IT) supply chain-related threats are varied and can include: installation of intentionally harmful hardware or software (i.e., containing “malicious logic”); installation of counterfeit hardware or software; failure or disruption in the production or distribution of critical products; reliance on malicious or unqualified service providers for the performance of technical services; and installation of hardware or software containing unintentional vulnerabilities, such as defective code. These threats can have a range of impacts, including allowing adversaries to take control of systems or decreasing the availability of materials needed to develop systems. These threats can be introduced by exploiting vulnerabilities that could exist at multiple points in the supply chain. Examples of such vulnerabilities include the acquisition of products or parts from unauthorized distributors; inadequate testing of software updates and patches; and incomplete information on IT suppliers. Malicious actors could exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal systems and the information they contain. GAO reported in 2012 that the four national security-related agencies in its review—the Departments of Defense, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security (DHS)—varied in the extent to which they had addressed supply chain risks. Of the four agencies, Defense had made the most progress addressing the risks. It had defined and implemented supply chain protection controls, and initiated efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the controls. Conversely, Energy and DHS had not developed or documented policies and procedures that defined security measures for protecting against IT supply chain threats and had not developed capabilities for monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. Although Justice had defined supply chain protection measures, it also had not developed or documented procedures for implementing or monitoring the measures. Energy and Justice fully implemented the recommendations that GAO made in its 2012 report and resolved the deficiencies that GAO had identified with their supply chain risk management efforts by 2016. DHS also fully implemented two recommendations to document policies and procedures for defining and implementing security measures to protect against supply chain threats by 2015, but could not demonstrate that it had fully implemented the recommendation to develop and implement a monitoring capability to assess the effectiveness of the security measures. In its 2012 report, GAO recommended that Justice, Energy, and DHS take eight actions, as needed, to develop and document policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities that address IT supply chain risk. The departments generally concurred with the recommendations and subsequently implemented seven recommendations and partially implemented the eighth recommendation."], "length": 3092, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "f91242d1926360ba71923587c1ba63e18d6a3ba749e6fbf6"}
{"input": "", "context": "From 2007 to 2015, HHS, DOL, and DOJ awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Specifically: HHS identified one grant program subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring for which nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients—the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, which is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Generally, only states are eligible to be primary recipients for PATH grant awards. However, HHS may award PATH grants directly to public or nonprofit entities if a state does not submit an application or does not meet program requirements. From this program, no grants were awarded to nonprofit organizations and therefore no FBOs were awarded grants. DOL identified 18 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring for which nonprofits were eligible to be primary recipients. All 18 of these grant programs were in DOL’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA). From these 18 programs, 931 grantees were awarded grants, including 19 we identified as potential FBOs. DOJ identified at least 34 relevant grant programs administered by OVW, COPS, and six different program offices within OJP that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. The 34 relevant grant programs represent the minimum number of grant programs that were subject to nondiscrimination provisions and for which nonprofit organizations were eligible from fiscal years 2007 through 2015. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher. As discussed below, OJP was unable to identify the total number of relevant grant programs and total number grantees awarded grants under these programs, including potential FBOs. More specifically within DOJ: OVW identified 20 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. From these 20 programs, 604 grantees were awarded grants, including 25 that OVW identified as potential FBOs. OJP identified at least 10 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. According to officials, OJP was not able to readily identify grant solicitations that were available to nonprofit organizations from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 and subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This effort, according to OJP, would have required a manual search of each grant solicitation. However, OJP was able to identify at least 10 grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious- based hiring. From these 10 programs, at least 1,113 grantees were awarded grants, including 74 we identified as potential FBOs. COPS identified four grant programs subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. From these four programs, 57 grantees were awarded grants, none of which were potential FBOs. Of the 117 potential FBOs we identified across the three agencies, nine faith-based grantees, all of which were awarded DOJ grants, certified that they were exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring (see figure 1). These 9 grantees were, therefore, allowed to consider a prospective employee’s religious faith when making employment decisions in connection with the grant. DOL and HHS reported that none of their grantees have sought exemptions from religious-based hiring provisions. As shown in Table 1, 8 of the 9 faith-based grantees that certified that they were exempt were awarded funding through DOJ grant programs from fiscal years 2008 to 2010. The remaining exempted grantee received a funding award in 2015. The total funding awarded to the 9 grantees was approximately $3.2 million, which is less than 1 percent of the $804 million in grants that DOJ awarded that are subject to statutory restrictions from fiscal years 2007 to 2015. DOJ reported that 8 of these grantees received the awards on a noncompetitive basis because they were identified for funding in a DOJ appropriation or accompanying committee report. We interviewed 6 of the 9 grantees that certified that they were exempt from religious-based hiring restrictions. Each of the 6 grantees that we interviewed stated that: hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs to assist with grant activities was critical to their mission and organizational success; they include a “statement of faith” on their organization’s job application form and ask the applicant to attest to the statement of faith, or hired individuals of the same faith already employed within their organization; and had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant or they would have had to seek executive- level approval within their organization to apply for the grant. At least 3 of the 6 grantees stated that they were a recipient of other federal grant funding, but those grants were not subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, and therefore did not require an exemption to make hiring decisions based on religion. Based on grant award documentation, 6 of the 9 grantees used the funding to provide assistance to at-risk youth. However, other services that the remaining grantees provided included first responder training and programs to reduce homelessness, among others, and support and response efforts for victims of sexual assault. As discussed earlier, we also selected 35 potential faith-based grantees that received funding in fiscal years 2014 and 2015 and that agencies reported had not filed a self-certification to be exempted from religious- based hiring restrictions. We interviewed 5 of these 35 grantees to discuss, among other things, whether the grantees were familiar with the exemption options. The five faith-based grantees said they did not recall seeing information about the exemption option in the grant application or grant award documentation, or were not looking for information about the exemption because they were not considering religion in their hiring decisions. Two of the faith-based grantees that did not certify as exempt told us that, while they ask that the applicant have an understanding of the traditions, culture, or languages of their religion, they do not require applicants to share the same faith. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions through grant announcements. The agencies also use additional methods that varied across all three agencies for providing this information to grantees. DOJ specifically made this information available on agency web pages as well as in the documentation that is provided to grant recipients. DOJ’s Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has a web page specifically for FBOs that have applied for or received grant funding. This web page includes a list of Frequently Asked Questions, including one that addresses hiring employees with federal grant funds. The Office for Civil Rights within OJP also provides information on its web page regarding how FBOs may certify that they are exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. Additionally, it includes a link to a copy of DOJ’s exemption certification form. We interviewed representatives from four potential faith-based grantees that received a DOJ grant in fiscal years 2014 or 2015 and did not certify for an exemption. All four grantees said they could not recall seeing information in the grant application or award documentation about the exemption option or were not looking for it because they were not considering religion in their hiring decisions. Similarly, DOL has a web page devoted specifically to explaining statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring to faith-based grant applicants and recipients, which also covers the process for seeking exemptions from the restrictions. The web page makes reference to DOL’s regulations related to religious-based hiring by FBOs and also has a link to the June 2007 OLC opinion. Additionally, DOL has prepared a guidance document—available from its grants program overview web page—that explains in detail the process for seeking exemptions and how they are reviewed and approved. A representative from the one potential FBO we interviewed that received a DOL grant in fiscal years 2014 or 2015 but did not certify that they were exempt could not recall seeing information about the exemption option. Lastly, in addition to providing information in grant announcements, HHS provides all SAMHSA grant applicants seeking funds for substance abuse prevention and treatment services with a form that cites laws and regulations governing religious organizations that receive SAMHSA funding, including the regulation that outlines the exemption process. HHS requires the applicants to sign the form, and in doing so, the applicants are certifying that they are aware of and will comply with applicable laws that allow FBOs to provide SAMHSA-funded services without impairing their religious character and without diminishing the religious freedom of those who receive their services. DOJ, DOL, and HHS all require grantees that seek to make employment decisions based on religion to self-certify that they meet requirements to be eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, but vary in how they review and approve requests for exemptions. DOJ faith-based grantees that wish to demonstrate they are eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring must complete and sign a “Certificate of Exemption for Hiring Practices on the Basis of Religion.” If an applicant is awarded a grant, it must submit a copy of the signed version of this form through DOJ’s Grants Management System. By signing the form, the grantee is certifying that: federally-funded services will be offered to all qualified beneficiaries without regard for the religious or nonreligious beliefs of those individuals; activities that contain inherently religious content will be kept separate from grant-related activities or offered to clients voluntarily; and the organization believes that the services provided are an expression of its religious beliefs, employing persons of a particular religion is important to its mission, and not being able to hire such persons would be a substantial burden to the organization. DOJ does not review these self-certification submissions to approve or deny the requests. It only reviews them for any indication that the applicant may not be an FBO, in which case DOJ officials said they would follow up with the grantee to get clarification. Agency officials also said DOJ would review any self-certifications as part of grantee compliance reviews and in response to complaints from other parties. The self- certification form covers the entire grant award period, and can cover multiple DOJ grants as long as all of the grant programs are subject to the same statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. There is no deadline for submitting the self-certification and DOJ officials told us that while it is understood that self-certifications should be submitted before grant funds are dispersed, grantees do not need to do so. DOL faith-based grantees that wish to demonstrate they are eligible for an exemption also self-certify, but are required to submit their request to DOL for review and approval by the Assistant Secretary responsible for issuing or administering the grant. In its request, the grantee must certify that: providing the services to be funded by the grant is an exercise of its without the grant, its ability to provide the services funded by the grant would be substantially diminished, and providing those services is demonstrably tied to the recipient’s religious beliefs; employing individuals of a particular religious belief is important to its religious identity, autonomy, or communal religious exercise; conditioning the grant award on compliance with the nondiscrimination provision creates substantial pressure on it, in providing the services being funded, to abandon its belief that hiring based on religion is important to its religious exercise; and it will comply with the requirements of 29 C.F.R. part 2, subpart D, Equal Treatment in Department of Labor Programs for Religious Organizations; Protection of Religious Liberty of Department of Labor Social Service Providers and Beneficiaries. The Assistant Secretary’s office then reviews exemption requests and approves them or provides a reason for denial. DOL has instituted a 30- day deadline to reply back to the grant applicant with its decision. DOL implemented this process in response to the 2007 OLC opinion. However, agency officials said they have never used this process because, as explained earlier in this report, DOL has not received any exemption requests. They also told us exemptions are only valid for the grant award period and new requests must be re-submitted if the grant is renewed. However, an exemption can cover multiple grants to the same grantee as long as those grants are received from the same DOL component. Lastly, the officials said that grant funds can be disbursed before the grantee has submitted an exemption request. HHS faith-based grantees seeking to demonstrate that they are eligible for an exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring must self-certify that they meet several requirements outlined in HHS regulations. To demonstrate its eligibility for an exemption, a grantee must certify that: it sincerely believes employing individuals of a particular religion is important to the definition and maintenance of its religious identity, autonomy, and/or communal religious exercise; it makes employment decisions on a religious basis in analogous programs; it believes the grant would materially affect its ability to provide the type of services in question; and providing the services in question is expressive of its values or mission. Grantees must then submit their self-certification to HHS requesting an exemption, and maintain supporting justification documentation on file if needed for future review. However, as explained earlier in this report, there is currently only one HHS grant program that is subject to a statutory restriction on religious-based hiring and for which FBOs are eligible to be primary recipients—the PATH program. We did not identify any faith-based recipients of grants from this program from fiscal years 2007 through 2015, and HHS officials confirmed that no nonprofit entities received any grants from the program during this time. We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Labor, Justice, and Health and Human Services.

In carrying out their mission, some FBOs prefer to hire individuals who share their religious beliefs. Although the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination based on religion, section 702(a) of the Act exempts FBOs from this prohibition, thereby allowing them to hire based on religion. However, some federal grant programs contain statutory restrictions prohibiting this practice. Since a 2007 DOJ legal opinion, federal agencies allow faith-based grantees to use RFRA as a basis for seeking an exemption to allow religious-based hiring. GAO was asked to review the extent to which faith-based grantees have sought RFRA exemptions from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. This report describes (1) what is known about faith-based grantees that have certified exemption from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring, per RFRA, since 2007; and (2) how agencies inform grantees of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and requirements for demonstrating their eligibility for an exemption. GAO reviewed information from DOJ, HHS, and DOL grantees from fiscal years 2007 to 2015 that were subject to statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed faith-based grantees that certified as exempt and a selection of those that did not. GAO also reviewed agency grant documentation and guidance provided to grantees and interviewed cognizant officials to understand the processes FBOs must follow to certify as exempt. From fiscal years 2007 through 2015, few faith-based grantees sought an exemption based on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) from nondiscrimination laws related to religious-based hiring. Specifically, GAO found that the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Department of Labor (DOL) awarded funding to at least 2,586 grantees through at least 53 grant programs containing nondiscrimination hiring restrictions during this time. The number of relevant grant programs could be higher, because GAO could not identify all such programs due to data limitations. Across the 3 agencies, GAO identified 117 grantees that were potential Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs). Of the 117 potential FBOs, 9 DOJ grantees were FBOs that certified as being exempt from statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring. GAO interviewed 6 of these FBOs, all of which stated that hiring individuals who share their religious beliefs was critical to their mission, and that had the RFRA exemption not been available to them, they likely would not have sought the grant. DOJ, DOL, and HHS inform grant applicants and recipients of statutory restrictions on religious-based hiring and processes for obtaining an exemption from such restrictions generally through grant materials. DOJ and DOL also provide relevant information on their web sites.

{"input": "", "context": "In our report, we found that, according to data from CBP’s Seized Asset and Case Tracking System (SEACATS), during fiscal years 2012 through 2016 CBP conducted about 308,000 seizures of inbound international items that may pose a threat to U.S. security, health and safety, business, and ecology. Of those, CBP seized about 70 percent from mail and 30 percent from express cargo. Seized items are categorized in SEACATS as either drugs or merchandise. Among the approximately 308,000 seizures, illegal or inadmissible drugs accounted for about 47 percent of total seizures and merchandise accounted for about 53 percent. According to testimony by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, a recent increase in deaths related to the synthetic opioid fentanyl has resulted in an increased focus on identifying methods by which traffickers bring fentanyl into the United States. In fiscal years 2012 through 2015, CBP’s seizure data reflect zero seizures of fentanyl, but according to CBP, fentanyl seizures would have been captured under other categories in SEACATS. According to CBP, a specific category code for fentanyl was added to SEACATS in fiscal year 2016. SEACATS reflects 53 seizures of fentanyl in fiscal year 2016 via both mail and express cargo. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both USPS and express consignment operators provide items to CBP for inspection. Express consignment operators accept items for delivery to the United States at points of sale in foreign countries and provide EAD to CBP prior to the items’ scheduled arrival in the United States. CBP then analyzes the EAD and provides lists of targeted items to express consignment operators. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with EAD for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement. According to USPS data, USPS received EAD for about one third of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail) for the period from April 2016 through March 2017. For the month of March 2017 (the most recent data available at the time of our review), USPS data indicate that EAD was available for roughly half of all inbound international mail (excluding letters, flats, and military/diplomatic mail). In 2014 and 2015, USPS and CBP initiated two pilot programs at the New York International Service Center (ISC) to target certain mail for inspection using some of the EAD obtained under data-sharing agreements with foreign postal operators. At the time of our review, CBP did not use EAD to target mail for inspection outside of these pilots. According to USPS documents, the goal of these pilots is to test the effectiveness of placing holds on mail that has been targeted by CBP based on EAD. Under the pilots, CBP uses EAD to target a small number of pieces of mail each day. According to USPS officials, when USPS employees scan either individual targeted pieces or larger sacks containing this targeted mail, they are alerted that CBP has targeted the item and set the item or sack aside for inspection. Since the pilots began, USPS has made efforts to locate and provide CBP with the targeted mail and CBP has collected performance data on the percentage of targeted mail USPS has provided for inspection: about 82 percent for one pilot, and about 58 percent for the other. In our report we note that, according to USPS and CBP, USPS has been unable to provide some targeted mail for inspection because locating targeted mail once it arrives at an ISC has been a challenge. Specifically, USPS ISCs may receive thousands of large sacks of mail per day that are scanned as they are accepted. Each sack may contain hundreds of pieces of mail that are not individually scanned upon arrival. As a result, locating a targeted item requires manually sorting through the entire sack, and USPS employees may overlook the item while sorting through the larger sack to locate targeted mail. According to USPS officials, at the time of our review they were testing an automated method to identify targeted mail within these larger sacks. Standards for internal control in the federal government state that defining program goals in specific and measurable terms allows for the assessment of performance toward achieving objectives. However, while USPS and CBP have collected some performance information for these pilots (including the percentage of targeted mail provided for inspection), this information is not linked to a specific performance target agreed upon by USPS and CBP—such as a specific percentage of targeted mail provided to CBP for inspection. Further, the agencies have not conducted an analysis to determine if the pilot programs are achieving desired outcomes. In our report, we concluded that, because CBP and USPS lack clear performance goals for these pilots, they risk spending additional time and resources expanding them prior to fully assessing the pilots’ success or failure. As such, we recommended that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, (1) establish measureable performance goals for pilot programs and (2) assess the performance of the pilots in achieving these goals. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018. In our report we found that the costs and benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection are unclear. For example, according to USPS and CBP officials, increasing the use of EAD to target mail for inspection may have benefits, such as reducing the volume of inspected mail and increasing the percentage of inspections that result in identification of a threatening or illegal item. This potential outcome could decrease time and resources needed for the screening process—potentially decreasing costs—and may increase the security of inbound mail. However, the costs of collecting and implementing the use of EAD are not yet known, and neither USPS nor CPB currently collect the data necessary to know whether using EAD might increase the security of inbound mail or decrease the time and costs associated with screening. Specifically, regarding the costs of collecting EAD, USPS has not calculated the current costs of collecting EAD from countries with which it has data-sharing agreements, but officials stated that USPS does not incur significant additional costs for each new designated postal operator or type of mail for which it begins collecting EAD. While some of the costs of obtaining EAD may be borne by designated postal operators in other countries, rather than directly by USPS, costs to USPS to use EAD to target mail for inspection may include: equipment and personnel required to identify targeted mail (such as equipment required to sort through hundreds of pieces of mail to identify a single piece of mail), and software upgrades required to exchange data with foreign postal operators and with CBP. In our report we found that an analysis of the costs associated with planned efforts is particularly critical given USPS’s financial challenges. As we recently found, USPS reported a net loss of $5.6 billion in fiscal year 2016—its 10th consecutive year of net losses. In light of this situation, any expenditure of financial resources to make any additional infrastructure and information technology upgrades necessary to implement the use of EAD for targeting merit careful consideration. Beyond costs, in our report we also determined that USPS and CBP have not performed an analysis of the benefits of using EAD to target mail for inspection, including the effectiveness of targeted inspection based on EAD relative to other methods of selecting mail for inspection. Thus, the extent to which targeting based on EAD might result in an increased ability to identify threats or other benefits over current methods is unknown. For example, CBP has collected data on the percentage of inspections resulting in a seizure for mail inspected as a result of targeting in the pilot programs at the New York ISC. However, CBP does not collect comparable data for seizures resulting from inspections conducted based on current methods of choosing mail for inspection. Moreover, USPS and CBP experience challenges related to inspecting mail that may limit their ability to effectively use EAD to target mail for screening and, thus, to experience EAD’s possible benefits. For example, USPS depends on foreign postal operators to make EAD available. According to USPS and State Department officials, however, those operators may not share the same security priorities as USPS and CBP and may not make EAD available. If the amount of available EAD remains limited for inbound mail, this may reduce the effectiveness of CBP’s targeting efforts or could constrain CBP’s ability to reduce the volume of mail it inspects. Our prior work has found that in designing preventive measures—such as the screening of inbound mail to identify potential threats—it is helpful to conduct a thorough assessment of vulnerabilities as well as cost-benefit analyses of alternative strategies. In the absence of information on the relative costs of various methods of selecting mail for inspection as well as their effectiveness at identifying potential threats in inbound mail, USPS and CBP are unable to fully understand whether obtaining additional EAD for targeting purposes will provide security or resource benefits. In our report, we therefore concluded that, particularly in light of the challenges that collecting and using these data present, it is important that CBP and USPS carefully consider actions to enhance inbound international mail security to avoid wasting time and money on potentially ineffective and costly endeavors. As such, we recommended that CBP, in conjunction with USPS, evaluate the relative costs and benefits of collecting EAD for targeting mail for inspection in comparison to other methods. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with this recommendation and plans to implement it by February 28, 2018. In conclusion, existing pilots could be used as an opportunity for CBP and USPS to: (1) articulate performance goals for the pilots, (2) collect data and assess the pilots on their success in enabling USPS to provide targeted mail to CBP for inspection, and (3) assess the costs and benefits of various methods of choosing mail for inspection. We are encouraged that USPS and the Department of Homeland Security agreed with our findings and recommendations. Effective implementation of our recommendations should help CBP and USPS ensure that efforts to collect and use EAD to target mail for inspection achieve the desired security and resource benefits.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the primary federal agency tasked with targeting and inspecting inbound international items and seizing illegal goods, including illegal or inadmissible drugs and merchandise. As mail and express cargo arrive in the United States, both the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and express consignment operators (such as FedEx and DHL) provide items to CBP for inspection. However, unlike express consignment operators, USPS is not currently required to provide CBP with electronic advance data (EAD), such as the shipper's and recipient's name and address, for inbound international mail and does not have control over mail prior to its arrival in the United States. Thus, USPS relies on foreign postal operators to collect and provide EAD voluntarily or by mutual agreement.

{"input": "", "context": "This report provides background information and issues for Congress on the John Lewis (TAO-205) class oiler shipbuilding program, a program to build a new class of 20 fleet oilers for the Navy. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. Issues for Congress regarding the TAO-205 program include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy. Decisions that Congress makes regarding the program could affect Navy capabilities and funding requirements and the U.S. shipbuilding industrial base. For an overview of the strategic and budgetary context in which the TAO-205 program and other Navy shipbuilding programs may be considered, see CRS Report RL32665, Navy Force Structure and Shipbuilding Plans: Background and Issues for Congress , by Ronald O'Rourke. The primary role of Navy fleet oilers is to transfer fuel to Navy surface ships that are operating at sea, so as to extend the operating endurance of these surface ships and their embarked aircraft. Fleet oilers also provide other surface ships with lubricants, fresh water, and small amounts of dry cargo. Fleet oilers transfer fuel and other supplies to other surface ships in operations called underway replenishments (UNREPs). During an UNREP, an oiler steams next to the receiving ship and transfers fuel by hose (see Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 ). Oilers are one kind of Navy UNREP ship; other Navy UNREP ships include ammunition ships, dry cargo ships, and multiproduct replenishment ships. The Navy's UNREP ships are known more formally as the Navy's combat logistics force (CLF). Most of the Navy's CLF ships are operated by the Military Sealift Command (MSC). Navy oilers carry the designation TAO (sometimes written as T-AO). The T means that the ships are operated by MSC with a mostly civilian crew; the A means it is an auxiliary ship of some kind; and the O means that it is, specifically, an oiler. Although the role of fleet oilers might not be considered as glamorous as that of other Navy ships, fleet oilers are critical to the Navy's ability to operate in forward-deployed areas around the world on a sustained basis. The U.S. Navy's ability to perform UNREP operations in a safe and efficient manner on a routine basis is a skill that many other navies lack. An absence of fleet oilers would significantly complicate the Navy's ability to operate at sea on a sustained basis in areas such as the Western Pacific or the Indian Ocean/Persian Gulf region. The Navy states that the ability to rearm, refuel and re-provision our ships at sea, independent of any restrictions placed on it by a foreign country, is critical to the Navy's ability to project warfighting power from the sea. As the lifeline of resupply to Navy operating forces underway, the ships of the Navy's Combat Logistic Force (CLF) enable Carrier Strike Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups to operate forward and remain on station during peacetime and war, with minimal reliance on host nation support. The Navy's existing force of fleet oilers consists of 15 Henry J. Kaiser (TAO-187) class ships ( Figure 4 ). These ships were procured between FY1982 and FY1989 and entered service between 1986 and 1996. They have an expected service life of 35 years; the first ship in the class will reach that age in 2021. The ships are about 677 feet long and have a full load displacement of about 41,000 tons, including about 26,500 tons of fuel and other cargo. The ships were built by Avondale Shipyards of New Orleans, LA, a shipyard that eventually became part of the shipbuilding firm Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII). HII subsequently wound down Navy shipbuilding operations at Avondale, and the facility no longer builds ships. (HII continues to operate two other shipyards that build Navy ships.) The TAO-205 class program was originally called the TAO(X) program, with the (X) meaning that the exact design of the ship had not yet been determined. On January 6, 2015, then-Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced that ships in the class will be named for \"people who fought for civil rights and human rights,\" and that the first ship in the class, TAO-205, which was procured in FY2016, will be named for Representative John Lewis. The class consequently is now known as the John Lewis (TAO-205) class. As part of its goal for achieving a fleet of 355 ships, the Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205 class ships. The required number of oilers largely depends on the numbers and types of other surface ships (and their embarked aircraft) to be refueled, and the projected operational patterns for these ships and aircraft. The first TAO-205 class ship was procured in FY2016, the second in FY2018, and the third and fourth in FY2019. The Navy's FY2020 five-year (FY2020-FY2023) shipbuilding plan calls for procuring the next seven ships in the class in annual quantities of 2-1-1-2-1. The Navy's FY2020 30-year (FY2020-FY2049) shipbuilding plan calls for procuring the remaining nine ships in the program at a rate of one per year starting in FY2025. The first TAO-205 is scheduled for delivery in November 2020. Table 1 shows procurement funding for the TAO-205 program in the Navy's FY2020 budget submission. The Navy's FY2020 budget submission estimates the total procurement cost of the 20 planned TAO-205s at $12,196.1 million (i.e., about 12.2 billion) in then-year dollars, or an average of $609.8 million each. Since the figure of $12,196.1 million is in then-year dollars, it incorporates estimated annual inflation rates for TAO-205s to be procured out to FY2033. The TAO-205 class design ( Figure 5 ) will have capabilities similar to those of the Kaiser-class ships, and will rely on existing technologies rather than new technologies. To guard against oil spills, TAO-205s are to be double-hulled, like modern commercial oil tankers, with a space between the two hulls to protect the inner hull against events that puncture the outer hull. (The final Kaiser-class ships are double-hulled, but earlier ships in the class are single-hulled.) TAO-205s are being built by General Dynamics/National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (GD/NASSCO) of San Diego, CA, a shipyard that builds Navy auxiliaries and DOD sealift ships. On June 25, 2015, the Navy, as part of its acquisition strategy for TAO-205 program, issued a combined solicitation consisting of separate Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for the detailed design and construction (DD&C) of the first six TAO-205s; the DD&C in FY2017 (and also procurement of long lead-time materials in FY2016) for an amphibious assault ship called LHA-8 that the Navy procured in FY2017; and contract design support for the LPD-17 Flight II program (previously called the LX[R] program), a program to procure a new class of 13 amphibious ships. The Navy limited bidding in this combined solicitation to two bidders—Ingalls Shipbuilding of Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII/Ingalls) and GD/NASSCO—on the grounds that these are the only two shipbuilders that have the capability to build both TAO-205s and LHA-8. Under the Navy's plan for the combined solicitation, one of these two yards was to be awarded the DD&C contract for the first six TAO-205s, the other yard was to be awarded the DD&C contract (and procurement of long lead-time materials) for LHA-8, and the shipyard with the lowest combined evaluated price was to receive a higher profit on its DD&C contract and was to be awarded the majority of the LPD-17 Flight II contract design engineering man-hours. On June 30, 2016, the Navy announced its awards in the above-described combined solicitation, awarding a fixed price incentive block buy contract for the DD&C of the first six TAO-205s to GD/NASSCO. (The Navy awarded the contract for the DD&C of LHA-8 to HII/Ingalls. HII/Ingalls was also awarded the majority of the LPD-17 Flight II contract design engineering man-hours.) The Navy was granted authority for using a block buy contract to procure the first six TAO-205s by Section 127 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015). It was earlier estimated that the block buy contract would reduce the procurement cost of the second through sixth TAO-205s by an average of about $45 million each, compared to costs under the standard or default DOD approach of annual contracting. The Navy states that about $35 million of the $45 million in per-ship savings will come from using advance procurement (AP) funding for batch-ordering TAO-205 components. The Navy states that this use of AP funding could have occurred under annual contracting, and that the savings that are intrinsic to the block buy contract are thus about $10 million per ship. Section 8117 of the FY2019 Appropriations Act (Division A of H.R. 6157 / P.L. 115-245 of September 28, 2018) states the following: Sec. 8117. None of the funds provided in this Act for the TAO Fleet Oiler program shall be used to award a new contract that provides for the acquisition of the following components unless those components are manufactured in the United States: Auxiliary equipment (including pumps) for shipboard services; propulsion equipment (including engines, reduction gears, and propellers); shipboard cranes; and spreaders for shipboard cranes. The Appendix presents the Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) assessment of the TAO-205 class program from GAO's annual report surveying DOD major acquisition programs. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the 5th and 6th ships in the program. The Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the two ships at $1,056.3 million, or an average of $528.1 million each. The two ships have received $75.0 million in prior-year advance procurement (AP) funding, and the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $981.2 million in procurement funding needed to complete the two ships' estimated combined procurement cost. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget also requests $73.0 million in AP funding for TAO-205s to be procured in future fiscal years, and $3.7 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding to cover cost growth on TAO-205s procured in prior fiscal years, bringing the total FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program (aside from outfitting and post-delivery costs) to $1,057.9 million. One issue for Congress is whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program. In assessing this issue, Congress may consider, among other things, whether the Navy has accurately priced the work that it is requesting to fund in FY2020. Another issue for Congress concerns the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations. The Navy is implementing a new operational concept, called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO), that could lead to the development of a fleet with larger numbers of individually smaller ships, and to more-widely dispersed Navy operations. DMO could affect requirements for Navy logistics, including oilers. The Navy states that Recapitalizing the auxiliary and sealift fleet in support of DMO has become a top priority. The initial reviews of the requirements to support this operational maritime concept indicate potential growth across the five lines of effort: refuel, rearm, resupply, repair, and revive. Coincident is the review of the level of effort needed to distribute logistics into a contested maritime environment following safe transfer by the logistics fleet—smaller, faster, multi-mission transports likely resident within the future battle force. The work to fully flesh out the requirement is ongoing, but the aggregate is expected to be no less than the current requirement, reinforcing the urgency to recapitalize the current fleet. An August 2017 GAO report states the following: The readiness of the surge sealift and combat logistics fleets has trended downward since 2012. For example, GAO found that mission-limiting equipment casualties—incidents of degraded or out-of-service equipment—have increased over the past 5 years, and maintenance periods are running longer than planned, indicating declining materiel readiness across both fleets.... The Navy has not assessed the effects of widely distributed operations, which could affect the required number and type of combat logistics ships. The Navy released its new operational concept of more widely distributed operations—ships traveling farther distances and operating more days to support a more distributed fleet—in 2017. The Navy has not assessed the effects that implementing this concept will have on the required number and type of combat logistics ships. These effects could be exacerbated in the event that the Navy is less able to rely on in-port refueling—which has comprised about 30 percent of all refuelings over the past 3 years—placing greater demand on the combat logistics fleet. Given the fleet's dependence on the combat logistics force, waiting until 2019 or 2020 to conduct an assessment, as planned, could result in poor investment decisions as the Navy continues to build and modernize its fleet. Furthermore, without assessing the effects of widely distributed operations on logistics force requirements and modifying its force structure plans accordingly, the Navy risks being unprepared to provide required fuel and other supplies. Another issue for Congress is whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy. The issue relates to how changes in the international security environment might affect how the Navy operates and equips its underway replenishment ships. During the Cold War, the Navy procured underway replenishment ships to support a two-stage approach to underway replenishment in which single-product \"shuttle\" ships (such as oilers, ammunition ships, and dry stores ships) would take their supplies from secure ports to relatively safe midocean areas, where they would then transfer them to multiproduct \"station\" ships called TAOEs and AORs. The TAOEs and AORs would then travel to Navy carrier strike groups operating in higher-threat areas and transfer their combined supplies to the carrier strike group ships. As a result, single-product shuttle ships were equipped with lesser amounts of ship self-defense equipment, and TAOEs and AORs were equipped with greater amounts of such equipment. When the Cold War ended and transitioned to the post-Cold War era, threats to U.S. Navy ships operating at sea were substantially reduced. As a consequence, the amount of ship self-defense equipment on the TAOEs and AORs was reduced, and a single-stage approach to underway replenishment, in which oilers and dry stores ships took supplies from secure ports all the way to carrier strike group ships, was sometimes used. Now that the post-Cold War era has transitioned to a new strategic environment featuring renewed great power competition with countries like China and Russia, and a consequent renewal of potential threats to U.S. Navy ships operating at sea, the question is whether TAO-205s should be equipped with lesser amounts of ship self-defense equipment, like oilers were during both the Cold War and post-Cold War eras, or with greater amounts of ship self-defense equipment, like TAOEs and AORs were during the Cold War. Building TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy could increase TAO-205 procurement costs by tens of millions of dollars per ship, depending on the amount of additional ship self-defense equipment. Section 1026 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( S. 1356 / P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015) required an independent assessment of the Navy's combat logistics force ships. The report was delivered to Congress in February 2016. A copy of the report was posted by the media outlet Politico on March 11, 2016. The report states the following: The T-AO(X) will only have a limited capability to defeat a submarine launched torpedo attack and no capability to defeat a missile attack. When delivered, the TAO(X) will have: —[the] NIXIE Torpedo Countermeasure System [for decoying certain types of torpedoes] —[the] Advanced Degaussing System (Anti-Mine) [for reducing the ship's magnetic signature, so as to reduce the likelihood of attack by magnetically fused mines] When required, the T-AO(X) will also have ability to embark Navy Expeditionary Combat Command Expeditionary Security Teams (EST). The ESTs will embark with several crew served weapons and are designed to provide limited self-defense against a small boat attack. The T-AO(X) will have Space, Weight, Power and Cooling (SWAP-C) margins for future installations of the following systems: —[the] Close In Weapon System (CIWS) or SeaRAM (Rolling Airframe Missile) [for defense against missile attack] —[the] Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) [for destroying torpedoes] Even after the installation of a CIWS or ATTDS, if the T-AO(X) was to operate in anything other than a benign environment, the ship will require both air and surface escorts. The decision to rely on [other] Fleet assets to provide force protection [i.e., defense against attacks] for the T-AO(X) was validated by the JROC [in June 2015]. Table 2 summarizes congressional action on the Navy's request for FY2020 procurement funding for the TAO-205 program. A May 2019 GAO report—the 2019 edition of GAO's annual report surveying DOD major acquisition programs—stated the following regarding the TAO-205 program: Technology Maturity and Design Stability The Navy has matured all Lewis class critical technologies and stabilized the ships' design. In 2014, the Navy identified three critical technologies for the Lewis class, all of which involved a new system for transferring cargo at sea. Prior to initiating detail design activities in June 2016, the Navy completed prototype tests of the critical technologies and found that they were fully mature—an approach consistent with shipbuilding best practices. In 2017, the Navy removed one critical technology—the Heavy e-STREAM cargo delivery system—from the Lewis class design. The Navy had intended to use this system to deliver F-35 Lightning II power modules. The Navy subsequently decided to deliver these by air, which precluded any need for the Heavy system. Lead ship construction began in September 2018 with 95 percent of the ship's total design effort complete. Program officials stated that this figure meant that 100 percent of the ship's basic and functional design were by then complete—an approach consistent with best practices. Throughout detail design and now into construction, the Navy has not changed the Lewis class program's performance requirements. The Navy also leveraged commercial vessel designs to minimize design and construction risks. The Lewis class features a modern double-hull construction, an environmental-based design standard for commercial tankers, to ensure the ships can dock at ports-of-call. This design was included in the final three Kaiser class oilers. Production Readiness The program office has largely kept to its construction schedule to date for the first ship, but a flooding incident at a NASSCO graving dock in July 2018 has affected the delivery of future ships. The program office stated that this incident has not affected current ship fabrication activities. However, the dock's unavailability while repairs are planned and implemented has disrupted the contractor's schedule for future ships. According to the program office, the incident has resulted in some delays to certain delivery dates for ships two through six. Other Program Issues As part of the Navy's plan to expand the fleet, the Navy concluded that it would need an additional three Lewis class ships. The Navy's budget request for fiscal year 2019 increased its planned one-ship-per-year buy to two for fiscal years 2019, 2021, and 2023. The Congress provided appropriations for the additional fiscal year 2019 ship in support of the Navy's request. To account for the additional ships in fiscal years 2019 and 2021, the Navy plans to add two more ships to the low-rate initial production phase. Subsequently, program officials stated that they plan to compete a new contract for the remaining 12 ships using the construction knowledge gained from efforts under the existing contract. Program Office Comments We provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and comment. The program office provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. The program office stated that it continues to follow GAO shipbuilding best practices and has leveraged commercial vessel design practices to minimize risk. The program office also stated that it is currently revising its acquisition baseline to reflect the update in total quantities to 20 ships. In addition, the program office noted that, in fiscal year 2019, it fully funded the third and fourth ships and funded advance procurement for the fifth ship.", "answers": ["The Navy began procuring John Lewis (TAO-205) class oilers in FY2016, and a total of four have been procured through FY2019, including two in FY2019. The first six ships are being procured under a block buy contract that was authorized by Section 127 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1356/P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015). The Navy wants to procure a total of 20 TAO-205s. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the procurement of the fifth and sixth ships in the program. The Navy estimates the combined procurement cost of the two ships at $1,056.3 million, or an average of $528.1 million each. The two ships have received $75.0 million in prior-year advance procurement (AP) funding, and the Navy's proposed FY2020 budget requests the remaining $981.2 million in procurement funding needed to complete the two ships' estimated combined procurement cost. The Navy's proposed FY2020 budget also requests $73.0 million in AP funding for TAO-205s to be procured in future fiscal years, and $3.7 million in cost-to-complete procurement funding to cover cost growth on TAO-205s procured in prior fiscal years, bringing the total FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program (aside from outfitting and post-delivery costs) to $1,057.9 million. Issues for Congress include the following: whether to approve, reject, or modify the Navy's FY2020 procurement funding request for the TAO-205 program; the number of oilers the Navy will require in coming years to support its operations; and whether to encourage or direct the Navy to build TAO-205s with more ship self-defense equipment than currently planned by the Navy."], "length": 3632, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "54da2503ef9cd61e98fc39ba742772c8a15311d72ab94a08"}
{"input": "", "context": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is a joint federal-state program financed by federal payroll taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and by state payroll taxes under State Unemployment Tax Acts (SUTA). These revenues are deposited into the appropriate account within the federal Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other goals, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues. At the same time, UC program spending falls because fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes while decreasing spending on benefits dampens demand in the economy. It also creates a surplus of funds, or a reserve fund , for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. These reserve balances are credited in the state's account within the UTF. During an economic slowdown or recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of lost earnings by injecting additional funds into the economy. States levy their own payroll taxes (SUTA) on employers to fund regular UC benefits and the state share (50%) of the Extended Benefit (EB) program. Federal laws and regulations provide broad guidelines for these state taxes. Each state deposits its SUTA revenue into its account within the UTF. SUTA revenue finances UC benefits. Generally, when economic activity is robust and increasing, SUTA revenue is greater than a state's UC expenditures. As a result, the state's reserves within the UTF grow. This trend is reversed during economic recessions and during the early economic recovery period, when the state's reserves are drawn down and new SUTA revenue does not always make up the shortfall. If the recession is deep enough and if SUTA revenue is inadequate for long periods of time, states may have insufficient funds to pay for UC benefits. Federal law, which requires states to pay these benefits, provides a loan mechanism within the UTF framework that an insolvent state may opt to use to meet its UC benefit payment obligations. States must pay back these loans. If the loans are not paid back quickly (depending on the timing of the beginning of the loan period), states may face interest charges and the states' employers may face increased net FUTA rates until the loans are repaid. In the years immediately following the most recent recession, many states had insufficient SUTA revenue and UTF account balances to pay UC benefits. All FUTA revenue is deposited into the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) within the UTF. Federal unemployment taxes pay for the federal share of EB (50%) and for administrative grants to the states. Additionally, through the federal loan account within the UTF, FUTA funds may be loaned to insolvent states to assist the payment of the states' UC obligations. FUTA imposes a 6.0% gross federal unemployment tax rate on the first $7,000 paid annually by employers to each employee. Employers in states with programs approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary and with no outstanding federal loans may credit up to 5.4 percentage points of state unemployment taxes paid against the 6.0% tax rate, making the minimum net federal unemployment tax rate 0.6%. Because most employees earn more than the $7,000 taxable wage ceiling in a calendar year, the FUTA tax typically is $42 per worker per year ($7,000 × 0.6%), or just over 2 cents per hour for a full-time, year-round worker. States have a great deal of autonomy in how they establish and run their unemployment insurance programs. However, the framework established by federal laws is clear and requires states to promptly pay the UC benefits as provided under state law. In budgetary terms, UC benefits are an entitlement (although the program is financed by a dedicated tax imposed on employers and not by general revenue). Thus, even if a recession hits a given state and, as a result, that state's trust fund account is depleted, the state remains legally required to continue paying benefits. To do so, the state might borrow money either from the dedicated loan account within the UTF or from outside sources. If the state chooses to borrow funds from the UTF, not only will the state be required to continue paying benefits, it also will be required to repay the funds (plus any interest due) it has borrowed from the federal loan account within a few years. Such states may need to raise taxes on their employers or reduce UC benefit levels, actions that dampen economic growth, job creation, and consumer demand. In short, states have strong incentives to keep adequate funds in their trust fund accounts. If the state borrows from sources outside the UTF, the state would not be subject to the loan restrictions described below. Instead, the state would be subject to the terms within that outside loan agreement, which might offer a different (more favorable) interest rate or repayment schedule but may include fees to establish the loan. The Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) is the federal loan account within the UTF. The FUA is primarily funded from the statutory transfer of excess revenue from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) being deposited into the FUA. If needed, the FUA may borrow funds from other federal accounts within the UTF or from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. From FY2009 to FY2015, the FUA had to borrow funds from the U.S. Treasury to finance loans to the state accounts. 1. Revenue from additional FUTA taxes paid by employers when a reduced credit against federal unemployment taxes exists because the state has an outstanding unpaid loan from FUA is deposited into the FUA. (See the discussion below on \" Federal Tax Increases on Outstanding Loans Through Credit Reductions \" for a more detailed explanation of these additional taxes.) 2. Federal law allows the FUA to borrow available funds from the other federal (EUCA and ESAA) accounts within the UTF. 3. Federal law also authorizes appropriations as loans from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury if balances in the federal accounts are insufficient to cover their expenditures. (For example, if the states' borrowing needs exceed the available FUA balance.) Such appropriations require discretionary action by Congress and the President. Once a state recognizes that it does not have sufficient funds to pay UC benefits, the mechanism for receiving a loan from the UTF is straightforward. The state's governor (or the governor's designee) must submit a letter requesting that the U.S. Labor Secretary advance funds to the state account within the UTF. Once the loan is approved by the U.S. Labor Secretary, the funds are placed into the state account in monthly increments. States with outstanding loans from the UTF must repay them fully by the November 10 following the second consecutive January 1 on which the state has an outstanding loan. If the outstanding loan is not repaid by that time, the state will face an effective federal tax increase. Thus, a state may have approximately 22 months (if borrowing began on January 1) to 34 months (if borrowing began on January 2) to repay the loan without a federal tax increase, depending on when it obtained the outstanding loan. As of January 29, 2019, approximately $68.3 million in federal UTF loans to the states were outstanding. A current list of states with outstanding loans may be found at the Department of Labor's (DOL's) website, https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/budget.asp . If the state does not repay a loan by November 10 of the second year, the state becomes subject to a reduction in the amount of state unemployment tax credit applied against the federal unemployment tax beginning with the preceding January 1 until the state repays the loan fully. Depending on the duration of the loan and certain other measures, one or more of three different credit reductions may be required. These reductions are fully catalogued in Table 1 . At the height of the period following the most recent recession (2011), 20 states and the Virgin Islands faced increased FUTA rates because of outstanding UTF loans. The credit reduction is initially a 0.3 percentage point reduction for the year beginning with the calendar year in which the second consecutive January 1 passes during which the loan is outstanding and increases by a 0.3 percentage point reduction for each year there is an outstanding loan. For example, in the first year, the credit reduction results in the net federal tax rate increasing from 0.6% to 0.9%—an additional $21 for each employee; in the second year, it would increase to 1.2%—a cumulative additional $42 for each employee. Two potential other credit reductions exist (in addition to the cumulative 0.3 percentage point increases) during the ensuing calendar years in which a state has an outstanding loan: 1. Beginning in the third year, the 2.7 add-on uses a statutory formula that takes into consideration the average annual wages and average employment contribution rate. 2. Beginning in the fifth year, the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) add-on replaces the 2.7 add-on and uses the five-year benefit-cost rate as well as average wages in its calculation. Table 1 presents these reductions and the subsequent net FUTA tax faced by state employers as a result of these unpaid loans. If any January 1 passes without an outstanding balance, the year count starts over with the next loan. DOL maintains a list of potential reduced credit states at http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/docs/reduced_credit_states.xlsx . Section 272 of P.L. 97-248 allows a delinquent state the option of repaying—on or before November 9—a portion of its outstanding loans each year through transfer of a specified amount from its account in the UTF to the FUA. If the state complies with all the requirements listed below, the potential credit reduction is avoided (there is no reduction): The state must repay all loans for the most recent one-year period ending on November 9, plus the potential additional taxes that would have been imposed for the tax year based upon a state tax credit reduction. The state must have sufficient amounts in the state account of the UTF to pay all compensation for the last quarter of that calendar year without receiving a loan. The state also must have altered its state law to increase the net solvency of its account with the UTF. From 2011 through 2014, South Carolina met these requirements. As a result, employers in South Carolina were not subject to a state tax credit reduction in the calculation of their FUTA taxes. (Generally, employers in South Carolina would have paid more in state unemployment taxes to meet these requirements.) Once a state begins to have a credit reduction, the state may apply to have the reductions capped if the state meets four criteria: No legislative or other action in 12 months ending September 30 has been taken to decrease the state's unemployment tax effort. (A state cannot actively decrease its expected state unemployment tax revenue from current law.) No legislative or other action has been taken to decrease the net solvency of the state's trust fund account. (For example, the state would not be allowed to actively increase the average UC benefit amount from current law requirements.) Average state unemployment tax rate on total wages must exceed the five-year average benefit-cost rate on total wages. Balance of outstanding loans as of September 30 must not be greater than the balance three years before. The BCR add-on may be waived if the Secretary of Labor determines the state did not take legislative or other actions to decrease the net solvency of the state's trust fund account. The 2.7 add-on would then replace the BCR add-on. The additional federal taxes attributable to the credit reduction are applied against the state's outstanding UTF loan. Thus, although technically employers are paying additional FUTA taxes, the additional tax pays off a state's debt. The state's employers will pay the additional federal taxes resulting from the credit reduction no later than January 31 of the next calendar year. Since April 1, 1982 ( P.L. 97-35 as amended), states have been charged interest on new loans that are not repaid by the end of the fiscal year in which they were obtained. (Before April 1, 1982, states could receive these loans interest free.) The interest is the same rate as that paid by the federal government on state reserves in the UTF for the quarter ending December 31 of the preceding year but not higher than 10% per annum. The interest rate for calendar year loans is determined by Section 1202(b)(4) of the Social Security Act. The interest rate for a calendar year is the earnings yield on the UTF for the quarter ending December 31 of the previous calendar year. The U.S. Treasury Department calculated the fourth-quarter earnings yield in 2018 to be 2.3081%. Thus, loans made in calendar year 2019 are subject to an interest rate of 2.3081%. States may not pay the interest directly or indirectly from SUTA revenue or funds in their state account within the UTF. If a state does not repay the interest, or if it pays the interest with funds from SUTA taxes, DOL is required by federal law to refuse to certify that state's program as being in compliance with federal law. Not being in compliance with federal unemployment law would mean that the state would not be eligible to receive administrative grants and employers in that state would not receive the state unemployment tax credit in the calculation of their federal unemployment taxes. States may borrow funds without interest from the UTF during the year. To receive these interest-free loans, the states must meet five conditions: 1. The states must repay the loans by September 30. 2. For those repaid (by September 30) loans to maintain their interest-free status, there cannot be any loans made to that state in October, November, or December of the calendar year of such an interest-free loan. If loans are made in the last quarter of the calendar year, the \"interest-free\" loans made in the previous fiscal year will retroactively accrue interest charges. 3. The states must meet funding goals relating to their account in the UTF, established under regulations issued by DOL. In addition to these first three requirements, the phase-in of two new requirements began in 2014. The full effect of the requirements began in 2019. 4. States must have had at least one year in the past five calendar years before the year in which advances are taken in which the Average High Cost Multiple (AHCM) was greater than or equal to 1.0. 5. Additionally, states must meet two criteria for maintenance-of-tax effort in every year from the most recent year the AHCM was at least 1.0 and the year in which loans are taken. a. The average state unemployment tax rate (total state unemployment tax amount collected over total taxable wages) was at least 80% of the prior year's rate. b. The average state unemployment tax rate was at least 75% of the average benefit-cost ratio over the preceding five calendar years, where the benefit-cost ratio for a year is defined as the amount of benefits and interest paid in the year divided by the total covered wages paid in the year. Table 2 lists outstanding state loans. (At this time, only the U.S. Virgin Islands has an outstanding loan.) The table also includes information on accrued interest payments for FY2019.

{"input": "", "context": "FCC has not evaluated Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals but, as we found in May 2017, has taken recent steps toward evaluation. According to GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, to use public funds effectively the government must meet the demands of today’s changing world by employing effective management practices and processes, including the measurement of government program performance. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. For example, FCC specified that it would review USAC 1 year after USAC was appointed as the permanent administrator to determine whether the universal service programs were being administered effectively. This review, which was planned to have been completed by 1999, was never done. In 2005, FCC awarded a contract to the National Academy of Public Administration to study the administration of the USF programs generally, examine the tradeoffs of continuing with the current structure, and identify ways to improve the oversight and operation of universal service programs. However, we reported in May 2017 that FCC officials stated FCC subsequently terminated the contract and the study was not conducted. In March 2015, we found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline’s effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. We recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. Our May 2017 report raised additional questions about Lifeline’s effectiveness in meeting its program goals. For example, we reported that: FCC did not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service (for which they pay out of pocket) along with their Lifeline benefit. Without knowing whether participants are using Lifeline as a primary or secondary phone service, we concluded that it is difficult for FCC to determine whether it is achieving the program’s goal of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the USF contribution burden. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption and generally phase out phone service, in part because FCC recognized that most eligible consumers have phones without Lifeline and to also close the “digital divide” of broadband adoption between low-income households and the rest of the country. However, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. We found that at least two companies operating in a total of at least 21 states had begun offering in-home non-Lifeline broadband wireline support for less than $10 per month to individuals that participate in public- assistance programs, such as SNAP or public housing. The offered rate of these providers’ own low-income broadband service of $10 per month was less expensive than FCC’s broadband reasonable- comparability cost benchmark of approximately $55 per month, which Lifeline subscribers would be paying for a similar level of service. Our May 2017 report also found that FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals. Specifically, in the 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline’s design, function, and administration. The order stipulated the outside evaluator must complete the evaluation and USAC must submit the findings to FCC by December 2020. As FCC expects Lifeline enrollment to increase as the program is expanded to include broadband service, this expansion could carry with it increased risks for fraud, waste, and abuse, as was the case with past expansions of the program. Completing the program evaluation as planned, and as we recommended in 2015, would help FCC determine whether Lifeline is meeting its stated goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income consumers, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. In our May 2017 report we found that FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, we found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers’ telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. To address these concerns, we recommended the Chairman of FCC (1) require Commissioners to review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling, so customer bills are transparent, and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, we found that USAC’s banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds—whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion—outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advice provided in April 2000. OMB had concluded that the USF does not constitute public money subject to the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302, a statute that requires that money received for the use of the United States be deposited in the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by law. As such, USF balances are held in a private bank account. However, subsequent to this OMB advice, in February 2005 we reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. As discussed in our May report, according to correspondence we received from the FCC Chairman’s Senior Legal Counsel, as of March 2017, FCC had decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury. For example, FCC explained that having the funds in the Treasury would provide USAC with better tools for fiscal management of the funds, including access to real- time data and more accurate and transparent data. According to FCC, until the USF is moved into the Treasury, there are also some oversight risks associated with holding the fund in a private account. For example, the contract governing the account does not provide FCC with authority to direct bank activities with respect to the funds in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator of the USF. After we raised this matter with FCC officials during the course of our review, beginning in November 2016, FCC sought to amend the contract between USAC and the bank to enable the bank to act on FCC instructions independently of USAC in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator. However, as of May 2017, the amended contract had not yet been signed. While FCC has put in place a preliminary plan to move the USF funds to the Treasury, as well as plans to amend the existing contract with the bank as an interim measure, several years have passed since this issue was brought to FCC’s attention without corrective actions being implemented. Further, under FCC’s preliminary plan, it would not be until next year, at the earliest, that the funds would be moved to the Treasury. In May 2017, while reviewing a draft of this report, a senior FCC official informed us that FCC experienced some challenges associated with moving the funds to the Treasury, such as coordinating across the various entities involved, which raised some questions as to when and perhaps whether the funds would be moved. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. As a result, in our May 2017 report, we recommended that the Chairman of FCC take action to ensure that the preliminary plans to transfer the USF funds from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented as expeditiously as possible. FCC agreed with this recommendation. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the NLAD database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline- supported services. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, our analysis of data from 2014, as well as our undercover attempts to obtain Lifeline service, revealed significant weaknesses in subscriber eligibility verification. Lifeline providers are generally responsible for verifying the eligibility of potential subscribers, but we found that their ability to do so is hindered by a lack of access to, or awareness of, state eligibility databases that can be used to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment. For example, not all states have databases that Lifeline providers can use to confirm eligibility and some providers with whom we spoke were unaware of databases that were potentially available to them. These challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. Additionally, since USAC was not maintaining and providing information to providers about these databases, we recommended they maintain and disseminate an updated list of state eligibility databases available to Lifeline providers that includes the qualifying programs those databases access to confirm eligibility, to help ensure Lifeline providers are aware of state eligibility databases and USAC audits of Lifeline providers can verify that available state databases are being utilized to verify subscriber eligibility. FCC agreed with the recommendation. For our May 2017 report, to identify Lifeline subscribers who were potentially ineligible to participate in the program, we tested the eligibility of subscribers who claimed participation in Medicaid, SNAP, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) using NLAD data as of November 2014. We focused our analysis on these three programs because FCC reported in 2012 that these were the three qualifying programs through which most subscribers qualify for Lifeline. We compared approximately 3.4 million subscribers who, according to information entered in NLAD, were eligible for Lifeline due to enrollment in one of these three programs to eligibility data for these programs. On the basis of our analysis of NLAD and public-assistance data, we could not confirm that a substantial portion of selected Lifeline beneficiaries were enrolled in the Medicaid, SNAP, and SSI programs, even though, according to the data, they qualified for Lifeline by stating on their applications that they participated in one of these programs. In total, we were unable to confirm whether 1,234,929 subscribers out of the 3,474,672 who we reviewed, or about 36 percent, participated in the qualifying benefit programs they stated on their Lifeline enrollment applications or were recorded as such by Lifeline providers. If providers claimed and received reimbursement for each of the 1.2 million subscribers, then the subsidy amount associated with these individuals equals $11.4 million per month, or $137 million annually, at the current subsidy rate of $9.25 per subscriber. Because Lifeline disbursements are based on providers’ reimbursement claims, not the number of subscribers a provider has in NLAD, our analysis of NLAD data could not confirm actual disbursements associated with these individuals. Given that our review was limited to those enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid in selected case-study states, and SSI in states that participated in NLAD at the time of our analysis, our data results are likely understated compared to the entire population of Lifeline subscribers. These results indicate that potential improper payments have occurred and have gone undetected. We plan to refer potentially ineligible subscribers identified through our analysis for appropriate action as warranted. Our undercover testing, as discussed in our May 2017 report, also found that Lifeline may be vulnerable to ineligible subscribers obtaining service and the testing found examples of Lifeline providers being nonresponsive, or providing inaccurate information. To conduct our 21 tests, we contacted 19 separate providers to apply for Lifeline service. We applied using documentation fictitiously stating that we were enrolled in an eligible public-assistance program or met the Lifeline income requirements. We were approved to receive Lifeline services by 12 of the 19 Lifeline providers using fictitious eligibility documentation. We also experienced instances during our undercover tests where our calls to providers were disconnected, and where Lifeline provider representatives transmitted erroneous information, or were unable to provide assistance on questions about the status of our application. For example, one Lifeline provider told us that our application was not accepted by the company because our signature had eraser marks; however our application had been submitted via an electronic form on the provider’s website and was not physically signed. While our tests are illustrative and not representative of all Lifeline providers or applications submitted, these results suggest that Lifeline providers do not always properly verify eligibility and that applicants may potentially encounter similar difficulties when applying for Lifeline benefits. As described above, these challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. FCC and USAC have implemented some mechanisms to enhance oversight of Lifeline providers, as discussed in our May 2017 report, but we found that remaining gaps could allow noncompliance with program rules. For example, in July 2014, FCC took additional measures to combat fraud, waste, and abuse by creating a strike force to investigate violations of USF program rules and laws. According to FCC, the creation of the strike force is part of the agency’s commitment to stopping fraud, waste, and abuse and policing the integrity of USF programs and funds. Similarly, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. However, we found FCC and USAC have limited oversight of Lifeline provider operations and the internal controls used to manage those operations. The current structure of the program relied throughout 2015 and 2016 on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers (ETC) to provide Lifeline service to eligible beneficiaries. These companies are relied on to not only provide telephone service, but also to create Lifeline applications, train employees and subcontractors, and make eligibility determinations for millions of applicants. USAC’s reliance on Lifeline providers to determine eligibility and subsequently submit accurate and factual invoices is a significant risk for allowing potentially improper payments to occur, and under current reporting guidelines these occurrences would likely go undetected and unreported. Federal internal control standards state that management retains responsibility for the performance and processes assigned to service organizations performing operational functions. Consistent with internal control standards, FCC and USAC would need to understand the extent to which a sample of these internal controls are designed and implemented effectively to ensure these controls are sufficient to address program risks and achieve the program’s objectives. We identified key Lifeline functions for which FCC and USAC had limited visibility. For example, we found instances of Lifeline providers utilizing domestic or foreign-operated call centers for Lifeline enrollment. When we asked FCC officials about Lifeline providers that outsource program functions to call centers, including those overseas, they told us that such information is not tracked by FCC or USAC. With no visibility over these call centers, FCC and USAC do not have a way to verify whether such call centers comply with Lifeline rules. FCC and USAC have limited knowledge about potentially adverse incentives that providers might offer employees to enroll subscribers. For example, some Lifeline providers pay commissions to third-party agents to enroll subscribers, creating a financial incentive to enroll as many subscribers as possible. Companies responsible for distributing Lifeline phones and service that use incentives for employees to enroll subscribers for monetary benefit increase the possibility of fictitious or ineligible individuals being enrolled into Lifeline. Highlighting the extent of the potential risk for companies, in April 2016 FCC announced approximately $51 million in proposed fines against one Lifeline provider, due to, among other things, its sales agents purposely enrolling tens of thousands of ineligible and duplicate subscribers in Lifeline using shared or improper eligibility documentation. To test internal controls over employees associated with Lifeline for our May 2017 report, we sought employment with a company that enrolls individuals to Lifeline. We were hired by a company and were allowed to enroll individuals in Lifeline without ever meeting any company representatives, conducting an employment interview, or completing a background check. After we were hired, we completed two fictitious Lifeline applications as an employee of the company, successfully enrolled both of these fictitious subscribers into Lifeline using fabricated eligibility documentation, and received compensation for these enrollments. The results of these tests are illustrative and cannot be generalized to any other Lifeline provider. We plan to refer this company for appropriate action as warranted. As stated above, these challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. In addition, in May 2017, we made two recommendations to help address control weaknesses and related program-integrity risks. Specifically, we recommended that FCC establish time frames to evaluate compliance plans and develop instructions with criteria for FCC reviewers how to evaluate these plans to meet Lifeline’s program goals. We also recommended that FCC develop an enforcement strategy that details what violations lead to penalties and apply this as consistently as possible to all Lifeline providers to ensure consistent enforcement of program violations. FCC generally agreed with these recommendations. In conclusion, Lifeline’s large and diffuse administrative structure creates a complex internal control environment susceptible to significant risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. FCC’s and USAC’s limited oversight of important aspects of program operations further complicates the control environment—heightening program risk. We are encouraged by FCC’s recent steps to address weaknesses we identified, such as the 2016 order establishing a National Verifier, which, if implemented as planned, could further help to address weaknesses in the eligibility-determination process. We also plan to monitor the implementation status of the recommendations we made in May 2017. Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks.

Lifeline reimburses telephone companies that offer discounts through the USF, which in turn is generally supported by consumers by means of a fee charged on their telephone bills. This testimony is based on GAO's May 2017 report and discusses steps FCC has taken to measure Lifeline's performance in meeting goals; steps FCC and USAC have taken to enhance controls over finances, subscribers, and providers; and any weaknesses that might remain. For the May 2017 report, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FCC and USAC. GAO also analyzed subscriber data from 2014 and performed undercover tests to identify potential improper payment vulnerabilities. The results of this analysis and testing are illustrative, not generalizable. In its May 2017 report, GAO found the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not evaluated the Lifeline program's (Lifeline) performance in meeting its goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income households by providing financial support, but it has recently taken steps to begin to do so. FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "length": 3956, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fa5a9d9cd641dccda7580dc34bdcc204b4adf85d2fd0004f"}
{"input": "", "context": "FCC has not evaluated Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals but, as we found in May 2017, has taken recent steps toward evaluation. According to GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, to use public funds effectively the government must meet the demands of today’s changing world by employing effective management practices and processes, including the measurement of government program performance. In the past, FCC has called for program evaluations to review the administration of universal service generally, including Lifeline, but has not completed such evaluations. For example, FCC specified that it would review USAC 1 year after USAC was appointed as the permanent administrator to determine whether the universal service programs were being administered effectively. This review, which was planned to have been completed by 1999, was never done. In 2005, FCC awarded a contract to the National Academy of Public Administration to study the administration of the USF programs generally, examine the tradeoffs of continuing with the current structure, and identify ways to improve the oversight and operation of universal service programs. However, we reported in May 2017 that FCC officials stated FCC subsequently terminated the contract and the study was not conducted. In March 2015, we found that FCC had not evaluated Lifeline’s effectiveness in achieving its performance goals of ensuring the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. We recommended, and FCC agreed, to conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which Lifeline is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals. Our May 2017 report raised additional questions about Lifeline’s effectiveness in meeting its program goals. For example, we reported that: FCC did not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service (for which they pay out of pocket) along with their Lifeline benefit. Without knowing whether participants are using Lifeline as a primary or secondary phone service, we concluded that it is difficult for FCC to determine whether it is achieving the program’s goal of increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers while minimizing the USF contribution burden. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption and generally phase out phone service, in part because FCC recognized that most eligible consumers have phones without Lifeline and to also close the “digital divide” of broadband adoption between low-income households and the rest of the country. However, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. We found that at least two companies operating in a total of at least 21 states had begun offering in-home non-Lifeline broadband wireline support for less than $10 per month to individuals that participate in public- assistance programs, such as SNAP or public housing. The offered rate of these providers’ own low-income broadband service of $10 per month was less expensive than FCC’s broadband reasonable- comparability cost benchmark of approximately $55 per month, which Lifeline subscribers would be paying for a similar level of service. Our May 2017 report also found that FCC has recently taken some steps toward evaluating Lifeline’s performance in meeting program goals. Specifically, in the 2016 Lifeline Modernization Order, FCC instructed USAC to hire an outside, independent, third-party evaluator to complete a program evaluation of Lifeline’s design, function, and administration. The order stipulated the outside evaluator must complete the evaluation and USAC must submit the findings to FCC by December 2020. As FCC expects Lifeline enrollment to increase as the program is expanded to include broadband service, this expansion could carry with it increased risks for fraud, waste, and abuse, as was the case with past expansions of the program. Completing the program evaluation as planned, and as we recommended in 2015, would help FCC determine whether Lifeline is meeting its stated goals of increasing telephone and broadband subscribership among low-income consumers, while minimizing the burden on those who contribute to the USF. In our May 2017 report we found that FCC and USAC have established financial controls for Lifeline, including obtaining and reviewing information about billing, collecting, and disbursing funds. They have also developed plans to establish other controls, such as establishing a national eligibility verifier (National Verifier) for Lifeline providers to determine the eligibility of applicants seeking Lifeline service. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, we found that weaknesses remain, including the lack of requirements to effectively control program expenditures above approved levels, concerns about the transparency of fees on customers’ telephone bills, and a lack of FCC guidance that could result in Lifeline and other providers paying inconsistent USF contributions. To address these concerns, we recommended the Chairman of FCC (1) require Commissioners to review and approve, as appropriate, spending above the budget in a timely manner; (2) require a review of customer bills as part of the contribution audit to include an assessment of whether the charges, including USF fees, meet FCC Truth-in-billing rules with regard to labeling, so customer bills are transparent, and appropriately labeled and described, to help consumers detect and prevent unauthorized changes; and (3) respond to USAC requests for guidance and address pending requests concerning USF contribution requirements to ensure the contribution factor is based on complete information and that USF pass-through charges are equitable. FCC generally agreed with those recommendations. In addition, we found that USAC’s banking practices for the USF result in oversight and accountability risks that FCC has plans to mitigate. Specifically, FCC maintains USF funds—whose net assets as of September 2016 exceeded $9 billion—outside of the U.S. Treasury pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advice provided in April 2000. OMB had concluded that the USF does not constitute public money subject to the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute, 31 U.S.C. § 3302, a statute that requires that money received for the use of the United States be deposited in the Treasury unless otherwise authorized by law. As such, USF balances are held in a private bank account. However, subsequent to this OMB advice, in February 2005 we reported that FCC should reconsider this determination in light of the status of universal service monies as federal funds. As discussed in our May report, according to correspondence we received from the FCC Chairman’s Senior Legal Counsel, as of March 2017, FCC had decided to move the funds to the Treasury. FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds to the Treasury. For example, FCC explained that having the funds in the Treasury would provide USAC with better tools for fiscal management of the funds, including access to real- time data and more accurate and transparent data. According to FCC, until the USF is moved into the Treasury, there are also some oversight risks associated with holding the fund in a private account. For example, the contract governing the account does not provide FCC with authority to direct bank activities with respect to the funds in the event USAC ceases to be administrator of the USF. After we raised this matter with FCC officials during the course of our review, beginning in November 2016, FCC sought to amend the contract between USAC and the bank to enable the bank to act on FCC instructions independently of USAC in the event USAC ceases to be the administrator. However, as of May 2017, the amended contract had not yet been signed. While FCC has put in place a preliminary plan to move the USF funds to the Treasury, as well as plans to amend the existing contract with the bank as an interim measure, several years have passed since this issue was brought to FCC’s attention without corrective actions being implemented. Further, under FCC’s preliminary plan, it would not be until next year, at the earliest, that the funds would be moved to the Treasury. In May 2017, while reviewing a draft of this report, a senior FCC official informed us that FCC experienced some challenges associated with moving the funds to the Treasury, such as coordinating across the various entities involved, which raised some questions as to when and perhaps whether the funds would be moved. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. As a result, in our May 2017 report, we recommended that the Chairman of FCC take action to ensure that the preliminary plans to transfer the USF funds from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented as expeditiously as possible. FCC agreed with this recommendation. FCC and USAC have implemented controls to improve subscriber eligibility verification, such as implementing the NLAD database in 2014, which helps carriers identify and resolve duplicate claims for Lifeline- supported services. However, as discussed in our May 2017 report, our analysis of data from 2014, as well as our undercover attempts to obtain Lifeline service, revealed significant weaknesses in subscriber eligibility verification. Lifeline providers are generally responsible for verifying the eligibility of potential subscribers, but we found that their ability to do so is hindered by a lack of access to, or awareness of, state eligibility databases that can be used to confirm eligibility prior to enrollment. For example, not all states have databases that Lifeline providers can use to confirm eligibility and some providers with whom we spoke were unaware of databases that were potentially available to them. These challenges might be overcome if FCC establishes a National Verifier, as it plans to do nationwide by the end of 2019, to remove responsibility for verifying eligibility from the providers. Additionally, since USAC was not maintaining and providing information to providers about these databases, we recommended they maintain and disseminate an updated list of state eligibility databases available to Lifeline providers that includes the qualifying programs those databases access to confirm eligibility, to help ensure Lifeline providers are aware of state eligibility databases and USAC audits of Lifeline providers can verify that available state databases are being utilized to verify subscriber eligibility. FCC agreed with the recommendation. For our May 2017 report, to identify Lifeline subscribers who were potentially ineligible to participate in the program, we tested the eligibility of subscribers who claimed participation in Medicaid, SNAP, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) using NLAD data as of November 2014. We focused our analysis on these three programs because FCC reported in 2012 that these were the three qualifying programs through which most subscribers qualify for Lifeline. We compared approximately 3.4 million subscribers who, according to information entered in NLAD, were eligible for Lifeline due to enrollment in one of these three programs to eligibility data for these programs.

If providers claimed and received reimbursement for each of the 1.2 million subscribers, then the subsidy amount associated with these individuals equals $11.4 million per month, or $137 million annually, at the current subsidy rate of $9.25 per subscriber. Because Lifeline disbursements are based on providers’ reimbursement claims, not the number of subscribers a provider has in NLAD, our analysis of NLAD data could not confirm actual disbursements associated with these individuals. Given that our review was limited to those enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid in selected case-study states, and SSI in states that participated in NLAD at the time of our analysis, our data results are likely understated compared to the entire population of Lifeline subscribers.

FCC does not know how many of the 12.3 million households receiving Lifeline as of December 2016 also have non-Lifeline phone service, or whether participants are using Lifeline as a secondary phone service. FCC revamped Lifeline in March 2016 to focus on broadband adoption; however, broadband adoption rates have steadily increased for the low-income population absent a Lifeline subsidy for broadband. Without an evaluation, which GAO recommended in March 2015, FCC is limited in its ability to demonstrate whether Lifeline is efficiently and effectively meeting its program goals. In a March 2016 Order, FCC announced plans for an independent third party to evaluate Lifeline design, function, and administration by December 2020. FCC and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC)—the not-for-profit organization that administers the Lifeline program—have taken some steps to enhance controls over finances and subscriber enrollment. For example, FCC and USAC established some financial and management controls regarding billing, collection, and disbursement of funds for Lifeline. To enhance the program's ability to detect and prevent ineligible subscribers from enrolling, FCC oversaw completion in 2014 of an enrollment database and, in June 2015, FCC adopted a rule requiring Lifeline providers to retain eligibility documentation used to qualify consumers for Lifeline support to improve the auditability and enforcement of FCC rules. Nevertheless, in its May 2017 report, GAO found weaknesses in several areas. For example, Lifeline's structure relies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key program functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibility. This complex internal control environment is susceptible to risk of fraud, waste, and abuse as companies may have financial incentives to enroll as many customers as possible. On the basis of its matching of subscriber to benefit data, GAO was unable to confirm whether about 1.2 million individuals of the 3.5 million it reviewed, or 36 percent, participated in a qualifying benefit program, such as Medicaid, as stated on their Lifeline enrollment application. FCC's 2016 Order calls for the creation of a third-party national eligibility verifier by the end of 2019 to determine subscriber eligibility. Further, FCC maintains the Universal Service Fund (USF)—with net assets of $9 billion, as of September 2016—outside the Department of the Treasury in a private bank account. In 2005, GAO recommended that FCC reconsider this arrangement given that the USF consists of federal funds. In addition to addressing any risks associated with having the funds outside the Treasury, FCC identified potential benefits of moving the funds. For example, by having the funds in the Treasury, USAC would have better tools for fiscal management of the funds. In March 2017, FCC developed a preliminary plan to move the USF to the Treasury. Until FCC finalizes and implements its plan and actually moves the USF funds, the risks that FCC identified will persist and the benefits of having the funds in the Treasury will not be realized. In its May 2017 report, GAO made seven recommendations, including that FCC ensure plans to transfer the USF from the private bank to the Treasury are finalized and implemented expeditiously. FCC generally agreed with all the recommendations."], "length": 3955, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2562c68308e254c936f0c6e40ef0cd6136e98adb74ed8651"}
{"input": "", "context": "S ince the 1970s, policymakers have increasingly used the tax code to promote energy policy goals. Long-term energy policy goals include providing a secure supply of energy, providing energy at a low cost, and ensuring that energy production and consumption is consistent with environmental objectives. A range of federal policies, including various research and development programs, mandates, and direct financial support such as tax incentives or loan guarantees, promotes various energy policy objectives. This report focuses on tax incentives that support the production of or investment in various energy resources. Through the mid-2000s, the majority of revenue losses associated with energy tax incentives were from provisions benefiting fossil fuels. At present, the balance has shifted, such that the bulk of federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions are from incentives for renewable energy production and investment. While there has been growth in the amount of energy from renewable resources, the majority of domestic energy produced continues to be from fossil energy resources. This has raised questions regarding the value of energy tax incentives relative to production and the relative subsidization of various energy resources. Although the numbers in this report may be useful for policymakers evaluating the current status of energy tax policy, it is important to understand the limitations of this analysis. This report evaluates energy production relative to the value of current energy tax expenditures. It does not, however, seek to analyze whether the current system of energy tax incentives is economically efficient, effective, or otherwise consistent with broader energy policy objectives. Further, analysis in this report does not include information on federal spending on energy that is not linked to the tax code. The following sections estimate the value of tax incentives relative to the level of energy produced using fossil and renewable energy resources. Before proceeding with the analysis, some limitations are outlined. The analysis itself requires quantification of energy production and energy tax incentives. Once data on energy production and energy tax incentives have been presented, the value of energy tax incentives can be evaluated relative to current levels of energy production. The analysis below provides a broad comparison of the relative tax support for fossil fuels as compared with the relative support for renewables. Various data limitations prevent a precise analysis of the amount of subsidy per unit of production across different energy resources. Limitations associated with this type of analysis include the following: Current-year tax incentives may not directly support current-year production . Many of the tax incentives available for energy resources are designed to encourage investment, rather than production. For example, the expensing of intangible drilling costs (IDCs) for oil and gas provides an incentive to invest in capital equipment and exploration. Although the ability to expense IDCs does not directly support current production of crude oil and natural gas, such subsidies are expected to increase long-run supply. Differing levels of federal financial support may or may not reflect underlying policy rationales . Various policy rationales may exist for federal interventions in energy markets. Interventions may be designed to achieve various economic, social, or other policy objectives. Although analysis of federal financial support per unit of energy production may help inform the policy debate, it does not directly consider why various energy sources may receive different levels of federal financial support. Tax expenditures are estimates . The tax expenditure data provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) are estimates of federal revenue losses associated with specific provisions. These estimates do not provide information on actual federal revenue losses, nor do these estimates reflect the amount of revenue that would be raised should the provision be eliminated. Additionally, the JCT advises that tax expenditures across provisions not be summed, due to interaction effects. Tax expenditure data are not specific to energy source . Many tax incentives are available to a variety of energy resources. For example, the tax expenditure associated with the expensing of IDCs does not distinguish between revenue losses associated with natural gas versus those associated with oil. The tax expenditure for five-year accelerated depreciation also does not specify how much of the benefit accrues to various eligible technologies, such as wind and solar. A number of tax provisions that support energy are not energy specific . The U.S. energy sector benefits from a number of tax provisions that are not targeted at energy. For example, the production activities deduction (Section 199), before being repealed in the 2017 tax act ( P.L. 115-97 ), benefited all domestic manufacturers. For the purposes of the Section 199 deduction, oil and gas extraction was considered a domestic manufacturing activity. Certain energy-related activities may also benefit from other tax incentives that are available to non-energy industries, such as the ability to issue tax-exempt debt, the ability to structure as a master limited partnership, or tax incentives designed to promote other activities, such as research and development. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual data on U.S. primary energy production. EIA defines primary energy as energy that exists in a naturally occurring form, before being converted into an end-use product. For example, coal is considered primary energy, which is typically combusted to create steam and then electricity. This report relies on 2017 data on U.S. primary energy production (see Table 1 ). In 2017, most primary energy was produced using fossil fuels. Natural gas was the largest source of primary energy production, accounting for 32.0% of primary energy produced. Crude oil accounted for 22.1% of U.S. primary energy production in 2017, and coal accounted for 17.7%. Taken together, fossil energy sources were used for 77.7% of 2017 primary energy production. The remaining U.S. primary energy production is attributable to nuclear electric and renewable energy resources. Overall, 9.5% of 2017 U.S. primary energy was produced as nuclear electric energy. Renewables (including hydroelectric power) constituted 12.8% of 2017 U.S. primary energy production. Biomass was the largest source of primary production among the renewables in 2017, accounting for 5.9% of overall primary energy production and 46.1% of renewable energy production. This was followed by hydroelectric power at 3.1% and wind energy at 2.7% of primary energy production. Solar energy and geothermal energy were responsible for 0.9% and 0.2%, respectively, of 2017 primary energy production (see Table 1 ). Primary energy produced using biomass can be further categorized as biomass being used to produce biofuels (e.g., ethanol) and biomass being used to generate biopower. Of the 5.2 quadrillion Btu of energy produced using biomass, about 2.3 quadrillion Btu was used in the production of biofuels. The tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives only available for the energy industry. In addition to targeted tax incentives, the energy sector may also benefit from a number of broader tax provisions that are available for energy- and non-energy-related taxpayers. These broader tax incentives are not included in the analysis, since tax expenditure estimates do not indicate how much of the revenue loss associated with these generally available provisions is associated with energy-related activities. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) tax expenditure estimates are used to tabulate federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions. The tax expenditure estimates provided by the JCT are forecasted revenue losses. These revenue losses are not reestimated on the basis of actual economic conditions. Thus, revenue losses presented below are projected, as opposed to actual revenue losses. The JCT advises that individual tax expenditures cannot be simply summed to estimate the aggregate revenue loss from multiple tax provisions. This is because of interaction effects. When the revenue loss associated with a specific tax provision is estimated, the estimate is made assuming that there are no changes in other provisions or in taxpayer behavior. When individual tax expenditures are summed, the interaction effects may lead to different revenue loss estimates. Consequently, aggregate tax expenditure estimates, derived from summing the estimated revenue effects of individual tax expenditure provisions, are unlikely to reflect the actual change in federal receipts associated with removing various tax provisions. Thus, total tax expenditure figures presented below are an estimate of federal revenue losses associated with energy tax provisions, and should not be interpreted as actual federal revenue losses. Table 2 provides information on revenue losses and outlays associated with energy-related tax provisions in FY2017 and FY2018. The FY2017 figures are included to facilitate comparison with the primary energy production using different energy resources. Since the tax code was substantially changed beginning in 2018, FY2018 tax expenditures are also included. In 2017, the tax code provided an estimated $17.8 billion in support for the energy sector. More than one-third of the 2017 total, $6.4 billion, was due to the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC). Nine different provisions supporting fossil fuels had an estimated cost of $4.6 billion, collectively, in 2017. This declined to $3.2 billion for 2018. While the tax legislation enacted late in 2017 ( P.L. 115-97 ) did not directly change fossil-fuel-related tax provisions, other changes, including the reduced corporate tax rate, lowered the tax savings associated with various tax incentives for fossil fuels. While the majority of federal tax-related support for energy in 2017 can be attributed to either fossil fuels or renewables, provisions supporting energy efficiency, alternative technology vehicles, and nuclear energy also resulted in forgone revenue in 2017 and 2018. Table 3 provides a side-by-side comparison of fossil fuel and renewable production, along with the cost of tax incentives supporting fossil fuel and renewable energy resources. During 2017, 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production could be attributed to fossil fuel sources. Of the federal tax support targeted to energy in 2017, an estimated 25.8% of the value went toward supporting fossil fuels. During 2017, an estimated 12.8% of U.S. primary source energy was produced using renewable resources. Of the federal tax support targeted to energy in 2017, an estimated 65.2% went toward supporting renewables. Table 3 also contains information on subcategories of renewables, specifically (1) renewables excluding hydro and (2) renewables excluding biofuels. Excluding hydro might be instructive since current energy production is the result of past investment decisions, some of which may not have benefited from targeted tax incentives. Thus, it may not always be appropriate to compare the current value of tax incentives to current levels of energy production. For example, energy generated using hydroelectric power technologies might be excluded from the renewables category, as most existing hydro-generating capacity was installed before the early 1990s. Thus, there is no current federal tax benefit for most electricity currently generated using hydropower. Further, with many of the best hydro sites already developed, there is limited potential for growth in conventional hydropower capacity. There is, however, potential for development of additional electricity-generating capacity through smaller hydro projects that could substantially increase U.S. hydroelectric generation capacity. Excluding hydro from the renewables category, or removing an energy resource where the development was not likely supported by current renewables-related tax incentives, nonhydro renewables accounted for 9.7% of 2017 primary energy production (see Table 3 ). During 2017, certain tax expenditures for renewable energy did, however, benefit taxpayers developing and operating hydroelectric power facilities. Certain hydroelectric installations, including efficiency improvements or capacity additions at existing facilities, may be eligible for the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). Given that hydro is supported by 2017 tax expenditures, one could also argue that for the purposes of the comparison being made in this report, hydro should be included in the renewables category. It may also be instructive to consider incentives that generally support renewable electricity separately from those that support biofuels. Of the estimated $17.8 billion in energy tax provisions in 2017, an estimated $2.1 billion, or 11.8%, went toward supporting biofuels. Excluding tax incentives for biofuels, 53.4% of energy-related tax incentives in 2017 were attributable to renewables. In other words, excluding biofuels from the analysis reduces the share of tax incentives attributable to renewables from 65.2% to 53.4% (see Table 3 ). Excluding biofuels from the analysis also reduces renewables' share of primary energy production. When biofuels are excluded, the share of primary energy produced in 2017 attributable to renewables falls by 2.7 percentage points, from 12.8% to 10.1% ( Table 3 ). In 2017, 9.5% of primary energy produced was from nuclear resources. The one tax benefit for nuclear with a positive tax expenditure in 2017 was the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. At $0.2 billion in 2017, this was 1.7% of the value of all tax expenditures for energy included in the analysis. Like many other energy-related tax expenditures, the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds is not directly related to current energy production. Instead, this provision reduces the cost of investing in nuclear energy by taxing income from nuclear decommissioning reserve funds at a preferred rate (a flat rate of 20%). Over time, there have been substantial shifts in the proportion of energy-related tax expenditures benefiting different types of energy resources. Figure 1 illustrates the projected value of energy-related tax incentives since 1978. Energy tax provisions are categorized as primarily benefiting fossil fuels, renewables, renewable fuels, efficiency, vehicles, or some other energy purpose. Until the mid-2000s, most of the value of energy-related tax incentives supported fossil fuels. Starting in the mid-2000s, the cost of energy-related tax preferences supporting renewables increased. Some of this increase was attributable to provisions supporting renewable fuels, which have since expired. From the 1980s through 2011, most of the tax-related federal financial support for renewable energy was for renewable fuels, mainly alcohol fuels (i.e., ethanol). The tax credits for alcohol fuels (including ethanol) expired at the end of 2011. Starting in 2008, the federal government incurred outlays associated with excise tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Under current law, the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel expired at the end of 2017. Thus, after FY2018 (which includes the end of calendar year 2017), there are no projected costs associated with tax incentives for renewable fuels. Expired tax incentives may be extended, however, as part of the \"tax extenders.\" Beginning in the mid-2000s, the cost of energy tax incentives for renewables began to increase. Beginning in 2009, the Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits contributed to increased costs associated with tax-related benefits for renewable energy. Through 2014, Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits exceeded tax expenditures associated with the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) combined. The Section 1603 grant option is not available for projects that began construction after December 31, 2011. However, since grants are paid out when construction is completed and eligible property is placed in service, outlays under the Section 1603 program continued through 2017. Tax expenditures for the ITC and PTC have increased substantially in recent years. As a result of the extensions for wind and solar enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ), ITC and PTC tax expenditures are projected to remain stable for several years. Under current law, the PTC will not be available to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2019. However, since the PTC is available for the first 10 years of renewable electricity production, and the expiration date is a start-of-construction deadline as opposed to a placed-in-service deadline, PTC tax expenditures will continue after the provision expires. The ITC for solar, currently 30%, is scheduled to decline to 26% for property beginning construction in 2020, and 22% for property beginning construction in 2021, before returning to the permanent rate of 10% after 2021. Thus, absent additional policy changes, the higher tax expenditures associated with the PTC and ITC are expected to be temporary. Tax expenditures for tax incentives supporting energy efficiency increased in the late 2000s, but subsequently declined. Most of the increase in revenue losses for efficiency-related provisions was associated with tax incentives for homeowners investing in certain energy-efficient property. The primary tax incentive for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes expired at the end of 2017. Extension of expired tax incentives for energy efficiency would increase the cost of energy efficiency-related tax incentives. As was noted above, many energy-related tax provisions, particularly those that support renewables, are temporary. Over time as these incentives phase out, tax expenditures associated with these provisions will decline. This process may take some time. For the PTC, for example, the credit is claimed during the first 10 years of qualifying production. It is possible that qualifying production begins after the December 31, 2019, start-of-construction expiration date, meaning that tax expenditures for the PTC are expected to continue for at least the next decade. U.S. Department of the Treasury tax expenditure estimates can be used to illustrate how expiring provisions affect the distribution of energy-related tax expenditures over time (see Figure 2 ). Treasury and JCT tax expenditure estimates differ in a number of ways. The Treasury provides tax expenditures over an 11-year budget window. The JCT uses a shorter 5-year window. The JCT and Treasury also use different methodologies when preparing tax expenditure estimates, and have different classifications as to what provisions constitute tax expenditures. Thus, the tax expenditure estimates prepared by each entity are not directly comparable. However, looking at Treasury tax expenditure estimates over time can illustrate broader trends regarding which types of energy are receiving tax-related benefits. In 2018, according to Treasury's tax expenditure estimates, tax expenditures supporting renewables totaled an estimated $8.4 billion. By 2028, that number is expected to decline to $3.5 billion. The decline can be explained by the reduced tax expenditures for the PTC and ITC as these provisions phase down or expire. Treasury estimates that tax expenditures supporting fossil fuels will total $2.2 billion in 2018. The Treasury anticipates this number increasing over time, reaching an estimated $3.8 billion by 2028. The Treasury estimates that the revenue losses associated with most permanent oil-and-gas tax incentives will increase over the next decade. The energy sector is supported by an array of tax incentives reflecting diverse policy objectives. As a result, the amount of tax-related federal financial support for energy differs across energy sectors, and is not necessarily proportional to the amount of energy production from various energy sectors. The total amount of energy-related tax incentives is projected to decline under current law, although extensions of expired energy tax provisions, or other modifications to energy tax provisions, could change these figures. Over the longer term, the amount of tax-related support for the energy sector could decline if provisions are allowed to expire as scheduled under current law. ", "answers": ["The U.S. tax code supports the energy sector by providing a number of targeted tax incentives, or tax incentives available only for the energy industry. Some policymakers have expressed interest in understanding how energy tax benefits are distributed across different domestic energy resources. For example, what percentage of energy-related tax benefits support fossil fuels (or support renewables)? How much domestic energy is produced using fossil fuels (or produced using renewables)? And how do these figures compare? In 2017, the value of federal tax-related support for the energy sector was estimated to be $17.8 billion. Of this, $4.6 billion (25.8%) can be attributed to tax incentives supporting fossil fuels. Tax-related support for renewables was an estimated $11.6 billion in 2017 (or 65.2% of total tax-related support for energy). The remaining tax-related support went toward nuclear energy, efficiency measures, and alternative technology vehicles. While the cost of tax incentives for renewables has exceeded the cost of incentives for fossil fuels in recent years, the majority of energy produced in the United States continues to be derived from fossil fuels. In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 77.7% of U.S. primary energy production. The remaining primary energy production is attributable to renewable energy and nuclear electric resources, with shares of 12.8% and 9.5%, respectively. The balance of energy-related tax incentives has changed over time, and it is projected to continue to change, under current law, in coming years. Factors that have contributed to recent changes in the balance of energy-related tax incentives include the following: Increased tax expenditures for solar and wind. Tax expenditures associated with the energy credit for solar and the production tax credit for wind have increased substantially in recent years. Following the long-term extensions of these temporary tax benefits provided in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113), tax expenditures for the solar energy credit are projected to remain stable for several years, before decreasing in the longer term. The expiration of tax-related support for renewable fuels. Tax-related support for renewable fuels declined substantially after the tax credits for alcohol fuels were allowed to expire at the end of 2011. Other fuels-related incentives also expired at the end of 2017 (although these may be extended as part of the \"tax extenders\"). Decline then increase in tax expenditures for fossil fuels. Tax expenditures for fossil fuels declined between 2017 and 2018, an indirect effect of the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Over time, however, the tax expenditures associated with permanent fossil fuels tax incentives are estimated to increase. One starting point for evaluating energy tax policy may be a calculation of subsidy relative to production level. However, a complete policy analysis might consider why the level of federal financial support differs across various energy technologies. Tax incentives for energy may support various environmental or economic objectives. For example, tax incentives designed to reduce reliance on imported petroleum may be consistent with energy security goals. Tax incentives that promote renewable energy resources may be consistent with certain environmental objectives."], "length": 3582, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "696ffc1495c6e4840e7932648c36f847483e7cf79136fa91"}
{"input": "", "context": "The DEA, within the Department of Justice, is responsible for ensuring the availability of controlled substances for legitimate uses while preventing their diversion through its administration and enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations. Under the Controlled Substances Act, all persons or entities that manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances are required to register with DEA, unless specifically exempted. DEA regulates these entities to limit diversion and prevent abuse. For example, DEA regulates pharmaceutical companies that manufacture controlled substances, health care providers who prescribe them to patients, and pharmacies that dispense them. In October 2010, the Disposal Act amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow the public to deliver unused controlled substances to an entity authorized by DEA to dispose of the substances. DEA was given responsibility for promulgating the implementing regulations, and the Disposal Act stipulated that the regulations should prevent diversion of controlled substances while also taking into consideration public health and safety, ease and cost of implementation, and participation by various communities. In addition to disposal bins, DEA’s regulations describe two other options for the public to transfer controlled substances for the purpose of disposal: mail-back programs and take-back events. Law enforcement agencies may use all three methods of drug disposal without the need for authorization by DEA. The Disposal Act stipulates that the regulations cannot require an entity to participate in or establish any of the disposal options. To participate as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, eligible entities—retail pharmacies, hospitals/clinics with an on-site pharmacy, narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, distributors, and drug manufacturers that are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—must modify their DEA registration. According to DEA officials, such modification is free and simple to do. Eligible retail pharmacies or hospitals/clinics that become authorized collectors are able to install and maintain disposal bins in long-term care facilities in addition to their own location. DEA’s website contains a public search feature to identify authorized collectors located near a specific zip code or address. Authorized collectors must install, manage, and maintain the disposal bins following DEA regulations. For example, under DEA’s regulations for maintaining the disposal bins, the disposal bin must be securely fastened to a permanent structure, securely locked, substantially constructed with a permanent outer container and removable inner liner, and have a small opening that allows contents to be added but not removed; the bin must also prominently display a sign indicating which types of substances are acceptable; users must dispose the unused prescriptions into the collection receptacle themselves without handing them to staff at the pharmacy; the disposal bin must typically be located in an area where an employee is present and near where controlled substances are stored, and the bin must be made inaccessible to the public when an employee is not present; the inner liner of the disposal bin must meet certain requirements, including being waterproof, tamper-evident, tear-resistant, opaque, and having the size and identification number clearly labeled; and the installation and removal of inner liners must be performed under the supervision of at least two employees of the authorized collector. DEA regulations also require that all controlled substances collected in the disposal bin’s inner liners must be destroyed in compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and rendered non-retrievable. According to DEA regulations, non-retrievable means that the physical and chemical conditions of the controlled substance must be permanently altered, thereby rendering the controlled substance unavailable and unusable for all practical purposes. Authorized collectors are permitted to destroy the inner liner on their premises if they have the capacity to do so. If not, the inner liners can be transported to a separate location to be destroyed. Typically, in this case, an authorized collector contracts with a reverse distributor to periodically remove, transport, and destroy the inner liners. DEA regulations require that two reverse distributor employees transport the inner liners directly to the disposal location without any unnecessary stops or stops of an extended duration. Authorized collectors must document certain information, including inner liner identification numbers and the dates that each liner is installed, removed, and transferred for destruction. The authorized collectors must maintain these records for 2 years. Figure 1 summarizes the steps involved in the collection of unused prescription drugs. About 3 percent of pharmacies and other eligible entities have voluntarily chosen to become DEA-authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs, according to DEA data. As of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) of eligible entities—which are already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most of the authorized collectors— about 81 percent—were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. (See table 1). Narcotic treatment programs, reverse distributors, and distributors made up approximately 1 percent of the authorized collectors. We also found that participation rates varied by state, though in most states relatively few of the eligible entities had registered with DEA to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. In 44 states, less than 5 percent of the eligible entities had registered. (See figure 2 and appendix I for more information on the participation rates of authorized collectors in each state). As of April 2017, Connecticut, Missouri, and Maine had the lowest participation rates, with 0.11, 0.22, and 0.70 percent, respectively. In contrast, North Dakota had the highest participation rate, with 32.0 percent of its pharmacies and other eligible entities registered to be authorized collectors. The state with next highest participation rate was Alaska, with 8.96 percent. In North Dakota, the state’s Board of Pharmacy provides funding for authorized collectors to purchase and maintain the disposal bins. According to a board official, the board decided to fund these activities to increase participation rates and plans to continue its funding indefinitely using revenue generated from prescription drug licensing fees it collects. In addition, our analysis shows that about 82 percent of all authorized collectors were located in urban areas as of April 2017. However, when comparing the entities registered to be authorized collectors with the total number of eligible entities, we found that a larger percentage of the eligible entities in rural areas became authorized collectors compared with those in urban areas (see table 2). The data we obtained on the number of eligible and participating authorized collectors and their locations are the only available DEA data on the use of disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. According to DEA officials, the agency does not collect any other information on the use of disposal bins, such as the extent to which the bins are used, or the amount and types of prescription drugs deposited into the bins. For example, to minimize the risk of diversion, DEA regulations do not allow authorized collectors to open and inspect the inner liners of the disposal bins, so information on their contents cannot be collected. According to DEA officials, the agency is not responsible for collecting information on the amount and types of prescription drugs destroyed through the disposal bins. DEA officials told us that the agency views its responsibility solely as giving pharmacies and other eligible entities the opportunity to become authorized collectors. Though we do not have information on the extent to which individuals use DEA’s prescription drug disposal bins, we were able to estimate that as of April 2017, about half of the country’s population lived less than 5 miles away from a pharmacy or other DEA-authorized entity offering a prescription disposal bin. In 21 states, at least 50 percent of the state’s population lived within 5 miles of a prescription disposal bin. (See figure 3). While close to half of the nation’s population lived less than 5 miles from a disposal bin as of April 2017, the availability of nearby disposal bins varied significantly for people depending on whether they lived in an urban or a rural area. Specifically, about 52 percent of the population in urban areas lived less than 5 miles away from a disposal bin, compared to about 13 percent of the population in rural areas. Furthermore, about 44 percent of the population in rural areas lived even further away—more than 30 miles away from a disposal bin. An exception to this is North Dakota, where about 86 percent of its urban population and about 64 percent of its rural population lived within 5 miles of a disposal bin. According to officials from the 11 stakeholder organizations we interviewed—which represent authorized collectors and long-term care facilities—several factors may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have chosen to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs. These factors include the associated costs of participating, uncertainty over proper implementation, and participation in other, similar efforts for disposing of unused prescription drugs. Costs: Stakeholders said that the costs associated with purchasing, installing, and managing the disposal bins is a factor that explains the relatively low rate of participation. One stakeholder told us that many eligible entities may decide that the benefit of participating does not outweigh the costs associated with doing so. Specifically, stakeholders told us that the major costs associated with participating include the one-time cost of purchasing and installing a disposal bin; the ongoing costs to train personnel to manage the bins; and the cost of contracting with a reverse distributor to periodically dispose of the bin’s inner liner and contents. Stakeholders gave varying examples of the specific costs associated with these investments. For example, one stakeholder estimated the yearly costs of maintaining a disposal bin ranged from $500 to $600 per location; another stakeholder said that the cost is thousands of dollars per location per year, but did not provide a specific estimate. These stakeholders added that costs can increase if the disposal bins fill more quickly and need to be emptied more often than expected. For their part, officials from the reverse distributor stakeholders we interviewed cited incinerating hazardous waste, the availability of incinerators, and the cost of personnel as factors that increase the cost of their services for authorized collectors. One reverse distributor stakeholder told us that there are not many incinerators available, requiring them to travel long distances to incinerate collected waste. The other reverse distributor stakeholder added that DEA’s requirement that a second employee be present during the transportation and disposal increases the cost of their services. While some stakeholders speculated that costs are a reason for low participation, a few stakeholders told us that the benefits are worth the costs. In fact, two stakeholders we spoke with told us that the benefit to the communities was so important that they decided to provide funding to retail pharmacies, alleviating an individual pharmacy’s concern about the cost of installing and maintaining the disposal bins. We found that as of April 2017, over a quarter of the 2,233 authorized collectors using disposal bins received external funding to pay for the costs associated with installing and maintaining the disposal bins. In addition, stakeholders told us that some localities have enacted laws known as extended producer responsibility ordinances, which require that pharmaceutical manufacturers pay for certain costs associated with drug disposal. When asked about the costs associated with operating disposal bins, DEA officials told us that addressing cost issues with eligible participants falls outside of their responsibilities. Uncertainty: Stakeholders also told us that uncertainty regarding how to comply with aspects of DEA’s regulations for prescription drug disposal bins affected their decisions to participate. One stakeholder added that many eligible entities decide not to participate because uncertainties over participation requirements could result in inadvertent non-compliance with DEA’s regulations. As an example of their uncertainty over some of the requirements governing the disposal bins, officials from both of the reverse distributor stakeholders we interviewed cited DEA’s non-retrievable standard for destruction of the inner liners of the bins. DEA requires that the method of destruction be sufficient to render all controlled substances non- retrievable, meaning that the physical and chemical conditions of the controlled substances must be permanently altered and unusable in order to prevent diversion for illicit purposes. Both reverse distributor stakeholders told us that they are uncertain about whether certain disposal methods meet this standard, and they said that the agency has not provided further guidance on how reverse distributors can meet this requirement. DEA officials told us that the agency responds to questions about whether a specific method of destruction meets the non-retrievable standard by telling the registrant to test the remnants after destruction, to see if any components of the controlled substance are still present. In its summary of the regulations implementing the Disposal Act, DEA stated that in order to allow for the development of various methods of destruction, the agency did not require a specific method of destruction as long as the desired result is achieved. However, DEA officials stated that to their knowledge, incineration is the only method known to meet the non-retrievable standard to date, but the officials hoped other methods will be developed in the future. When asked about the guidance they provide to authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs or those eligible to become authorized collectors, DEA officials told us that they post frequently-asked questions on their website, routinely answer questions from participants and others, and give training presentations at conferences that include information on the disposal bins. In our prior work, we found problems with DEA’s communication and guidance to stakeholders. In 2015, we recommended that DEA identify and implement cost-effective means for communicating regularly with pharmacies and other entities authorized to handle controlled substances. DEA agreed with the recommendation, and officials told us that, starting in August 2017, these entities can subscribe to DEA’s website to receive notifications when it is updated with new guidance. Stakeholders also noted that some DEA requirements related to disposal bins may conflict with other state and federal requirements governing the transportation and disposal of hazardous waste, which includes some controlled substances. For example, the two reverse distributor stakeholders told us that some incinerator permits issued by states require that hazardous waste be examined before incineration; however, DEA requirements do not allow the contents of the liners to be examined, even at the time of incineration. To address the incinerator permit requirements, one reverse distributor told us that they use the Environmental Protection Agency’s hazardous waste household exemption, which treats the liners as household waste and thereby allows incinerator facilities to destroy the liners without examining the contents or violating their state permit. In addition, some stakeholders raised concerns that DEA’s regulations may conflict with other federal regulations. For instance, one stakeholder noted that they recently learned that transporting the disposal bin’s inner liners could violate Department of Transportation regulations. DEA officials told us that they were aware of this, explaining that the conflict was between DEA’s requirement that controlled substances be transported in liners and the Department of Transportation’s requirement that this type of waste be transported in sturdy containers. According to DEA officials, this conflict has been resolved by the Department of Transportation allowing reverse distributors to place the liners inside sturdy containers kept on trucks. Participation in or Availability of Similar Efforts: Stakeholders said that some pharmacies and other eligible entities were already participating in other, similar efforts that allow for the safe disposal of controlled substances, and therefore they did not want to invest additional resources into participating as authorized collectors using disposal bins. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has an established process that long-term care facilities use to dispose of their unused controlled substances. As a result, all of the long-term care stakeholders told us that long-term care facilities may choose not to partner with pharmacies interested in placing disposal bins within their facilities because it adds significant cost and effort without any additional benefit. Furthermore, pharmacy stakeholders noted that because of the availability of other prescription drug collection efforts in their communities, they did not think that maintaining a disposal bin at their locations was needed. For example, two of the stakeholders explained that local law enforcement precincts already had a similar type of disposal bin in place to collect unused prescription drugs. DEA officials told us that they were aware of other options for the public and entities such as long-term care facilities that are not registered as authorized collectors to dispose of controlled substances. The officials also indicated that the availability of disposal options at law enforcement agencies contributes to the low participation rates among pharmacies as authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs.

About half of the people who reported misusing prescription drugs in 2015 received them from a friend or relative. One way to help prevent this kind of diversion and potential misuse is by providing secure and convenient ways to dispose of unused, unneeded, or expired prescription medications. The Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 authorizes pharmacies and other entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances to also collect unused prescription drugs for disposal. In 2014, DEA finalized regulations for the implementation of the Act, establishing a voluntary process for eligible entities to become authorized collectors of unused prescription drugs using disposal bins. GAO was asked to review participation among authorized collectors that maintain disposal bins. In this report GAO describes (1) participation rates among entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs and (2) factors that affect participation. GAO analyzed the most currently available DEA data from April 2017 on entities eligible to participate and those participating as authorized collectors. GAO also conducted interviews with DEA officials and a nongeneralizable sample of 11 stakeholder organizations selected to illustrate different types of authorized collectors and long-term care facilities. GAO is not making any recommendations. DEA provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. GAO found that about 3 percent of pharmacies and other entities eligible to collect unused prescription drugs for disposal have volunteered to do so. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) authorizes these entities to dispose of unused drugs to help reduce their potential misuse. Analysis of DEA data shows that as of April 2017, 2,233 of the 89,550 (2.49 percent) eligible entities—that is, certain entities already authorized by DEA to handle controlled substances—had registered with DEA to use disposal bins to collect unused prescription drugs. Most—about 81 percent—of the authorized collectors were pharmacies, followed by hospitals or clinics. GAO also found that participation rates varied by state, though in 44 states less than 5 percent of the state's pharmacies and other eligible entities had registered to become authorized collectors. Stakeholders cited several factors that may explain why relatively few pharmacies and other eligible entities have registered with DEA as authorized collectors of unused drugs. Most notably, stakeholders representing authorized collectors told GAO that because participation is voluntary, the cost associated with maintaining a disposal bin—which includes purchasing and installing the bin according to DEA requirements and paying for the destruction of its contents—is an important factor to weigh against potential benefits. DEA noted that availability of disposal by law enforcement agencies also contributes to low participation."], "length": 3373, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dc1afcec9b546bb4416701e28661f0c245d9fc5f4a60c22e"}
{"input": "", "context": "Part of the Mariana Islands Archipelago, the CNMI is a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific Ocean, just north of Guam and about 3,200 miles west of Hawaii. The CNMI has a total population of 53,890, according to the CNMI’s 2016 Household, Income, and Expenditures Survey. Almost 90 percent of the population (48,200) resided on the island of Saipan, with an additional 6 percent (3,056) on the island of Tinian and 5 percent (2,635) on the island of Rota. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 amended the U.S.– CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. To provide for an orderly transition from the CNMI immigration system to the U.S. federal immigration system under the immigration laws of the United States, DHS established the CW program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers are able to obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI for up to a year. The Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 requires DHS to annually reduce the number of CW-1 permits until the number reaches zero by the end of the transition period. The act was amended in December 2014 to extend the transition period through December 31, 2019. The act was further amended in August 2017 to, among other things, (1) add 350 CW-1 permits to the fiscal year 2017 cap; (2) restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations; and (3) increase the CNMI education funding fee that employers must pay for each permit from $150 to $200. DHS determines the annual cap on CW-1 permits and the terms and conditions of the CW program. In November 2017, DHS set the cap for CW-1 permits for fiscal year 2018 through the end of the program (see table 1). The proposed bill, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act (S. 2325), includes the following provisions, among others, that would affect the CW program: (1) the number of permits to be allocated each year, (2) the distribution of the permits, and (3) a new CW-3 worker designation. Under the terms of S. 2325, the number of permits issued may not exceed 13,000 during fiscal year 2019. Starting in fiscal year 2020, the number of permits issued may not exceed a number that is 500 fewer than the number issued during the immediately preceding fiscal year. Figure 1 shows the past and future numerical limits on CNMI-Only Transitional Worker permits established by DHS and the proposed numerical limits for permits under S. 2325. The limits shown for S. 2325 in figure 1 assume that employers would petition for, and DHS would issue, the maximum number of available permits for fiscal year 2019 and for each subsequent year. Under S. 2325, as under the current law, a permit for construction and extraction occupations would be issued only to extend a permit that was first issued before October 1, 2015. Also, S. 2325 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider, in good faith, any comments or advice submitted by the CNMI governor, including any recommendation to reserve a number of permits each year for occupational categories necessary to maintain public health or safety in the commonwealth. S. 2325 proposes a new CW-3 worker designation. Foreign workers who are otherwise admissible would be eligible for CW-3 permits if they were admitted to the CNMI as CW-1 workers during fiscal year 2014 and every subsequent fiscal year beginning before the date of the enactment of S. 2325. These workers would receive a permit to remain in the CNMI for a 3-year period beginning on the date of S. 2325’s enactment. CW-3 permits could be renewed in 3-year increments during the transition period for workers who remain outside the United States for a continuous period of not less than 30 days during the 180-day period immediately preceding each such renewal. CW-3 permits would count against the numerical caps specified in S. 2325. The CNMI’s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has grown each year since 2012. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that the CNMI’s GDP increased by almost 29 percent in 2016 after increasing by about 4 percent in 2015. BEA attributes this economic growth to a significant increase in visitor spending, particularly for casino gambling, and investment in the construction of a casino resort in Saipan and other hotel construction. Figure 2 shows the casino’s development site in Saipan before and during construction. The new casino opened for business on July 6, 2017. Since 1990, the CNMI’s tourism market has experienced considerable fluctuation, as evidenced by total annual visitor arrivals (see fig. 3). Visitor arrivals to the CNMI declined from a peak of 726,690 in fiscal year 1997 to a low of 338,106 in fiscal year 2011, or by 53 percent. However, since 2011, visitor arrivals have nearly doubled, reaching 653,150 in fiscal year 2017, and increased by 30 percent from 2016 to 2017. Data from the Marianas Visitors Authority show that the downward trend in Japanese arrivals from 2013 to 2017 was offset by the growth in arrivals from China and South Korea. While eligible Japanese and South Korean visitors enter the CNMI under the U.S. visa waiver program, Chinese visitors are not eligible for the program and are allowed to be temporarily present in the CNMI under DHS’s discretionary parole authority, according to DHS officials. DHS exercises parole authority to allow, on a case-by-case basis, eligible nationals of China to enter the CNMI temporarily as tourists when there is significant public benefit, according to DHS. Following consecutive annual decreases in the total number of employed workers from 2005 through 2013, employment has increased annually since 2014, according to CNMI tax data. Figure 4 shows the numbers of employed workers, both foreign and domestic, in the CNMI from 2001 through 2016. From 2013 to 2016, the number of employed workers increased by approximately 25 percent, from 23,344 to 29,215. As figure 4 shows, while the number and percentage of foreign workers fell between 2001 and 2016, foreign workers still constitute the majority of the CNMI workforce. Of the nearly 30,000 employed workers in the CNMI in 2016, more than half were foreign workers, according to CNMI tax data. The number of foreign workers fell from a peak of over 38,000 in 2002—roughly 75 percent of employed workers—to fewer than 16,000 in 2016. In contrast, since 2002, the number of domestic workers has fluctuated from year to year, ranging from about 10,500 to almost 13,700, but increased by 28 percent from 2013 to 2016. The CNMI economy continues to experience growing demand for workers. In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the number of CW-1 permits almost doubled, and since fiscal year 2016, the number of permits has approached the numerical limits on permits for those years. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CW-1 permits grew from 7,127 in fiscal year 2012 to more than 13,000 in fiscal year 2016. On October 14, 2016—2 weeks into fiscal year 2017—USCIS announced that it had received enough petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2017 and would not accept requests for new permits for that year during the remaining 11 months. In May 2017, USCIS announced that it had received a sufficient number of petitions to reach the CW-1 cap for fiscal year 2018. Table 2 shows the CW-1 permit caps and numbers of permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018. According to USCIS officials, as of January 26, 2018, fiscal year 2018 petitions were still being adjudicated. Our preliminary analysis of USCIS CW-1 permit data for fiscal years 2012 through 2018 identified trends in CW-1 workers’ country of birth, occupation, and duration of employment. USCIS data showed a decline in the numbers of CW-1 permits for fiscal years 2017 through 2018 for workers born in each of the five countries listed most frequently on the petitions—the Philippines, China, South Korea, Bangladesh, and Japan (see table 3). As of January 17, 2018, the number of permits approved for workers born in the Philippines, who received the most permits for all 7 years of the CW program, had declined by 13 percent from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018 and by 26 percent from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2018. Concurrent with construction of the casino and other tourism infrastructure, the number of CW-1 permits for workers born in China increased by almost 3,800 from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 and declined by about 3,500 from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. Our preliminary analysis indicates that as of January 17, 2018, USCIS had approved 750 CW-1 permits for construction workers for fiscal year 2018. This number represents a 75 percent decline from the nearly 3,000 permits approved for fiscal year 2017 (see table 4). This decline reflects new restrictions on future permits for workers in construction occupations. Of the 8,228 foreign workers who had been granted fiscal year 2018 permits as of January 17, 2018, 2,352 had maintained continuous employment in the CNMI since fiscal year 2014 (see table 5). Of the 2,352 workers with continuous employment in fiscal years 2014 through 2018, 1,905 workers (81 percent) were born in the Philippines.

L. No. 110-229, enacted in 2008, amended the U.S.-CNMI covenant to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI after a transition period. The law required the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a temporary work permit program for foreign workers. DHS is required to decrease the number of permits issued annually, reducing them to zero by the end of the transition period, scheduled for December 31, 2019. To implement the law, DHS established a new work permit program in 2011. Under the program, foreign workers can obtain, through their employers, nonimmigrant CW-1 status that allows them to work in the CNMI. The law was amended in August 2017 to, among other things, restrict future permits for workers in construction and extraction occupations. Proposed legislation—Senate bill S. 2325—would, among other things, extend the transition period through December 31, 2029; increase the number of available permits from the 2018 level; and set required decreases in the annual numerical limit for the permits. (See figure for past numerical limits established by DHS and future limits proposed by S. 2325.) This testimony discusses (1) recent trends in the CNMI economy and (2) preliminary observations about the number of approved CW-1 permits and characteristics of permit holders, drawn from GAO's ongoing work. GAO updated information about the CNMI's economy that it reported in May 2017 (see GAO-17-437 ). GAO also analyzed data and documents from U.S. agencies and the CNMI government. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands' (CNMI) inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) has grown each year since 2012, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2016, the CNMI's GDP rose by 29 percent, partly as a result of construction investment. While tourism has fluctuated in recent years, visitor arrivals in the CNMI rose by nearly a third from 2016 to 2017. After nearly a decade of annual decline, the total number of workers employed in the CNMI increased from 2013 through 2016, according to the most recent available CNMI tax data. Foreign workers made up 53 percent of those employed in 2016, compared with roughly 75 percent in 2002. GAO's preliminary analysis indicates that the number of approved CNMI-Only Transitional Worker (CW-1) permits for foreign workers in the CNMI grew from over 7,100 for fiscal year 2012 to nearly 13,000 for fiscal year 2017. In addition, GAO identified trends in the country of birth, occupation, and employment duration of foreign workers with CW-1 permits approved for fiscal years 2012 through 2018. Workers born in the Philippines received the highest number of CW-1 permits each year. As of January 2018, 750 CW-1 permits had been granted to construction workers for fiscal year 2018—a 75 percent decline from the prior fiscal year. GAO estimated that approximately 2,350 foreign workers with approved CW-1 permits maintained continuous employment in the CNMI from fiscal year 2014 through January 2018. About 80 percent of these workers were born in the Philippines."], "length": 2202, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "d1d5498b810d6a3e59553c6813a13a3f4371bd3a9fda0a91"}
{"input": "", "context": "The FAR establishes several types of source selection procedures, which include the tradeoff procedure on one end of the best value continuum and LPTA procedures on the other end. (see fig. 1). DOD may elect to use the LPTA procedure where the requirement is clearly defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal. In such cases, DOD has determined that cost or price should play a dominant role in the source selection. When using LPTA procedures, DOD specifies its minimum requirements in the solicitation. Firms submit their proposals and DOD determines which of the proposals meet or exceed those requirements, no tradeoffs between cost or price and non-cost factors (for example, technical capabilities or past performance) are permitted, and the award is made based on the lowest price technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government. Non- cost factors are rated on an acceptable or unacceptable basis. By contrast, DOD may elect to use tradeoff procedures in acquisitions where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these instances, non-cost factors may play a dominant role in the source selection process. Tradeoffs between price and non-cost factors allow DOD to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires DOD to state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than, approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price. DOD’s March 2016 Source Selection guide offers additional guidance regarding the use of LPTA source selection procedures. The guidance is mandatory for acquisitions conducted as part of a major system acquisition program and all competitive FAR part 15 procurements with an estimated value over $10 million. The guidance states that LPTA procedures may be used in situations where there would not be any value on a product or service exceeding the required technical or performance requirements. The guidance also states that such situations may include acquisitions for well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services and where risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, and when it has been determined there would be no need or value to pay more for higher performance. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 NDAA required that DOD revise the DFARS to require that LPTA procedures only be used in situations when the following six criteria are met. 1. DOD can clearly describe the minimum requirements in terms of performance objectives, measures, and standards that will be used to determine acceptability of offers; 2. DOD would realize no, or little, value from a proposal exceeding the solicitation’s minimum technical requirements; 3. The proposed technical approaches can be evaluated with little or no subjectivity as to the desirability of one versus the other; 4. There is a high degree of certainty that a review of technical proposals other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors that could provide other benefits to the government; 5. The contracting officer has included a justification for the use of LPTA procedures in the contract file; and 6. The lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs, including for operations and support. Section 813 also established that implementing revisions to the DFARS were to be completed within 120 days of enactment of the NDAA, but the revisions had not been put in place as of October 2017. DOD officials stated that the changes to the DFARS are currently in progress. In 2010 and 2014, we reported on DOD’s use of best value tradeoff source selection procedures. In 2010, we found that, for 60 of the 88 contracts reviewed, DOD used a tradeoff process and weighted non-cost factors as more important than price. In these cases, DOD was willing to pay more when a firm demonstrated it understood complex technical issues more thoroughly, could provide a needed good or service to meet deadlines, or had a proven track record in successfully delivering products or services of a similar nature. In addition, we determined that when making tradeoff decisions, DOD selected a lower priced proposal nearly as often as it selected a higher technically rated, but more costly, proposal. In so doing, DOD chose not to pay more than $800 million in proposed costs by selecting a lower priced offer over a higher technically rated offer in 18 contracts. The majority of solicitations where non-cost factors were equal to or less important than cost were for less complex requirements. DOD faced several challenges when using best value tradeoff procedures, including: the difficulties in developing meaningful evaluation factors, the additional time investment needed to conduct best value procurements, and the greater level of business judgment required of acquisition staff when compared to other acquisition approaches. To help DOD effectively employ the best value tradeoff process, we recommended that DOD develop training elements such as case studies that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions. DOD concurred and implemented the recommendation in August 2012. In 2014, we found that DOD had increased its use of LPTA procedures for new contracts with obligations over $25 million—using LPTA source selection procedures to award an estimated 36 percent of new fiscal year 2013 contracts compared to 26 percent in fiscal year 2009—and that officials’ decisions on which source selection method would be used was generally rooted in knowledge about the requirements and contractors. For contracts with obligations over $25 million, DOD used LPTA source selection procedures primarily to acquire commercial products such as fuel, and we identified relatively few uses of LPTA to acquire higher dollar services. For contracts with obligations over $1 million and under $25 million, DOD used LPTA procedures an estimated 45 percent of the time for a mix of products and services, including fuel, aircraft parts, computer equipment, construction-related services, engineering support services, and ship maintenance and repairs. We did not make recommendations to DOD in this report. The Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used LPTA source selection procedures for IT and support services contracts valued at $10 million or more that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017. Our analysis found that the three military departments awarded 781 new contracts valued at $10 million or more during this time frame. Of these 781 contracts, 133 contracts were awarded for IT and support services. However, only 9 of the 133 contracts used LPTA source selection procedures (see fig. 2). Table 1 provides information on the 7 contracts we reviewed that were awarded in the first half of fiscal year 2017 that used LPTA source selection procedures. As previously noted, we excluded 2 of the 9 contracts from further review due to bid protests. Contracting officials cited a number of factors that were considered when determining to use LPTA procedures in the 7 selected contracts we reviewed. For all of the contracts, officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. For these contracts, contracting officials also stated that LPTA procedures were used, in part, because the requirements were well- defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. Additional details on the contracts follow. The Army awarded an IDIQ contract, with a one-year base period and four 1-year options, for support services in Afghanistan with an estimated ceiling value of $85,000,000. This is a reoccurring requirement to hire Afghan nationals to provide on-site construction management, engineering, and technical support services for reconstruction projects throughout Afghanistan. The acquisition plan states that Afghan nationals can more freely move about the country compared to U.S. personnel. Further, a contracting official stated that it was determined that no additional value would be gained by paying a premium for these services and that the lowest price was the best choice. In addition, to mitigate risk of poor performance, one requirement of the contract is to maintain a qualified workforce. Officials stated that approximately 90 percent of personnel performing on the previous contract are working on the current contract. The Air Force awarded three contracts for base operation support services—vehicle maintenance, airfield maintenance, fuel management, and traffic management—at an Air Force Reserve Base and two Air Reserve Stations. All of the contracts were awarded with a one-month orientation period, one-year base period, four 1-year options, and a final 6-month option, with total estimated values ranging from $24.7 million to $38.2 million. Acquisition plans for these requirements stated that the services were well defined. Additionally, contracting officials stated that there is at least a decade of past experience with these requirements, and, as a result, the requirements are well known. The Air Force awarded a contract for centralized mail sorting services in Germany. The contract consists of a 2-month phase-in period, a 2- month base period, four 1-year options, and one 8-month option, with a total estimated value of approximately $21.5 million. The acquisition plan for this requirement stated that a LPTA source selection procedure was chosen because the requirement was well-defined and not technically complex. For example, the acquisition plan noted that there was more than a decade of historical data that helped define and estimate the volume of mail that would need to be sorted. Contracting officials reiterated that LPTA was used since the service was well-defined, the risk of poor performance was low, and that it was determined that additional trade-offs would not provide an additional benefit to the taxpayer. The Army awarded an IDIQ contract to look for vulnerabilities in software code. The contract, which was set aside for small businesses, had a 5-year ordering period and an estimated ceiling value of $17.1 million. The contractor was required to perform a software review using several government approved code analysis tools and then characterize any potential vulnerabilities identified by the tools in terms of risk levels prescribed by established government cybersecurity standards. Army requirements officials stated that they determined there was no additional value to be gained from additional innovations in doing either task. Our review found some indication that the requirement, however, might not have been clearly understood by offerors. For example, the Army received 12 offers which ranged from $800,177 to $46,680,003. The contracting officer attributed the range of offers to the inexperience of some offerors with preparing proposals or misunderstanding this type of requirement, and the two lowest offers were determined to be technically unacceptable. The Navy awarded a contract to perform commercially available monthly telephone maintenance, which includes preventive and remedial maintenance on a specific brand of phone systems that Navy locations in California use. The contract consists of a one-year base period and two 1-year options, with an estimated total value of approximately $15.9 million. The acquisition plan stated that only certified authorized dealers could perform maintenance on these phones. A contracting official stated the requirement was well-defined and required the highest tier of maintenance options that could be offered, and, as a result, there was no tradeoff available. The highest tier requires that maintenance be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in multiple Navy locations, and that the contractor must respond to emergencies within 15 minutes during normal business hours. The contract also includes maintenance for all switches, inside wiring and any necessary relocation services, among other support requirements. 1. One contracting official determined that minimum performance requirements for the $15.9 million contract for monthly telephone maintenance services could be described using objective performance measures, and the contract documents showed the technical acceptability of offers was tied to the description of these requirements in the statement of work. In another example, documents related to the award of a $27.9 million Air Force contract for base operations services show performance objectives and standards set forth as evaluation factors. procedures may be used only when DOD would realize little or no value from a proposal that exceeds the solicitation’s minimum technical requirements. Our interviews with contracting officials and review of contract documents found that in each case, DOD officials assessed whether the department could receive value from a contract awarded on a tradeoff basis where the proposal exceeded the minimum technical requirements, and determined that there would be no additional value to be gained. 3. Most officials said they felt that it was possible to evaluate the proposals they received with little subjectivity, although they had not always explicitly made and documented this assessment. Officials for two contracts stated, for example, that the threshold question of technical acceptability for their contracts was whether the offering firms possessed certain licenses or accreditation to perform services on specific equipment or in specific locations. No subjectivity was involved in this assessment; therefore, they viewed the question of technical acceptability as essentially objective. However, because they were not required to document this assessment, contract documents did not provide evidence of an assessment of subjectivity. 4. Officials for most of the contracts we reviewed stated they had determined that a review of technical proposals other than that of the lowest-price offeror would not identity factors that could provide other benefits. In one case officials ultimately reviewed additional proposals, which is allowed under current DOD source selection guidance. DOD’s March 2016 source selection guidance does not require contracting officers to consider the fifth and sixth criteria listed in Section 813. Accordingly, we found that contracting officers did not always document justifications for choosing LPTA procedures and did not determine that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs. Specifically, we found that: 5. Although the files for all 7 contracts contained some record of the choice of LPTA source selection procedures, files for 3 of the 7 contracts simply stated that LPTA procedures would be used and did not include an explanation or justification for the choice. Only the documents for the four Air Force contracts included some explanation of the reasons for choosing LPTA source selection procedures. While not required by DOD source selection guidance when our selected contracts were approaching source selection, providing a justification for using LPTA is one of the criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to include among the revisions to the DFARS. 6. None of the officials for our selected contracts had confirmed that the lowest price offered reflected full life-cycle costs, which is one of the criteria that Section 813 requires DOD to include among the revisions to the DFARS. For the mail delivery, telephone maintenance, and base operations support contracts we reviewed, two contracting officials noted that full life-cycle costs were not applicable and a third stated that life-cycle costs cannot be determined for a service contract. As previously noted, all of the contracts in our review were for services, not for products. A Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy official acknowledged that the application of the criterion could cause confusion and that DOD officials are considering this issue as part of efforts to revise the DFARS. As previously noted, DOD is currently developing the revisions to the DFARS that are contemplated by Section 813. DOD officials could not provide a specific timeframe for when the DFARS would be revised, noting that the revisions would need to be reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget, and then released for public comment before the revisions could be finalized. We are not making any recommendations in this report. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. DOD had no comments on the draft report.

When awarding a contract competitively, DOD may use the LPTA source selection process to select the lowest-priced offer that is technically acceptable. In contrast, DOD may use the trade-off source selection process to award a higher-priced contract to a firm if the firm's offer provides greater benefit and it is worth paying the additional cost. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 calls on DOD to avoid using the LPTA process for information technology, cybersecurity, and other knowledge-based professional support services. The Act also included a provision for GAO to report on DOD's use of LPTA procedures for contracts valued at more than $10 million. This report assesses the (1) extent to which DOD used LPTA procedures for certain services, and (2) factors that contracting officials considered when deciding to use LPTA procedures. GAO reviewed data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation to identify 781 contracts valued at $10 million or above awarded by the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the first half of fiscal year 2017, the most recent period for which data were available. GAO then selected 133 of these contracts for information technology and support services, which include services reflected in the Act. GAO identified that 9 contracts used LPTA procedures and reviewed 7 of these, including interviewing officials and reviewing contract documents. DOD had no comments on the draft report. During the first half of fiscal year 2017, the Army, Navy, and Air Force rarely used lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures when awarding contracts valued at $10 million or more for the types of services identified by the National Defense Authorization Act, such as information technology services. Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that LPTA procedures are typically for requirements that are well-defined, commercial, or non-complex products or services with a minimal risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The figure shows the military departments' limited use of LPTA procedures for contracts for selected services. For the 7 contracts that GAO reviewed, contracting officials determined that the government would not receive a benefit for paying more than the lowest price. Contracting officials also stated that LPTA was used, in part, because the requirements were well-defined, non-complex, or reoccurring. For example, the Navy used LPTA procedures to award a contract for commercially available monthly telephone maintenance services. In addition, the Air Force used LPTA procedures to award a contract for mail sorting and delivery. Section 813 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to amend its regulations to require contracting officers to consider specific criteria when deciding to use LPTA procedures. DOD has not yet revised its regulations to implement Section 813. Nevertheless, for the 7 contracts GAO reviewed, contracting officials' considerations when choosing to use LPTA procedures were often consistent with most of these new criteria. DOD officials are currently developing the revisions to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement that are contemplated by Section 813."], "length": 3187, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ba31b3f52529bcbe88526d39a80a7160c949efc3e3419dab"}
{"input": "", "context": "World Bank President Jim Yong Kim recently announced that he was stepping down in February 2019 to join Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity fund that invests in projects in advanced and developing countries. Kim's unexpected resignation, combined with his joining of a private firm that could directly compete with the World Bank for investments, raises questions for policymakers as they nominate and select a new president for the World Bank, a central component of the U.S.-led international economic order for the past eight decades. According to an informal agreement among their member countries, the U.S. nominee is chosen as the World Bank president and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This custom has been subject to increasing criticism during the past two decades. The first line of criticism is directed at the current distribution of voting power, which critics contend does not account for the increasing integration of developing countries into the global economy. A second line of criticism is directed at the method of selecting World Bank and IMF leadership, which critics argue, elevates nationality above merit and undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions. This report provides information on the 2019 World Bank selection process and discusses efforts to reform the selection process. The World Bank is a multilateral development bank (MDB) that offers loans and grants to low- and middle-income countries to promote poverty alleviation and economic development. The World Bank has near-universal membership, with 189 member nations. U.S. membership in the World Bank is authorized by a federal statute known as the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286 et seq .). Only Cuba and North Korea, and a few microstates such as the Vatican, Monaco, and Andorra, are nonmembers. Two of the Bank's five facilities, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA), lend directly to governments to finance development projects and policy programs in member countries. The IBRD provides middle-income developing countries with loans at near-market rates using funds raised by the World Bank on international capital markets. IDA was established in 1960 due to concerns that low-income countries could not afford to borrow at the near-market rate terms offered by the IBRD. IDA provides grants and concessional loans funded by contributions from donors and transfers from the IBRD to low-income countries. A country's eligibility for IBRD or IDA financial assistance depends on its relative poverty, defined as gross national income (GNI). For 2019, countries with a per capita GNI below $1,145 are eligible for IDA funding. IBRD commitments totaled $23.6 billion in 2018. Commitments from IDA to low-income countries were $24 billion in 2018 ( Table 1 ). Three other World Bank-affiliated organizations are dedicated to promoting private sector finance and investment in low-income countries. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) promotes private sector development in developing countries by making loans and investments in small- and medium-sized companies in those countries. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) provides private investors with insurance coverage against noncommercial risk (expropriation, war and civil disturbance, and/or breach of contract) in developing countries. The International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) provides dispute resolution for investment disputes between governments and foreign investors. The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank, having the largest share of the IBRD's subscribed capital, $46.4 billion (16.88%) of a total of $275 billion. As the largest contributor, the United States holds a single seat on the 25-member Board of Executive Directors and carries 16.32% of the total votes in Bank decisionmaking, which provides veto power on decisions requiring an 85% majority vote. The largest shareholders after the United States are Japan (6.89% of voting power), China (4.45%), Germany (4.03%), France (3.78%), and the United Kingdom (3.78%). The large voting power of the United States ensures the U.S. ability to veto major policy decisions at the Bank. A citizen of the United States has always held the presidency of the World Bank. The World Bank's president is chairman of the Board and elected by the Board of Directors. The president is the chief of the operating staff of the Bank and conducts, under direction of the executive directors, the ordinary business of the Bank. The Bank's 12 th president, Jim Yong Kim, has served since 2012. On September 27, 2016, Dr. Kim was reelected as the World Bank president, for a second five-year term beginning July 1, 2017. The Trump Administration has continued to support U.S. participation in the international financial institutions (IFIs) and has funded recent U.S. MDB commitments. The Trump Administration is supporting a $60.1 billion capital increase for the World Bank's main lending facility, the IBRD, which would raise its capital from $268.9 billion to $329 billion. World Bank members also endorsed a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC, which would more than triple the IFC's capital base from $2.57 billion to $8.2 billion. The Trump Administration supports the capital increase, which is to be accompanied by reforms designed, in part, to address a long-standing concern for many U.S. policymakers: high levels of World Bank lending to upper-middle income countries, especially China. In a statement at the 2017 IMF and World Bank spring meetings, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that, \"the relationship between the World Bank and more creditworthy countries [such as China] should mature over time, with the absolute level of borrowing declining as countries become better able to finance their own development objectives.\" Selecting the leadership at the two major international financial institutions—the IMF and the World Bank—is guided by a tradition that the World Bank president is an American and that the IMF managing director is a European. The informal agreement reflects the political and economic balance of power at the end of World War II. At the time, the United States believed that the World Bank should be headed by an American since the United States was the only capital surplus nation, and World Bank lending would be dependent on American financial markets. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Fred Vinson, believed that if an American representative headed the World Bank, the IMF must be headed by a non-American. Moreover, he noted, \"it would be impracticable to appoint U.S. citizens to head both the Bank and the Fund.\" Despite the growth of world capital markets, and the fact that the World Bank is no longer reliant on U.S. capital markets, the convention on the IMF and World Bank selection has remained intact. The U.S.-EU agreement is not unique. A 2009 study finds that Informal agreements allocating positions of authority and decision making pervade international organizations. Whether in secretariats or political, judicial, and administrative bodies, tacit understandings that assign representation to certain states or groups of states are the norm, not the exception... The Articles of Agreement of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) each specify that only citizens of regional countries may serve as presidents of those banks. By tradition, the Japanese Finance Ministry nominates a Japanese citizen to be president of the AsDB. The Articles of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) specify only that their president must come from a member country. By tradition, the IDB president is selected by a competitive process from among citizens of the Latin American countries. The EBRD president is also elected by a presumably competitive process, though only French and German citizens have served to date in that capacity and there is normally only one nominee. Second-tier offices in these institutions have also traditionally been reserved for U.S. citizens. First deputy managing director at the IMF and executive vice president at the IDB are traditionally U.S. citizens. These individuals are appointed by the chief executive of the institution, but in the case of the IMF and IDB an individual is typically designated by the U.S. Government. At the Asian Development Bank and EBRD, one of the vice presidents for an operational region has typically been a U.S. citizen. However, despite these restrictions, there have been successful efforts to open up the selection process across the MDBs. In 2015, the AfDB members elected Akinwumi Adesina of Nigeria, after a transparent election involving seven other candidates. Adesina garnered 58% of the total vote of AfDB shareholders. The 2012 World Bank election was the first to include several candidates and Kim's nomination was, unlike past nominations, not unanimous. The announcement of Kim's selection noted that a new selection process (introduced in 2011) yielded multiple nominees (former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and former Colombian Finance Minister and United Nations Under Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Jose Antonio Ocampo) and that the nominees received support from different member countries. The formal guidelines for choosing the World Bank president are laid out in the Bank's Articles of Agreements and Bylaws. Article V, Section 5, states that \"[t]he Executive Board shall select a President who shall not be a Governor or an Executive Director. \" This decision may be reached by a simple majority of the Executive Board. Section 13(c) of the Bank's bylaws stipulates the terms of service. World Bank presidents are elected for renewable five-year terms. Neither the articles nor the bylaws articulate any specific qualifications for the position of president of the World Bank. The Bank's Articles of Agreement, however, are silent on any requirements on how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. There is no formal search process for candidates. Nominations can only be made by the 25 World Bank executive directors and there is no concerted search process of the Executive Board to identify and vet possible candidates. In 2000, two internal working groups (the World Bank Working Group to Review the Process for Selection of the President and the International Monetary Fund Working Group to Review the Process for Selection of the Managing Director) were created to discuss the selection procedure. A joint draft report of the working groups was endorsed by the executive directors on April 26, 2001, but never formally implemented. The report declared, among other things, that transparency and accountability are critical to the selection process. Instead of implementing the 2001 report's recommendations, the Executive Board adopted in 2011 a procedure that specified qualification criteria, established a nomination period, and provided for an interview process. Critics point out that the agreed procedures remain vague and largely nontransparent. Most notably, development expertise is not included as a qualification and the decision will be taken not by public vote, but rather by consensus according to prior practice. Declaring the importance of an \"open, transparent, and merit-based\" process, yet continuing to perpetuate the status quo, according to three former World Bank chief economists, is hypocritical, and \"destroys the trust and spirit of collaboration needed to manage the profound problems facing the world.\" The decision to select a new World Bank president is to be made by a majority vote of the World Bank's Executive Board. Unlike the United Nations General Assembly, which relies on a one-person, one-vote governance system, the World Bank uses a weighted voted system. Voting is loosely based on contributions to the Bank. The five largest shareholders (United States, Japan, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) have their own seat on the Executive Board. In addition to the five largest shareholders, China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have enough votes to elect their own executive directors. All other countries have gravitated into mixed-state groupings or constituencies. These constituencies range in size from 3 countries (South Africa, Angola, and Nigeria) to 21. The mixed-state constituencies are flexible in their membership. Countries have periodically switched constituencies, often to a new group that will allow them to have a bigger vote or leadership role. Unlike the eight countries that have their own ED, the influence of countries in mixed-state constituencies is not equivalent to their quota-determined voting weight. Since they vote in constituencies, small countries can easily be sidestepped by the larger countries in the constituency. For many countries at the World Bank, they \"can at best express a divergent opinion orally but cannot bring it to bear in the form of a vote.\" Executive directors must cast their votes as single unit, even though some of the countries they represent may disagree with their position. There is no provision for splitting a constituency's vote. There is no formal congressional involvement in the selection of Bank management. U.S. participation in the World Bank is authorized by the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1945. The act delegates to the President ultimate authority under U.S. law to direct U.S. policy and instruct the U.S. representatives at the Bank. The President, in turn, has generally delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the President names individuals to represent the United States on the Executive Board of the World Bank. The position of U.S. executive director is currently vacant. The alternate executive director is Erik Bethel. The Executive Board has authority over operations and policy and must approve any loan or policy decision. The U.S. executive director is supported primarily by Treasury Department staff. Unique among the founding members, the Bretton Woods Agreement Act requires specific congressional authorization for certain decisions, such as changing the U.S. share at the Bank or amending the Articles of Agreement. However, neither the approval of individual loans nor the selection of the managing director requires congressional approval. The European-U.S. arrangement to split the leadership at the IMF and World Bank has generated controversy, which may undermine the effectiveness of the eventual nominee. Critics of the current selection process make two general arguments. First, the gentlemen's agreement on IMF and World Bank leadership is seen as a relic of a global economy that no longer exists. Whereas the United States and Europe dominated the postwar economy, the current international economy is more diverse. Developing and emerging market countries contribute half of global output, up from 25% 30 years ago. Over the past several decades, the balance of global economic power has been shifting from the United States and Europe to China and a number of other fast-developing countries ( Figure 1 ). These economies account for rising shares of global GDP, manufacturing, and trade, and also are driven by a significant expansion of trade among the developing countries (South-South trade). These shifts are driven by growing economic integration and interdependence among economies, particularly through new global production and supply chains that incorporate inputs from many different countries. In recent years, China has also invested in, created, and led a range of institutions and initiatives, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and other funding mechanisms, such as the Silk Road Fund and the New Development Bank (also known as the BRICS Bank), a collective arrangement with Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. At the same time, China is pursuing its own bilateral and regional trade agreements, such as the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with 15 other countries in the Asia Pacific. China has also positioned itself to act as a lender of last resort through monetary arrangements such as the BRICs Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) and the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM). In such a diverse global economy, any agreement that grants the leadership position based on nationality, critics argue, unnecessarily limits the pool of potential candidates that may be exceptionally competent in addressing the issues before the Bank. \"Since the creation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of the second world war, an American has led the Bank and a European the IMF,\" noted Mark Sobel, U.S. chairman of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), an independent think tank, and former U.S. representative at the IMF. \"It is time for a change.\" According to Nancy Birdsall, senior fellow and founding president of the Center for Global Development, \"the logic of an American president to ensure sustained U.S. support for the World Bank is no longer as clear as it has been.\" According to Birdsall, and others, the Trump Administration's \"America First\" rhetoric may make it harder for the United States to coalesce support for the U.S. candidate. Others argue that these concerns are overblown and that any serious effort to block the U.S. nominee would backfire. David Dollar, a former U.S. Treasury and senior World Bank official, says that, \"it's a very complicated game. My instinct is that there is a very strong likelihood that the U.S. nominee will be approved. The world has an interest in the United States staying engaged with the World Bank.\" Devesh Kapur, a professor at Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, puts it more bluntly, saying \"powerful nations' relationships with the United States matter much more than who heads the World Bank.\" Following Kim's announcement of his resignation, the Bank's Executive Board met on January 9, 2019, and issued a formal statement on the selection process. The nomination period for the next president ends on March 14, after which the Executive Board is to decide on a shortlist of three candidates. Following interviews, the Executive Board aims to select the next president before the spring meetings in April 2019. On February 6, President Trump nominated David Malpass, Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, to be the next World Bank president. Reportedly, Ivanka Trump, President Trump's oldest daughter and senior advisor, played a role in selecting the U.S. nominee. In 2017, Ms. Trump helped start a World Bank-administered fund, the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which aims to generate $1.6 billion in capital for female entrepreneurs. The White House, according to reports, also considered Indra Nooyi, the former chief executive officer of PepsiCo; Ray Washburne, President and Chief Executive of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; Mark Green, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator; and Robert Kimmitt, Deputy Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush.", "answers": ["On January 7, 2018, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim announced that he would resign by February 1, three years before the expiration of his second five-year term in 2022. Following his resignation, Dr. Kim is to join Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a private equity fund that invests in projects in advanced and developing countries. Prior to his nomination to the World Bank by President Barack Obama in 2012, Dr. Kim served as the president of Dartmouth College. The nomination period for the next president ends on March 14, after which the Executive Board is to select three candidates for interviews. To date, the only candidate is David Malpass, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for International Affairs, nominated by President Trump on February 6, 2019. Following the interviews, the Executive Board is to select the next president, something which it aims to do before the spring meetings in April 2019. Since its founding after World War II, the presidency of the World Bank has been held by a citizen of the United States, the Bank's largest shareholder. According to an informal agreement among World Bank member countries, a U.S. candidate is chosen as the president of the World Bank and a European candidate (typically French or German) is appointed as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The formal requirement for the selection of the World Bank president is that the executive directors appoint, by at least a 50% majority, an individual who is neither a member of the Board of Governors nor Board of Executive Directors. There are no requirements on how individuals are selected, on what criteria, or by what process they are vetted. Although the executive directors may select the IMF managing director by a simple majority vote, they historically aim to reach agreement by consensus. With these factors combined, the custom guaranteeing European leadership at the IMF and American leadership at the World Bank has remained in place. This custom has been subject to increasing criticism during the past two decades. The first line of criticism is directed at the current distribution of voting power, which critics contend does not account for the increasing integration of developing countries into the global economy. A second line of criticism is directed at the method of selecting World Bank and IMF leadership, which critics argue elevates nationality above merit and undermines the legitimacy and effectiveness of the institutions. Calls for a more open, transparent, and merit-based leadership selection process have been made consistently in the past, and at times have been incorporated into communiqués of various summits, but have yet to change the leadership selection process at either institution."], "length": 3445, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "dd75bb805b5fc457bdab49c32635ed8024f47048416ab1fe"}
{"input": "", "context": "T he Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury (Title I), the Executive Office of the President (EOP; Title II), the judiciary (Title III), the District of Columbia (Title IV), and more than two dozen independent agencies (Title V). The bill typically funds mandatory retirement accounts in Title VI, which also contains additional general provisions applying to the funding provided to agencies through the FSGG bill. Title VII typically contains general provisions applying government-wide. The FSGG bill has also often contained provisions relating to the U.S. policy toward Cuba. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. Where the CFTC is funded upon enactment depends on which chamber originated the law, which typically alternates annually. Thus, the enacted amounts for the CFTC typically are in the Agriculture appropriations bill one year and FSGG the following year. This structure has existed in its current form since the 2007 reorganization of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Although financial services are a major focus of the bill, the FSGG appropriations bill does not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are instead funded outside of the appropriations process. It is not uncommon for legislative provisions addressing various financial regulatory issues to be included in titles at the end of the bill. President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. This total included a proposed legislative provision on government-wide transfer authority in Section 737, which was estimated at $3 billion by the appropriations committees. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 ( H.R. 6258 , H.Rept. 115-792 ) on June 15, 2018. Total FY2019 funding in the reported bill would have beeen $45.7 billion, with another $255 million for the CFTC included in the Agriculture appropriations bill ( H.R. 5961 , H.Rept. 115-706 ). The combined total of $45.9 billion would have been about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA) and in language relating to government-wide transfers that was requested by the President but not included in the legislation (Section 737). H.R. 6258 was included as Division B of H.R. 6147 , the Interior appropriations bill, when it was considered by the House of Representatives beginning on July 17, 2018. The bill was amended numerous times, shifting funding among FSGG agencies but not changing the FSGG totals. H.R. 6147 passed the House on July 19, 2018. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported a Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 ( S. 3107 , S.Rept. 115-281 ) on June 28, 2018. Funding in S. 3107 totaled $45.9 billion, about $3.2 billion below the President's FY2019 request, with the largest differences in the funding for the GSA and in the government-wide transfers requested language (Section 737). The Senate began floor consideration of H.R. 6147 on July 24, 2018, including the text of S. 3107 as Division B of the amendment in the nature of a substitute ( S.Amdt. 3399 ). The amendment also included three other appropriations bills. The amended version of H.R. 6147 was passed by the Senate on August 1, 2018. The conference committee on H.R. 6147 convened on September 13, 2018. No conference report was reported, however, prior to the end of the fiscal year. Instead, Division C of P.L. 115-245 , enacted on September 28, 2018, generally provided for continuing appropriations at FY2018 levels for the FSGG agencies through December 7, 2018. A further continuing resolution ( P.L. 115-298 ) was passed providing funding through December 21, 2018. No additional appropriations were passed in the 115 th Congress, leading to a funding lapse for the FSGG agencies as well as those funded in six other appropriations bills beginning on December 22, 2018. The House of Representatives passed two consolidated appropriations bills in January 2019. H.R. 21 —which contained six full FY2019 appropriations bills, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to those passed by the Senate in the 115 th Congress—passed on January 3, 2019. H.R. 21 would have provided a total of $45.9 billion for the FSGG agencies, with the CFTC funding included with FSGG funding in Division B, following the Senate structure. On January 23, 2019, the House passed H.R. 648 , also containing the same six full FY2019 appropriations bills, which was reportedly based on a potential conference report from the 115 th Congress. H.R. 648 would have provided $46.0 billion for the FSGG agencies, with the FSGG portion—including CFTC funding—in Division C. Neither of these bills included the financial regulatory provisions in Title IX of the House-passed bill in the 115 th Congress. The Senate did not act on either of these bills. On February 14, 2019, the House and the Senate agreed to a conference report ( H.Rept. 116-9 ) on H.J.Res 31 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, containing seven appropriations bills. This act provides full FY2019 funding for the government's operations that had not been previously funded, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to H.R. 648 , but located in Division D. The primary substantive differences were in the Department of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund and in funding for GSA. The President signed the resolution on February 15, 2019, enacting it into law as P.L. 116-6 . P.L. 116-6 included $45.7 billion in FSGG funding, including the CFTC. It did not include the Title IX financial regulatory provisions passed by the House in the 115 th Congress. The final total was approximately $3.4 billion less than the President's request, with most of the difference coming from the Section 737 transfer authority, which was not included by Congress. Other notable differences included the funding for the GSA and the Executive Office of the President. Table 1 below reflects the status of FSGG appropriations measures at key points in the appropriations process across the 115 th and 116 th Congresses. Table 2 lists the broad amounts requested by the President and included in the various FSGG bills, largely by title, and Table 3 details the amounts for the independent agencies. Specific columns in Table 2 and Table 3 are FSGG agencies' enacted amounts for FY2018, the President's FY2019 request, the FY2019 amounts from the 115 th Congress bills ( H.R. 6147 as passed by the House and H.R. 6147 as passed by the Senate), the FY2019 amounts from the 116 th Congress House-passed bills ( H.R. 21 and H.R. 648 ), and the final FY2019 enacted amounts from P.L. 116-6 . Although financial services are a focus of the FSGG bill, the bill does not actually include funding for the regulation of much of the financial services industry. Financial services as an industry is often subdivided into banking, insurance, and securities. Federal regulation of the banking industry is divided among the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (generally known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB). In addition, credit unions, which operate similarly to many banks, are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). None of these agencies receives its primary funding through the appropriations process, with only the FDIC inspector general and a small NCUA-operated program currently funded in the FSGG bill. Insurance is generally regulated at the state level, with some Federal Reserve oversight at the holding company level. There is a relatively small Federal Insurance Office (FIO) inside the Treasury, which is funded through the Departmental Offices account, but FIO has no regulatory authority. Federal securities regulation is divided between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC, both of which are funded through appropriations. The CFTC funding is a relatively straightforward appropriation from the general fund, whereas the SEC funding is provided by the FSGG bill, but then offset through fees collected by the SEC. Although funding for many financial regulatory agencies may not be provided by the FSGG bill, legislative provisions affecting financial regulation in general and some of these agencies specifically have often been included in FSGG bills. In the 115 th Congress, H.R. 6258 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the House included many provisions, particularly in Title IX, that would have amended the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and other statutes relating to the regulation of financial institutions and the authority and funding of financial regulators. Many of these provisions were included in other legislation, notably H.R. 10 , which passed the House on June 8, 2017, and S. 488 as amended by the House, which passed the House on July 17, 2018, though neither of these bills were enacted in the 115 th Congress. Of particular interest from the appropriations perspective, H.R. 6258 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the House would have brought the CFPB under the FSGG bill instead of receiving funding from outside of the appropriations process, as is currently the case. S. 3107 and H.R. 6147 as passed by the Senate did not include similar provisions affecting the CFPB or other aspects of financial regulation as in Title IX of the House bills. In the 116 th Congress, the bills passed by the House ( H.R. 21 and H.R. 648 ) did not include financial regulatory provisions similar to those in the 115 th Congress House-passed bill, and neither did the enacted P.L. 116-6 . The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reorganized their subcommittee structures in early 2007. Each chamber created a new Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee. In the House, the FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction is primarily composed of agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies, commonly referred to as TTHUD. In addition, the House FSGG Subcommittee was assigned four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Subcommittee: the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the SEC, and the Small Business Administration (SBA). In the Senate, the new FSGG Subcommittee's jurisdiction is a combination of agencies from the jurisdiction of three previously existing subcommittees. Most of the agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee were assigned to the FSGG subcommittee. In addition, the District of Columbia, which had its own subcommittee in the 109 th Congress, was placed under the purview of the FSGG Subcommittee, as were four independent agencies that had been under the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee: the FCC, FTC, SEC, and SBA. As a result of this reorganization, the House and Senate FSGG Subcommittees have nearly identical jurisdictions, except that the CFTC is under the jurisdiction of the FSGG Subcommittee in the Senate and the Agriculture Subcommittee in the House. Table 4 below lists various departments and agencies funded through FSGG appropriations and the CRS experts' names pertaining to these departments and agencies.", "answers": ["The Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill includes funding for the Department of the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President (EOP), the judiciary, the District of Columbia, and more than two dozen independent agencies. The House and Senate FSGG bills fund the same agencies, with one exception. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is usually funded through the Agriculture appropriations bill in the House and the FSGG bill in the Senate. President Trump submitted his FY2019 budget request on February 12, 2018. The request included a total of $49.1 billion for agencies funded through the FSGG appropriations bill, including $282 million for the CFTC. The $49.1 billion figure includes $3 billion for a legislative provision on government-wide transfers (Section 737). The 115th Congress House and Senate Committees on Appropriations reported FSGG appropriations bills (H.R. 6258, H.Rept. 115-792 and S. 3107, S.Rept. 115-281) and both houses passed different versions of a broader bill (H.R. 6147) that would have provided FY2019 appropriations. The House-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided a combined total of $45.9 billion for the FSGG agencies, while the Senate-passed H.R. 6147 would have provided $45.7 billion. In both cases, the largest differences compared to the President's request were in the funding for the General Services Administration (GSA), the funding for the Executive Office of the President, and the absence of the Section 737 provision on government-wide transfers in both bills. No full-year FY2019 FSGG bill was enacted prior to the end of FY2018. The FSGG agencies were provided continuing appropriations until December 7, 2018, in P.L. 115-245 and until December 21, 2018, in P.L. 115-298. No final bill was enacted, and funding for FSGG agencies, along with much of the rest of the government, lapsed on December 22, 2018. No further appropriations occurred prior to the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 21, which contained six full FY2019 appropriations bills, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to those passed by the Senate in the 115th Congress on January 3, 2019. On January 23, 2019, the House passed H.R. 648, also containing six appropriations bills, which was reportedly based on a potential conference report from the 115th Congress and would have provided $46.0 billion for FSGG appropriations. (Neither of these bills provided full-year funding for the Department of Homeland Security.) The Senate did not act on either of these bills. On February 14, 2019, both the House and the Senate passed a conference report (H.Rept. 116-9) for H.J.Res. 31, containing seven appropriations bills providing full FY2019 funding for the government's operations that had not been previously funded, including FSGG provisions nearly identical to H.R. 648. The President signed the resolution on February 15, 2019, enacting it into law as P.L. 116-6. The law provides $45.7 billion in the FSGG appropriations portion (Division D), which includes the funding for the CFTC. This is $3.4 billion less than the President's request, with the bulk of this due to the absence of the Section 737 transfer authority in P.L. 116-6. Other notable differences include the funding for GSA and the Executive Office of the President. Although financial services are a major focus of the FSGG appropriations bills, these bills do not include funding for many financial regulatory agencies, which are funded outside of the appropriations process. The FSGG bills have, however, often contained additional legislative provisions relating to such agencies, as is the case with H.R. 6258/H.R. 6147 in the 115th Congress, whose Title IX contained language from a number of different bills relating to financial regulation. P.L. 116-6 did not contain this language."], "length": 2490, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "1a7bf80c730cbafed9c6b9467d47cc81282d37cf2536e99d"}

{"input": "", "context": "Both the Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101 st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" Use of the Capitol Grounds requires either the passage of a concurrent resolution or permit approval from the Capitol Police. Events that entail the use of the West Front Steps of the Capitol, electricity on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, require more than 24 hours from setup to cleanup, require vehicles on Capitol Grounds for setup, or will have a large number of Members in attendance typically require a concurrent resolution. All other events can typically be issued permits by the U.S. Capitol Police. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. Additionally, Congress has provided an ongoing authorization for holiday concerts on Capitol Grounds. Held on Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, and Labor Day, these concerts feature the National Symphony Orchestra and are free and open to the public. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st through the 115 th Congresses (1989-2018). The search was conducted by running a query across all agreed-to concurrent resolutions using the subject term \"rotunda.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Rotunda from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The search identified a total of 99 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between one and nine concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Rotunda. Table 1 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix A , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category and examples of activities. Table 2 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989, by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions (34.3%) authorized the use of the Rotunda for a commemoration ceremony, often of an historical event. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of the commemoration of the days of remembrance of victims of the Holocaust were passed during each Congress. In recent Congresses, resolutions were also agreed to for Rotunda ceremonies to commemorate the 60 th anniversary of the integration of the U.S. Armed Forces, the 200 th birthday of Constantino Brumidi, the 50 th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, and the 50 th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Ceremonies to award Congressional Gold Medals account for 24.2% of the concurrent resolutions for the use of the Rotunda agreed to since the 101 st Congress. These award ceremonies include presentations of Congressional Gold Medals to Rosa Parks, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, the Tuskegee Airmen, and other recipients. Since the 101 st Congress, 15.2% of concurrent resolutions have been agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for ceremonies to unveil artwork. These have included unveiling ceremonies for portrait busts of former Vice Presidents, as well as presentation ceremonies of statues prior to placement in Statuary Hall. In preparation for the quadrennial Presidential inauguration activities that take place at the Capitol, concurrent resolutions were passed during the 102 nd , 104 th , 106 th , 108 th , 110 th , 112 th , 113 th , and 115 th Congresses. These resolutions have authorized the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to use the Rotunda \"in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.\" Since the 101 st Congress, 10.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities. Since the 101 st Congress, 6.1% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for the purposes of receiving foreign dignitaries or honoring a living person. For example, during the 102 nd Congress, use of the Rotunda was authorized for a ceremony and reception for the Dalai Lama. During the 105 th Congress, use of the Rotunda was authorized for a ceremony honoring Mother Teresa. During the 114 th Congress, the use of the Rotunda was authorized for events surrounding the visit by His Holiness Pope Francis to address a joint session of Congress. Use of the Rotunda for individuals to lie in state or honor accounted for 8.1% of Rotunda events authorized by concurrent resolution. These events have included President Reagan, Senator Claude Pepper, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye lying in state; Rosa Parks lying in honor; and the memorial service for Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut of the U.S. Capitol Police. In the 115 th Congress, one individual—Reverend Billy Graham—lay in honor, while two—Senator John McCain and President George H.W. Bush—lay in state. On two occasions during the 107 th Congress (2.0%), concurrent resolutions were agreed to for the use of the Rotunda for prayer vigils. H.Con.Res. 233 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a prayer vigil in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. S.Con.Res. 83 authorized the use of the Rotunda for a ceremony as part of a National Day of Reconciliation. A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 101 st to the 115 th Congresses (1989-2019). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Capitol Grounds.\" The results of the search were then examined individually to differentiate resolutions for the use of the Capitol Grounds from references to it in otherwise unrelated legislation. The uses of the Capitol Grounds identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 112 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 101 st Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 3 and 14 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds. Table 3 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix B , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds can be divided into one of four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on the Capitol Grounds. Table 4 contains the number of concurrent resolutions agreed to by Congress since 1989 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (65.5%) authorized events that are sponsored by nonfederal-government entities. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby and the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Relay are typically agreed to each Congress. Memorial services held on the Capitol Grounds account for 23% of the concurrent resolutions passed since the 101 st Congress. Each year since 1989, the House and Senate have agreed to a concurrent resolution allowing the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be conducted on Capitol Grounds. The ceremony honors law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty during the previous year. Events sponsored by the federal government compose 8.8% of events on the Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolution. These events have included authorizing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to hold performances on the East Front of the Capitol, allowing the National Book Festival to run programs on the Capitol Grounds, and authorizing a celebration for the Library of Congress's 200 th birthday. Award and dedication ceremonies account for 2.7% of events authorized by concurrent resolution for the Capitol Grounds. Since 1989, three award and dedication ceremonies have been authorized through concurrent resolution. In the 106 th Congress (1999-2001), Congress authorized the use of the Capitol Grounds for the dedication of the Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism; in the 108 th Congress (2003-2005), the dedication ceremony for the National World War II Memorial was authorized for the Capitol Grounds; and in the 110 th Congress (2007-2009), the presentation ceremony for the Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, took place on the Capitol Grounds. Upon the completion and opening of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC) during the 110 th Congress, Emancipation Hall of the CVC became available for use in the same manner as the Rotunda and Capitol Grounds. Use of Emancipation Hall requires the passage of a resolution agreed to by both houses of Congress authorizing its use. The first concurrent resolution authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall was agreed to during the 110 th Congress. It provided for the use of the Hall in connection with \"ceremonies and activities held in connection with the opening of the Capitol Visitor Center to the public.\" Consistent with previous resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda, the concurrent resolution for the use of Emancipation Hall directed that physical preparations be carried out \"in accordance with such conditions as the Architect of the Capitol may provide.\" A database search was conducted using Congress.gov for the 110 th through the 115 th Congresses (2007-2017). The search was conducted by running a query using the subject term \"Emancipation Hall.\" The uses of Emancipation Hall identified here are restricted to those authorized by concurrent resolution of the House and Senate. The search identified a total 43 concurrent resolutions that were agreed to by the House and Senate. Between the 110 th Congress and the 115 th Congress, the House and Senate agreed to between 1 and 15 concurrent resolutions per Congress that authorized the use of Emancipation Hall. Table 5 reports the total number of resolutions agreed to in each Congress. Appendix C , which lists the results of the database search, provides the following information for each concurrent resolution: the Congress in which the resolution was introduced, the resolution number, and the subject of the resolution. Concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall can be divided into one of four categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies, (2) congressional gold medal ceremonies, (3) artwork unveilings, and (4) presidential inauguration activities. The following sections provide a brief explanation of each category with examples of the types of activities concurrent resolutions provided for on Emancipation Hall. Table 6 contains the number of concurrent resolution agreed to by Congress since 2007 by category. The largest percentage of concurrent resolutions agreed to (46.5%) authorized the use of Emancipation Hall for commemoration ceremonies. For example, concurrent resolutions authorizing the use of Emancipation Hall are agreed to annually to celebrate the birthday of King Kamehameha. Ceremonies to award Congressional Gold Medals account for 32.6% of the concurrent resolutions for the use of Emancipation Hall agreed to since the 110 th Congress. These award ceremonies include presentations of Congressional Gold Medals to Women Air Force Service Pilots, the Montford Point Marines, and Native American Code Talkers. Since the 110 th Congress, 11.6% of concurrent resolutions have been agreed to for the use of Emancipation Hall for ceremonies to unveil artwork. These have included unveiling ceremonies for a bust of Sojourner Truth, a marker acknowledging the role of slaves in building the Capitol, a statue of Frederick Douglass, and the American Prisoners of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Chair of Honor. Since Emancipation Hall opened in the middle of the 110 th Congress, Congress has also utilized the space for inaugural activities. Just like the resolutions authorizing the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities, these resolutions have authorized the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies to use Emancipation Hall \"in connection with the proceedings and ceremonies conducted for the inauguration of the President-elect and the Vice President-elect of the United States.\" Since the 110 th Congress, 9.3% of concurrent resolutions have authorized the use of the Rotunda for inaugural activities.

Concurrent Resolutions Agreed to for the Use of Emancipation Hall", "answers": ["The Capitol Rotunda and the Capitol Grounds have been used as the setting for a variety of events, ranging from memorial ceremonies and the reception of foreign dignitaries to the presentation of awards and the hosting of public competitions. This report identifies and categorizes uses of the Capitol Rotunda and Capitol Grounds authorized by concurrent resolutions since the 101st Congress. In most cases, use of the Capitol Rotunda requires a concurrent resolution agreed to by both the House and Senate. A concurrent resolution for the use of the Rotunda typically identifies the event and date for which use is authorized. Often, the resolution also directs physical preparations to be carried out under the supervision of the Architect of the Capitol. Ninety-nine concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Rotunda between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into seven categories: (1) commemoration ceremonies; (2) Congressional Gold Medal ceremonies; (3) artwork unveilings; (4) presidential inauguration activities; (5) receptions or ceremonies honoring living people; (6) persons lying in state or honor; and (7) prayer vigils. Use of the Capitol Grounds can be authorized either by the passage of a concurrent resolution or through an application process with the Capitol Police. A concurrent resolution is typically needed for events longer than 24 hours in duration, for events that require vehicles on the Capitol Grounds for setup, for events requiring electronics on the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol, and for events where a large number of Members will be in attendance. The Capitol Police's special events office handles permits and approval for all other events. One hundred twelve concurrent resolutions were agreed to by the House and the Senate authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds between the 101st and the 115th Congresses. These resolutions can be divided into four categories: (1) events sponsored by nonfederal-government groups; (2) memorial services; (3) events sponsored by the federal government; and (4) award and dedication ceremonies.

{"input": "", "context": "DOD, through the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, develops department-wide strategic guidance based on direction from the President and issues this guidance through strategy documents. According to joint doctrine and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff guidance, combatant commanders use strategy documents as guidance for planning operations. Specifically, combatant commanders translate this guidance into their commands’ campaign and contingency plans. The military services organize, train, equip, and provide forces to the combatant commanders to execute command plans. The combatant commander must make certain the combatant command can execute these plans. PACOM is one of six geographic Unified Combatant Commands of the U.S. Armed Forces. With an area of responsibility extending from the waters off the west coast of the United States to the western border of India, and from Antarctica to the North Pole, PACOM is the primary U.S. military authority in the Pacific. In 2016, PACOM reported that approximately 380,000 U.S. military and civilian personnel were assigned to this area. PACOM describes the 36 nations that comprise the Asia- Pacific region as home to more than 50 percent of the world’s population and 3,000 different languages, several of the world’s larger militaries, and five nations allied with the United States through mutual defense treaties or agreements. PACOM’s commander reports to the President and the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and is supported by four service component commands: U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Pacific Air Forces, U.S. Army Pacific, and U.S. Marine Forces, Pacific. In President Obama’s speech to the Australian Parliament in November 2011, he stated that after a decade of fighting two wars, the United States was turning its attention to the vast potential of the Asia-Pacific region. The President described the U.S. as a historic Pacific power whose interests are inextricably linked with Asia’s economic, security, and political order. According to a senior administration official, the United States planned to implement a comprehensive, multidimensional strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. PACOM used military strategy documents to implement presidential strategic direction to rebalance efforts to the Pacific. However, according to officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, these officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific effort. Based on our interviews with U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and DOD officials, we focused our review on six strategy documents, issued between 2012 and 2015, that these officials considered relevant and representative of DOD’s previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific through 2016. The six documents that we reviewed are: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense. DOD issued this document in January 2012. This publication reflected presidential strategic direction to DOD and described the key military missions for which the department would prepare. In describing the security environment, this strategic guidance stated that the United States would, of necessity, rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region. Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). According to DOD guidance, the QDR articulates a national defense strategy consistent with the broader government-wide National Security Strategy by defining force structure, modernization plans, and a budget plan allowing the military to successfully execute the full range of missions within that strategy. The 2014 QDR referred to the rebalance to the Pacific as a part of sustaining U.S. presence and posture abroad to better protect U.S. national security interests. National Military Strategy (NMS). The 2015 NMS described how DOD would employ military forces to protect and advance U.S. national interests. The NMS provided focus for military activities by defining a set of military objectives and concepts used by the combatant commanders and others. The 2015 NMS referenced the rebalance to the Pacific as part of a national military objective. The NMS was informed by the QDR. Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF). According to joint doctrine, the GEF provides direction to combatant commands for operational planning, force management, security cooperation, and posture planning. The GEF is the method through which the Secretary of Defense translates strategic priorities in the QDR and other strategy documents into direction for operational activities. The GEF is described in joint doctrine as an essential document for combatant command planners as it provides the strategic end states for the deliberate planning of campaign and contingency plans. Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The JSCP is the primary vehicle through which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff directs the preparation of joint plans. The JSCP provides military strategic and operational guidance to combatant commanders for the preparation of plans based on current military capabilities. The JSCP tasks combatant commanders to develop campaign, contingency, and posture plans and translates requirements from the GEF and other guidance into prioritized military missions, tasks, and plans. The JSCP is informed by the GEF and the NMS. PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) (TCP). Campaign plans, such as PACOM’s TCP, focus on the combatant command’s steady-state or daily activities and operationalize combatant command theater strategies. According to joint doctrine, joint planning draws from tasks identified in the GEF and JSCP and campaign plans should focus on the combatant command’s steady-state activities. These include ongoing operations, military engagement, security cooperation, deterrence, and other shaping or preventive activities. Campaign plans provide the vehicle for linking steady-state shaping activities to the attainment of strategic and military end states. In January 2018, DOD announced its new 2018 National Defense Strategy that cited as the department’s principal priorities the long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The strategy also stated that concurrently the department would sustain its efforts to deter and counter rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran, defeat terrorist threats to the United States, and consolidate gains in Iraq and Afghanistan while moving to a more resource-sustainable approach. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs notified GAO that although DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. Six DOD strategy documents that helped guide the rebalance to the Pacific collectively included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. We have previously reported that effective national strategies incorporate six characteristics, and their associated desired elements. Table 1 lists desired elements that we adapted from our prior work and tailored toward our review of the six DOD strategy documents. We found these six DOD strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included, to varying degrees, 24 of the 31 desired elements we determined as being the most relevant to an effective strategy for the rebalance. For example, as a set, the six strategy documents contained a detailed description of the operating environment in which activities for the rebalance were to take place and included references that described the relationship of the rebalance to the Pacific to other strategies, goals, and objectives. The strategy documents referenced their purposes and, in unclassified and general descriptions, the threats that the strategies were to address including long-range missile threats and weapons of mass destruction. Collectively, the strategy documents referred to selected types of resources needed, such as the deployment of ships and aviation assets, and who would be implementing the strategies. We were, however, unable to find any reference to 7 of the 31 elements in any of the six strategy documents. For example, 2 of the 7 missing elements were: Lack of a documented, consistent definition of the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD’s six strategy documents issued from 2012 to 2015 included a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific that described the rebalance’s key terms, major functions, mission areas or activities. Further, DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the Joint Staff, and the U.S. Pacific Command involved in planning and implementing the rebalance to the Pacific were unable to identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents, and consequently could not provide a definition that was in use consistently across the department. During discussions about the absence of a definition, these PACOM officials told us that all PACOM activities were rebalance activities, even activities that were underway before the President’s announcement to rebalance. Senior DOD policy officials referred us to the speeches of senior administration officials given since the President’s 2011 address to derive the definition of the rebalance. However, as noted earlier, after the President’s speech in 2011, there were a number of pronouncements from senior administration officials that varied over time. The lack of consistent attributes to a strategy can make it difficult for policy makers to assess its effectiveness and accountability. Lack of a documented end state for the rebalance to the Pacific. Based on our systematic review, we found that none of DOD’s six strategy documents from 2012 to 2015 identified an end state for the rebalance to the Pacific. Identifying the end state is a desired element associated with establishing goals and objectives for effective strategies and plans. Joint doctrine also states that military planners must know where to look for the guidance to ensure that plans are consistent with national priorities and are directed toward achieving national security goals and objectives. A national strategy that identified the end state of the rebalance could distinguish new efforts from the longstanding U.S. military presence in the region, and the associated increase in resources to support the post-2011 rebalancing. For example, we found a lack of clarity concerning the end state for the rebalance. DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Joint Staff, and PACOM—whom we interviewed because they were involved in planning and implementing the rebalance to the Pacific—said that they were unaware of an end state for DOD’s efforts to rebalance. The same officials told us that there was no foreseeable end state because, as long as the Asia-Pacific region was important to the U.S., the focus would remain on the region. However, officials from different military service components told us that their individual services had an end state for their service-specific activities to support the rebalance. For example, officials from U.S. Army Pacific told us that they had completed their service’s rebalance. They stated that they achieved the end state with the completion of force posture changes and that some efforts supporting rebalancing had begun before rebalancing was inaugurated. In contrast, a Marine Corps official in the Pacific reported there was no end state for rebalancing. According to the official, Marine Corps activities such as posture realignments supported rebalancing, but these longstanding activities were ongoing prior to the President’s announcement to rebalance. Moreover, we found a lack of an awareness of a command-wide end state for rebalancing and coordination among the various military service activities in support of rebalancing. It was unclear how service-defined end states could have been fully integrated or prioritized for funding without a consistent overall end state for DOD’s overall effort. In such instances, a department-wide defined end state could have helped with the allocation of resources because the most important priorities would be known. A clear and consistent definition for rebalance and the identification of an end state, as well as the inclusion of the other 5 missing elements, could have better positioned decision makers to effectively plan, manage, and assess DOD’s progress toward rebalancing efforts to the Pacific. According to DOD officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy responsible for policy for the rebalance to the Pacific, the speeches by senior administration officials between 2012 and 2015 supplanted the need to identify and document a definition of the rebalance or an end state in a strategy document. However, as noted earlier, these statements included varying descriptions of the strategy and objectives over time. According to a DOD official from an office with department-wide performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative’s strategic objectives, or end state, were both important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a definition could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance to rebalance from those activities that were routine or peripheral to that effort. Further, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress toward a particular goal, and as described in joint doctrine, facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states (one of the desired elements of an effective national strategy that is also discussed in joint doctrine) —as well as the other missing elements— could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review. DOD had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the Secretaries of the military departments.

Contact points for our Office of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix II. To determine the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) has developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that include desired elements of an effective national strategy, we conducted a search of the literature, from January 2010 to July 2015, to identify official statements on, guidance for, and studies of DOD’s implementation of the rebalance to the Pacific. We reviewed department guidance, such as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructions and joint publications, to understand DOD’s processes and procedures for developing and disseminating guidance and strategic plans. We also interviewed DOD officials from numerous organizations listed below who were involved with planning, providing guidance or implementing the rebalance to the Pacific to identify DOD’s rebalance efforts and whether a strategy or strategies existed that focused on or included the rebalance. The organizations contacted included: Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Chief Financial Officer Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer, Deputy’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities Director of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Cost Assessment U.S. Marines Corps Forces, Pacific U.S. Pacific Air Forces U.S. Transportation Command Based on these interviews and written responses to questions we submitted to the officials associated with these organizations, officials identified documentation and speeches that they indicated informed DOD organizations about implementing the rebalance. Also, based on this information, we found that there was not a single strategy or plan that provided guidance for or outlined DOD’s implementation of the rebalance to the Pacific. Instead, DOD officials from multiple offices identified a number of strategy documents that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including government-wide documents. Based on our interviews with U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and DOD officials, we focused our review on the six selected strategy documents, issued between 2012 and 2015, that these officials considered relevant and representative of DOD’s previous strategy to implement the rebalance to the Pacific. Those six strategy documents are described earlier in the main report. We reviewed and analyzed these six strategy documents to determine whether, as a set, they included the 31 desired elements of the associated key characteristics of an effective national strategy. Our prior work on effective national strategies included examples of desired elements that we adapted and tailored toward our review of DOD strategy documents. We selected 31 desired elements as most relevant to DOD’s rebalance effort and for systematically reviewing DOD’s strategy documents associated with the rebalance. These elements and associated key characteristics are described in table 2 below. To determine whether as a set these strategy documents included the desired elements of an effective national strategy, we reviewed each strategy document using a scorecard method, using the following steps: First, we developed scorecards with a two-level scale of “address” and “did not address.” We used a binary scale of “address” or “did not address” and scored a passage as “address” if it included any part of an element description in order to provide the widest latitude in determining whether the selected passage included the specific element. Also, we used 31 desired elements from the six characteristics to make the comparison because these elements provided more specificity than the broad six characteristics. Second, analysts reviewed all of the selected passages from each strategy document and determined whether they were relevant to understanding the rebalance to the Pacific in order to reach agreement on which passages they would consider in the comparison to the desired elements. The readers agreed upon the inclusion and exclusion of passages before assessing whether these passages included the desired elements. Third, two analysts reviewed the relevant passages in each strategy document related to the rebalance and determined whether or not the passages included the element. The analysts used the scorecards to score each passage. Fourth, upon completion of the independent scoring process for each strategy document, the analysts compared their respective scores and reconciled any differences, thereby reaching a consensus on the final score. As needed, a third analyst facilitated reconciliations where there was a difference in the assessment reached by the individual analysts and documented the consensus results. Lastly, upon completion of scoring, the team compiled and summarized the results. To further corroborate our systematic review of the six strategy documents, we asked officials from DOD organizations responsible for the Asia-Pacific region a standard set of related questions. We asked officials these questions in order to obtain DOD’s perspective regarding the applicability of using the selected desired elements and associated key characteristics in reviewing these specific DOD strategy documents. We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to May 2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Rebalancing to the Pacific became strategic guidance that informed military planning. By the end of 2015, DOD published strategy documents that included references to the rebalance to the Pacific or related concepts. In February 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs stated that while DOD continues to prioritize the Asia-Pacific region, the rebalance to the Pacific is no longer U.S. policy. DOD has published the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which establishes an objective of maintaining a favorable regional balance in the Pacific region, among other regions. Prior to the change in policy, House Report 114-102 included a provision for GAO to review matters related to the U.S. rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region. GAO evaluated the extent to which DOD developed strategy documents to guide the rebalance to the Pacific that included desired elements of an effective national strategy. GAO analyzed six DOD strategy documents that officials identified as providing guidance for the rebalance to the Pacific to determine whether, as a set, they included desired elements associated with an effective national strategy. DOD had no comments on this report. Department of Defense (DOD) strategy documents that collectively guided the rebalance to the Pacific included most of the desired elements of an effective national strategy. The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), which is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region, used DOD strategy documents to implement the President's direction to rebalance to the Pacific, which generally refocused U.S. efforts to that region. PACOM officials told GAO that there was no single rebalance-specific strategy document. Instead, officials identified a number of strategy documents published since 2012 that guided activities associated with the rebalance to the Pacific, including: Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense ; Quadrennial Defense Review ; National Military Strategy ; Guidance for the Employment of the Force ; Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan ; and the PACOM 2015 Theater Campaign Plan (DRAFT) . Based on GAO's analysis, DOD's six strategy documents that guided the rebalance to the Pacific included 24 of the 31 desired elements of an effective national strategy. However, two key elements were missing from the group of strategy documents: (1) a definition of the rebalance to the Pacific, and (2) the identification of the overall results desired, or end state, for the rebalance. DOD officials also could not identify a definition for the rebalance to the Pacific in the strategy documents or provide a definition that was used consistently across the department. According to a DOD official with performance management responsibilities, defining the rebalance to the Pacific and identifying the initiative's strategic objectives, or end state, were important for establishing accountability and measuring progress. For instance, a clear definition of rebalance could have helped those charged with implementation to distinguish activities essential to operationalizing the strategic guidance from activities that were peripheral to that effort. Similarly, knowing the end state could have helped management make the best use of resources, enable the assessment of progress, and facilitate the development of strategic and military objectives. In moving forward in the Asia-Pacific region, considering the identification of strategic end states as well as other missing elements could help position DOD to achieve its objectives in the region."], "length": 3841, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c70a7894fa37b1dd357d3d131a751abd235f4e813e0253c1"}
{"input": "", "context": "Our report noted that IRS has established organizational structures essential to supporting its taxpayer authentication efforts. Specifically, IRS created an Identity Assurance Office (IAO) in 2015 to work with stakeholders across IRS to review and assess the agency’s various authentication programs and efforts. In 2016, IAO led an effort that identified over 100 interactions between IRS and taxpayers that require authentication and categorized these interactions based on potential risks to the agency and taxpayers. Further, in December 2016, IAO released its Roadmap for developing a modern and secure authentication environment for all taxpayers regardless of how they interact with IRS— online, over the telephone, in person, or via correspondence. We also found that IRS is working to address its authentication challenges by collaborating with industry members and state partners via the Security Summit. The Security Summit was established in 2015 as an ongoing effort between industry experts from tax software companies, paid preparers, financial institutions, and states to improve information sharing and fraud detection and to address common IDT challenges. The Security Summit’s authentication workgroup leads several initiatives aimed at verifying the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return at the time of filing. One initiative involves analyzing data elements—such as trusted customer requirements and other characteristics of the return— that are collected during the tax return preparation and electronic filing process. In addition, in 2016 the authentication workgroup recommended improved account password standards to help protect taxpayers’ accounts from being taken over by criminals. Overall, we found that officials—representing IRS, industry, and states— expressed positive views about the level of commitment and cooperation guiding the group’s authentication efforts. Officials with whom we spoke stated that they are dedicated to continuing to address authentication issues collaboratively because they have a mutual interest in improving authentication to reduce tax refund fraud. In its Roadmap, IRS outlined six core authentication objectives, 10 high- level strategic efforts, and 14 foundational initiatives to help it address authentication challenges and identify opportunities for future investment. While we found that IRS has made progress on some efforts identified in its Roadmap, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. For example, one of IRS’s foundational initiatives is to send event-driven notifications to taxpayers, such as when they file a return or request a tax transcript. Such notifications could help IRS and taxpayers detect potentially fraudulent activity at the earliest stage and help improve authentication of tax returns. The Roadmap identifies seven supporting activities for this foundational initiative. One is to provide taxpayers with greater control over their online accounts. Another supporting activity is to determine methods for sending notifications to taxpayers about activity on their account. However, IRS has not identified the resources required to complete these activities, and the Roadmap notes that six of the seven activities will take between 6 months to 3 years to complete. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that they had developed business requirements for the foundational initiative to give taxpayers greater control over their online accounts. However, IRS has not identified funding for the initiative’s other supporting activities—such as developing requirements to send push notifications to taxpayers—and implementation will depend on the availability of future resources. In December 2017, IRS officials stated that each of the strategic efforts and foundational initiatives identified in the Roadmap are a high priority, and they are working to address them concurrently while balancing the availability of resources against the greatest threats to the tax environment. As noted in our report, we recognize that a strategy is necessarily high-level and that IRS must remain flexible and use available resources to respond to unexpected threats. Identifying resources and prioritizing activities in its Roadmap will help IRS clarify tradeoffs between costs, benefits, and risks and aid in decision making. Further, such efforts may also help IRS establish clearer timelines and better respond to unexpected events. As such, we recommended that IRS estimate the resources (i.e., financial and human) required for the foundational initiatives and supporting activities identified in its Roadmap and prioritize its foundational initiatives. IRS agreed with our recommendations and is currently working to finalize its overall authentication approach. Given the widespread availability of personally identifiable information that fraudsters can use to perpetrate tax fraud, it is essential for IRS to further strengthen taxpayer authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters’ schemes. In our report, we identified two additional areas that IRS must address to better position the agency and protect taxpayers against future threats. First, we found that IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement NIST’s June 2017 guidance for secure online authentication, however it had not yet established detailed plans, including timelines, milestone dates, and resource needs to fully implement it. Among other things, NIST’s new guidance directs agencies to assess the risk for each component of identity assurance—identity proofing, authentication, and federation— rather than conducting a single risk assessment for the entire process. According to NIST officials, this approach gives agencies flexibility in choosing technical solutions; aligns with existing, standards-based market offerings; is modular and cost-effective; and enhances individual privacy. In short, following NIST’s new guidance will help provide IRS with better risk-based assurance that the person trying to access IRS’s online services is who they claim to be. As noted in our report, IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement the new NIST guidance. These efforts include forming a task force to guide IRS’s implementation of NIST guidance and working with the Security Summit to develop an implementation framework for state and industry partners. IRS has also begun analyzing gaps between IRS’s current authentication procedures and the new guidance. In addition, in December 2017, IRS implemented a more secure online authentication option consistent with the new guidance through its mobile application, IRS2Go. After taxpayers link their IRS online account with the mobile app, they can use it to generate a security code to log into their account. This option provides taxpayers with an alternative to receiving the security code via a text message, which NIST considers to be less secure. We recommended that IRS develop a plan—including a timeline, milestone dates, and resources needed—for implementing changes to its online authentication programs consistent with new NIST guidance, and also implement these improvements. IRS agreed with our recommendations, but noted that its ability to complete these efforts will depend on the availability of resources. Second, we found that IRS lacks a comprehensive, repeatable process to identify and evaluate potential new authentication technologies and approaches. Our discussions with representatives from industry and financial institutions and with government officials indicate that there is no single, ideal online authentication solution that will solve IRS’s challenges related to IDT refund fraud. These representatives advocate an approach to authentication that relies on multiple strategies and sources of information, while giving taxpayers options for further protecting their information. We identified several authentication options in our report that IRS could consider, including the following: Possession-based authentication. This type of authentication offers users a convenient, added layer of security when used as a second factor for accessing websites or systems that would otherwise rely on a username and password for single-factor authentication. For example, as noted in our report, according to an industry official, authentication using a trusted device or “security key” based on Universal Second Factor standards complies with NIST’s new guidance for digital authentication. While IRS is not likely to provide the devices to taxpayers, it could enable its systems to accept these trusted devices as authenticators for taxpayers who elect to use them. Working with trusted partners. IRS could partner with organizations it trusts that are accessible to taxpayers and enable the partners to identity-proof and authenticate taxpayers. Trusted partners could include tax preparers, financial institutions, or other federal or state agencies. In the course of our work, IRS officials stated that they had been exploring such options with both the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; however, at the time of our report, the agencies had not yet made decisions about next steps. Expanding existing IRS services to further protect taxpayers. IRS could expand the functionality of its online account to further protect taxpayers from IDT refund fraud. For example, IRS could develop additional functionality that allows the taxpayer to designate a bank account or a preference for a paper check for receiving a tax refund. If a fraudster filed a return with different information, the return would be automatically rejected. IRS officials told us the agency continually researches new identity assurance processes and technologies and has talked with other agencies, industry groups, and vendors to better understand how particular technology solutions could apply to IRS’s environment. However, during the course of our work, IRS could not provide us evidence of a repeatable, comprehensive process to identify and evaluate available authentication technologies and services. Such a process could compare options for in-house authentication solutions with off-the-shelf solutions based on estimates of cost, schedule, and benefits, as applicable. To this end, we recommended that IRS develop a process to identify and evaluate alternative options for improving taxpayer authentication, including technologies in use by industry, states, or other trusted partners; and based on this approach, include and prioritize these options, as appropriate, in its Roadmap. IRS agreed with these recommendations, but did not provide additional details on how it plans to address them. In conclusion, IRS’s authentication environment is one component of a broad, complex information technology infrastructure, and we have previously reported on the many challenges the agency faces as it modernizes its tax systems. Taxpayer authentication has become more difficult with the wide availability of personally identifiable information and fraudsters’ ability to develop more complex and sophisticated methods to commit fraud undetected. Addressing the issues we describe above could better position IRS to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in its authentication efforts and better protect taxpayers and the Treasury.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has identified over 100 interactions requiring taxpayer authentication based on potential risks to IRS and individuals. IRS authenticates millions of taxpayers each year via telephone, online, in person, and correspondence to ensure that it is interacting with legitimate taxpayers. IRS's estimated costs to authenticate taxpayers vary by channel. IRS has made progress on monitoring and improving authentication, including developing an authentication strategy with high-level strategic efforts. However, it has not prioritized the initiatives supporting its strategy nor identified the resources required to complete them, consistent with program management leading practices. Doing so would help IRS clarify relationships between its authentication efforts and articulate resource needs relative to expected benefits. Further, while IRS regularly assesses risks to and monitors its online authentication applications, it has not established equally rigorous internal controls for its telephone, in-person, and correspondence channels, including mechanisms to collect reliable, useful data to monitor authentication outcomes. As a result, IRS may not identify current or emerging threats to the tax system. IRS can further strengthen authentication to stay ahead of fraudsters. While IRS has taken preliminary steps to implement National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) new guidance for secure digital authentication, it does not have clear plans and timelines to fully implement it by June 2018, as required by the Office of Management and Budget. As a result, IRS may not be positioned to address its most vulnerable authentication areas in a timely manner. Further, IRS lacks a comprehensive process to evaluate potential new authentication technologies.

{"input": "", "context": "With a staff of over 47,000 members, the Coast Guard operates a multimission fleet of 201 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft and over 1,400 boats and ships. Operational control of surface and air assets is divided into two geographic Areas (Pacific and Atlantic), within which are nine Districts consisting of 37 sectors and the stations within them. The Coast Guard’s program oversight, policy development, and personnel administration are carried out at the Coast Guard’s headquarters. As shown in table 1, the Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions identified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended. The Coast Guard manages these missions through six mission programs, also listed in table 1. As part of its marine safety mission, for example, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial fishing vessels, which are part of an industry with one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States. For each of its 11 missions, the Coast Guard has developed goals and targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast Guard’s performance assessment process also includes identifying performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet performance goals. As part of its process, the Coast Guard is to establish targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, according to Coast Guard officials. Each target is set by the Coast Guard, but according to the Coast Guard’s Annual Performance Report (APR), some are derived from external factors. For example, DHS requires that Coast Guard set a 100 percent target for the percent of people in imminent danger saved in the maritime environment. Further, several of the Coast Guard’s assets used to conduct these missions are approaching the end of their intended service lives. As part of its efforts to modernize its assets used to carry out various missions, the Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels, such as the National Security Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter as well as other assets. However, concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort remain as the Coast Guard continues to pursue multiple new acquisitions without long-term planning to guide the affordability of its acquisition portfolio. Figure 1 shows the Coast Guard’s Fast Response Cutter and National Security Cutter. We previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with its performance goal data, for more effective program management. Examples of data limitations that we have recommended that the Coast Guard take action on are below. Improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, we found that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard. As part of its marine safety activities, the Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations. Commercial fishing has one of the highest death rates of any industry in the United States and vessel disasters are the leading cause of fatalities among fishers, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. However, our December 2017 review found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard’s knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard collects some data on commercial fishing vessels that operate in federal waters—including a vessel’s length and construction date—but data on the population of the active U.S. commercial fishing vessel fleet are not complete. Between 2006 and 2015, the Coast Guard investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents that were identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents generally increased over this time period, the number of injuries and fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. However, we could not assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery— meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon, crab) is caught—because the Coast Guard’s data is not complete. Further, we were unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities, because reliable data on certain information needed to do so—including the total number of vessels that are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel operates—are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful to carrying out the Coast Guard’s marine safety mission, which includes enforcing laws to prevent death, injury and property loss in the marine environment. We recommended in our December 2017 report that the Coast Guard ensure that data it collects during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. We also recommended that the Coast Guard work with stakeholders to form a working group to determine an efficient means to establish a reliable estimate of the population of active commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard agreed with both recommendations, and in February 2018 informed us that it is in the process of developing additional data fields to capture more information, such as the fishery in which the commercial fishing is involved, and is engaging stakeholders to establish an appropriate working group. We will continue to monitor these actions. Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission. We reported that the Coast Guard’s strategic allocations of assets were based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance. This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example, agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity. Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard’s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters’ strategic intent, which is based on asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address related risks. We recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field unit input, such as information on assets’ actual performance, to inform more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed us that it plans to address this recommendation through changes to two process documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in March 2018. Improve performance goal data. In our October 2017 review of Coast Guard performance goals, we reported that the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with two of the seven selected performance goals we reviewed, including the five year average number of recreational boating deaths and injuries. In particular, officials believe that many recreational boating injuries that do not require hospitalization are not reported to the Coast Guard. These officials believe that the amount of underreporting may vary over time due to changes in industry trends, making it difficult to accurately determine actual injury rates and program performance. We determined that the data for this performance goal was not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives due to these likely limitations. We found that the Coast Guard did not report the possible extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year 2016 APR. For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard and DHS identified limitations with the number of detected incursions of foreign fishing vessels violating U.S. waters, which is publicly reported in DHS’s APR. DHS’s review of this performance goal, reported in August 2015, raised questions about the validity of this goal—that is, whether it provides a useful measure of the Coast Guard’s performance. Specifically, the review noted that this performance goal is intended to measure a deterrence effect, but doing so is inherently difficult and may lead to contradictory interpretations of performance. In October 2017, we found that the data for this performance goal was sufficiently reliable for our reporting objective purposes, but questions remain about its validity. Reliable data is not a useful indication of performance unless it is also a valid representation of the goal being addressed. DHS officials reported that they did not include a discussion of the limitations for this performance goal in DHS’s fiscal year 2015 APR because the performance goal met the minimum threshold for data reliability despite the goal’s limitations. Coast Guard officials reported they were aware of these limitations and were working with DHS and OMB to improve the performance goal and implement corrective actions within 1 to 2 years. We recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate information on known data reliability limitations and update these documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment. The Coast Guard concurred and in February 2018, informed us that it had taken initial actions to address our recommendation. However, our preliminary review of these actions indicates that further action will be needed to fully address our recommendation, such as documenting and reporting the limitations of performance data. Our previous reports have identified areas in which the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of its data used for reporting on its mission performance and planning. Improve transparency of data on mission performance. In our October 2017 report on performance goals, we found that the Coast Guard’s APR has not been released publicly since 2011 due to a previous DHS leadership decision. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard’s missions. For example, one of the Coast Guard’s missions—defense readiness—has no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard’s APR. Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly releasing their APR; however, DHS’s decision to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard from pursuing the public release of its APR. DHS officials told us that the department is concerned about conflicting information that a component’s APR might present because it is vetted and produced separately from the DHS APR. However, the lack of transparency regarding performance data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete picture of mission performance and can limit effective oversight of Coast Guard operations. As a result, the public and Congress may be unable to determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions. We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the Coast Guard’s public website. The Coast Guard concurred with this recommendation and in February 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that it had completed its 2017 APR and are determining an appropriate approach for making it publicly available. Improve capital planning transparency. In our previously issued work on the Coast Guard’s annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP), we found that the CIP does not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are made as part of the annual budget cycle. We made several recommendations in recent years intended to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult tradeoff decisions it will likely face. The Coast Guard generally concurred with these recommendations and is in various stages of implementation. For example, in 2017 we reported that we have made recommendations that DHS and the Coast Guard take several actions to gain an understanding of what the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission within its likely acquisition funding levels. These recommended actions included the Coast Guard: (1) conducting a comprehensive portfolio review across all its acquisitions to develop revised baselines that meet mission needs and reflect realistic funding scenarios and (2) developing a 20-year plan that identifies all necessary recapitalization efforts and any fiscal resources likely necessary to complete these efforts. For example, in 2014 we recommended the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them. Without these efforts, the Coast Guard will continue, as it has in recent years, to plan its future acquisitions through the annual budgeting process, an approach that has led to delayed and reduced capabilities. In 2016, the Coast Guard revised its 2005 Mission Needs Statement, which provides a basic foundation for long-term investment planning that is to serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of various fleet mixes, and inform the Coast Guard’s CIP. However, the 2016 Mission Needs Statement did not identify specific assets the Coast Guard needs to achieve its missions, nor did it update the annual hours it needs from each asset class to satisfactorily complete its missions. The Coast Guard has stated it is developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition Plan, but it has not stated when the plan will be completed or what will be included in this plan, such as potential trade-offs that could be made across the Coast Guard’s portfolio of acquisitions to better meet mission needs within realistic funding levels. A long-term plan with a tradeoff analysis would facilitate a full understanding of the affordability challenges facing the Coast Guard while it builds the Offshore Patrol Cutter. DHS concurred with our 2014 recommendation, but it is unclear when the Coast Guard plans to complete the 20-year plan. Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and members of the sub- committee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions you may have at this time.

To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency managers must have accurate information and base decisions on sound analyses for effective program management. This statement discusses Coast Guard actions needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management and (2) improve the transparency of its data for reporting on mission performance and planning. This statement is based on relevant products GAO issued from June 2014 through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and management issues, as well as related recommendation follow-up conducted through February 2018. GAO reviewed applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidance. GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials. GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data. GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan. GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

{"input": "", "context": "DHS leads the federal government’s efforts to secure our nation’s public and private critical infrastructure information systems against cyber threats. As part of these efforts, cybersecurity professionals can help to prevent or mitigate the vulnerabilities that could allow malicious individuals and groups access to federal information technology (IT) systems. The ability to secure federal systems depends on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the federal and contractor workforce that designs, develops, implements, secures, maintains, and uses these systems. The Office of Management and Budget has noted that the federal government and private industry face a persistent shortage of cybersecurity and IT talent to implement and oversee information security protections. This shortage may leave federal IT systems vulnerable to malicious attacks. Experienced and qualified cybersecurity professionals are essential in performing DHS’s work to mitigate vulnerabilities in its own and other agencies’ computer systems and to defend against cyber threats. Since 1997, we have identified the protection of federal information systems as a governmentwide high-risk area. In addition, in 2001, we introduced strategic governmentwide human capital management as another area of high risk. We have also identified a number of challenges federal agencies are facing to ensure that they have a sufficient cybersecurity workforce with the skills necessary to protect their information and networks from cyber threats. These challenges pertain to identifying and closing skill gaps as part of a comprehensive workforce planning process, recruiting and retaining qualified staff, and navigating the federal hiring process. In recent years, the federal government has taken various steps aimed at improving the cybersecurity workforce. These include establishing a national initiative to promote cybersecurity training and skills and developing guidance to address cybersecurity workforce challenges. Founded in 2010, the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is a partnership among government, academia, and the private sector, and is coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The NICE mission promotes cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development in coordination with its partners. The initiative’s goal is to increase the number of skilled cybersecurity professionals in order to boost national IT security. In 2013, NICE published the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework to provide a consistent way to define and describe cybersecurity work at any public or private organization, including federal agencies. In 2014, OPM developed guidance for assigning 2-digit employment codes for each cybersecurity work category and specialty area identified in the 2013 NICE framework. Federal agencies can use the codes to identify cybersecurity positions in personnel and payroll systems, such the system of the National Finance Center. To further enhance efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce, NICE subsequently revised the framework in 2017 to include 33 cybersecurity-related specialty areas organized into 7 categories— securely provision, operate and maintain, protect and defend, investigate, collect and operate, analyze, and oversee and govern. The revision defined work roles in specialty areas and cybersecurity tasks for each work role, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities that a person should have in order to perform each work role. Also, in 2017, OPM issued guidance creating a unique 3-digit employment code for each cybersecurity work role. In October 2017, NIST issued guidance that reflected the finalized 2017 NICE framework and included a crosswalk of OPM’s 2-digit employment codes to the 3-digit codes. DHS is the third largest department in the federal government, employing approximately 240,000 people, and operating with an annual budget of about $60 billion, of which about $6.4 billion was reportedly spent on IT in fiscal year 2017. In leading the federal government’s efforts to secure our nation’s public and private critical infrastructure information systems, the department, among other things, collects and shares information related to cyber threats and cybersecurity risks and incidents with other federal partners to enable real-time actions to address these risks and incidents. The department is made up of 15 operational and support components that perform its critical mission functions. Table 1 describes the 6 components that we included in our review. The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to perform workforce assessment-related activities to identify and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions. Specifically, the act called for DHS to: 1. Establish procedures for identifying and categorizing cybersecurity positions and assigning codes to positions (within 90 days of law’s enactment). 2. Identify all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions and determine the work category and specialty area of each. 3. Assign OPM 2-digit employment codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions based on the position’s primary cybersecurity work category and specialty areas, as set forth in OPM’s Guide to Data Standards. In addition, after completing the aforementioned activities, the act called for the department to take steps to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. Specifically, DHS was to: 4. Identify the cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need in the department’s cybersecurity workforce and report to Congress. 5. Submit to OPM an annual report through 2021 that describes work categories and specialty areas of critical need and substantiates the critical need designations. The act required DHS to complete the majority of these activities by specific due dates between March 2015 and September 2016. Within DHS, OCHCO is responsible for carrying out these provisions, including the coordination of the department’s overall efforts to identify, categorize, code, and report its cybersecurity workforce assessment progress to OPM and Congress. The act required DHS to establish procedures to identify and assign the appropriate employment code, in accordance with OPM’s Guide to Data Standards, to all filled and vacant positions with cybersecurity functions by March 2015. In addition, DHS’s April 2016 Cybersecurity Workforce Coding guidance states that components should ensure procedures are in place to monitor and to update the employment codes as positions change over time. Further, the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government recommends that management assign responsibility and delegate authority to key roles and that each component develop individual procedures to implement objectives. The standards also recommend that management periodically review such procedures to see that they are developed, relevant, and effective. DHS OCHCO developed departmental procedures in May 2014 and recommended implementation steps for coding positions with cybersecurity functions for the department’s components. However, OCHCO did not update its procedures to include information on identifying positions and assigning codes until April 2016—13 months after the due date specified by the act. In addition, the procedures were not complete because they did not include information related to identifying and coding vacant positions, as the act required. Moreover, the departmental procedures did not identify the individual within each DHS component who was responsible for leading and overseeing the identification and coding of the component’s cybersecurity positions. Further, although components were able to supplement the departmental procedures by developing their own component-specific procedures for identifying and coding their cybersecurity positions, OCHCO did not review those procedures for consistency with departmental guidance. The department could not provide documentation that OCHCO had verified or reviewed component-developed procedures. In addition, OCHCO officials acknowledged that they had not reviewed the components’ procedures and had not developed a process for conducting such reviews. OCHCO officials stated that several factors had limited their ability to develop the procedures and to review component-developed procedures in a timely and complete manner. These factors were (1) a delayed departmental decision until April 2016 as to whether certain positions should be considered cybersecurity positions; (2) a belief that each component had the best understanding of their human capital systems, so procedure development was best left up to each component; (3) a condition where each of the six selected DHS components recorded and tracked vacant positions differently; and (4) cybersecurity specialty areas for vacant positions were not known until a position description was developed or verified and a hiring action was imminent. Without assurance that procedures are timely, complete, and reviewed, DHS cannot be certain that its components have the procedures to identify and code all positions with cybersecurity functions, as required by the act. Accordingly, our February 2018 report included recommendations that DHS 1) develop procedures on how to identify and code vacant cybersecurity positions, 2) identify the individual in each component who is responsible for leading that component’s efforts in identifying and coding cybersecurity positions, and 3) establish and implement a process to periodically review each component’s procedures for identifying component cybersecurity positions and maintaining accurate coding. DHS concurred with the recommendations and stated that it would implement them by April 30, 2018. The act required DHS to identify all of its cybersecurity positions, including vacant positions, by September 2015. Further, the act called for the department to use OPM’s Guide to Data Standards to categorize the identified positions and determine the work category or specialty area of each position. As of December 2016, the department reported that it had identified 10,725 cybersecurity positions, including 6,734 federal civilian positions, 584 military positions, and 3,407 contractor positions. Nevertheless, as of November 2017, the department had not completed identifying all of its cybersecurity positions and it had not determined the work categories or specialty areas of the positions. In explaining why the department had not identified all its positions, OCHCO officials stated that components varied in reporting their identified vacant positions because the department did not have a system to track vacancies. Of the 7 work categories and 33 specialty areas in the NICE framework, DHS reported that its 3 most common work categories were “protect and defend”, “securely provision,” and “oversight and development;” and its 2 most common specialty areas were “security program management” and “vulnerability assessment and management.” However, DHS could not provide data to show the actual numbers of positions in each of these categories and specialty areas. According to OCHCO officials, the department was still in the process of identifying positions for the 2-digit codes and would continue this effort until the 3-digit codes were available in the National Finance Center personnel and payroll system in December 2017. At that time, OCHCO officials stated that the department intends to start developing procedures for identifying and coding positions using the 3-digit codes. The act also required DHS to assign 2-digit employment codes to all of its identified cybersecurity positions. This action was to be completed by September 2015. However, as of August 2017—23 months after the due date—the department had not completed the coding assignment process. Although, in August 2017, OPM provided a progress report to Congress containing DHS data which stated that 95 percent of DHS-identified cybersecurity positions had been coded, our analysis determined that the department had assigned cybersecurity position codes to approximately 79 percent of its identified federal civilian cybersecurity positions. The primary reason for this discrepancy was that DHS did not include the coding of vacant positions, as required by the act. Further, OCHCO officials stated they did not verify the accuracy of the components’ cybersecurity workforce data. Without coding cybersecurity positions in a complete and accurate manner, DHS will not be able to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce; identify skill gaps; and improve workforce planning. Thus, in our recently issued report, we recommended that OCHCO collect complete and accurate data on all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions when it conducts its cybersecurity identification and coding efforts. DHS concurred with the recommendation and stated that, by June 29, 2018, it intends to issue memorandums to its components that provide instructions for the components to periodically review compliance and cybersecurity workforce data concerns to ensure data accuracy. According to the act, DHS was to identify its cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need in alignment with the NICE framework and to report this information to the appropriate congressional committees by June 2016. In addition, a DHS directive required the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer to provide guidance to the department’s components on human resources procedures, including identifying workforce needs. As of February 2018, the department had not fulfilled its requirements to identify and report its critical needs. Although DHS identified workforce skills gaps in a report that it submitted to congressional committees in March 2017, the department did not align the skills gaps to the NICE framework’s defined work categories and specialty areas of critical need. In September 2017, OCHCO developed a draft document that attempted to crosswalk identified department-wide cybersecurity skills gaps to one or more specialty areas in the NICE framework. However, the document did not adequately help components identify their critical needs by aligning their gaps with the NICE framework because it did not provide clear guidance to help components determine a critical need in cases in which a skills gap is mapped to multiple work categories. According to OCHCO officials, DHS had not identified department-wide cybersecurity critical needs that aligned with the framework partly because OPM did not provide DHS with guidance for identifying cybersecurity critical needs. In addition, OCHCO officials stated that the components did not generally view critical skills gaps in terms of the categories or specialty areas as defined in the NICE framework, but instead, described their skills gaps using position titles that are familiar to them. In the absence of relevant guidance to help components identify their critical needs, DHS and the components are hindered from effectively identifying and prioritizing workforce efforts to recruit, hire, train, develop, and retain cybersecurity personnel. DHS also did not report cybersecurity critical needs to OPM in September 2016 or September 2017, as required. Instead, the department first reported its cybersecurity coding progress and skills gaps in a March 2017 report that it sent to OPM and Congress to address several of the act’s requirements. However, the report did not describe or substantiate critical need designations because DHS has not yet identified them. Additionally, DHS had not developed plans or time frames to complete priority actions—developing a DHS cybersecurity workforce strategy and completing its initial cybersecurity workforce research— that OCHCO officials said must be completed before it can report its cybersecurity critical needs to OPM. According to OCHCO officials, the report that the department submitted to Congress in March 2017 had contained plans and schedules. However, we found that the March 2017 report did not capture and sequence all of the activities that DHS officials said must be completed in order to report critical needs. Until DHS develops plans and schedules with time frames for reporting its cybersecurity critical needs, DHS may not have insight into its needs for ensuring that it has the workforce necessary to carry out its critical role of helping to secure the nation’s cyberspace. In our report, we recommended that DHS 1) develop guidance to assist DHS components in identifying their cybersecurity work categories and specialty areas of critical need that align to the NICE framework and 2) develop plans with time frames to identify priority actions to report on specialty areas of critical need. DHS concurred with the recommendations and stated that it plans to implement them by June 2018. In summary, DHS needs to act now to completely and accurately identify, categorize, and assign codes to all of its cybersecurity positions, and to identify and report on its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. Implementing the six recommendations we made in our February 2018 report should better position the department to meet the requirements of the 2014 act. Further, doing so will help DHS understand its needs for recruiting, hiring, developing, and retaining a cybersecurity workforce with the skills necessary to accomplish the department’s varied and essential cybersecurity mission. Until DHS implements our recommendations, it will not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department’s and federal networks and the nation’s critical infrastructure from cyber threats.

The Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 required DHS to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to all of the department's cybersecurity workforce positions. These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs. GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 ). The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions. In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table). Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements. In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed. DHS concurred with the six recommendations and described actions the department plans to take to address them."], "length": 3486, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "278810715acea7581d80c9b5e20ca64bf4efed96d0db0907"}
{"input": "", "context": "The United States Fire Administration (USFA) is currently an entity within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Its mission is to provide leadership, coordination, and support for the nation's fire prevention and control, fire training and education, and emergency medical services activities, and to prepare first responders and health care leaders to react to hazard and terrorism emergencies of all kinds. One of USFA's key objectives is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. Although fire loss has improved significantly over the past 25 years, the fire problem in the United States remains serious. The United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 there were 1,345,500 total fires reported, 3,280 civilian fire deaths, 15,700 civilian fire injuries, and an estimated $14.3 billion in direct property loss. There were 69 on-duty firefighter deaths in 2016. The genesis of USFA and FEMA's fire prevention and control activities can be found in the landmark 1973 report of the National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, entitled America Burning . The commission recommended the creation of a federal fire agency which would provide support to state and local governments and private fire organizations in their efforts to reduce fire deaths, injuries, and property loss. The commission recommended that this new agency be placed within the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Congress instead opted to place the agency in the Department of Commerce, and with the passage of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-498 ), the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (NFPCA) was established. In 1978, Congress changed the name of NFPCA to USFA ( P.L. 95-422 ), and in 1979, President Carter's Reorganization Plan No. 3 placed the USFA within the newly created FEMA. Also in 1979, the National Fire Academy (NFA) in Emmitsburg, MD, was opened, offering courses and training to fire service personnel and other persons engaged in fire prevention and control. During the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration proposed the elimination of the USFA (while preserving the Fire Academy). Although Congress did not allow the termination of the USFA, the agency suffered severe staff reductions and the Fire Academy was separated from the USFA and housed organizationally with other FEMA emergency training programs. In 1991, the NFA was subsequently reorganized back into the USFA, where it remains today. Currently, the USFA is located on the grounds of the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, MD. USFA programs include the following: Data Collection —USFA's National Fire Data Center (NFDC) administers a national system (the National Fire Incident Reporting System or NFIRS) used for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data and information on fire and other emergency incidents to state and local governments and the fire community. The NFDC provides a national analysis of the fire problem, identifying problem areas for which prevention and mitigation strategies are needed. Public Education and Awareness —Through partnerships and special initiatives, USFA involves the fire service, the media, other federal agencies, and safety interest groups in the development and delivery of fire safety awareness and education programs. These programs are targeted at those groups most vulnerable to the hazards of fire, including the young, elderly, and disabled. Training —USFA's National Fire Academy (NFA) offers educational opportunities for the advanced professional development of the mid-level and senior fire/EMS officers and allied professionals involved in fire prevention and life safety activities. The academy develops and delivers educational and training programs with a national focus that supplement and support state and local fire service training. The NFA also offers training to support the National Incident Management System Integration Center (NIC) and nationwide implementation of the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Research and Technology —Through research, testing, and evaluation, USFA works with public and private entities to promote and improve fire and life safety. Research and special studies are conducted on fire detection, suppression, and notification systems, as well as issues related to firefighter and emergency responder health and safety. Research results are published and made available to the public free of charge through the USFA Publications Center. In fulfilling its mission, the USFA uses the assets of the National Fire Academy, the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) Facilities and Support Services, and the National Fire Programs Division. On May 18, 2017, President Trump announced his intention to appoint Chief G. Keith Bryant as the USFA Administrator. G. Keith Bryant was sworn in as the U.S. Fire Administrator on August 4, 2017. The USFA receives its annual appropriation through the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. Table 1 shows recent and proposed appropriated funding for USFA. Beginning in FY2004, the USFA was funded through the Preparedness, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery (PMRR) account within the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security. On July 13, 2005, then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a restructuring of DHS, effective October 1, 2005. USFA was removed from the PMRR account and received a separate appropriation (its own line item) under the new DHS Directorate for Preparedness. The FY2007 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill ( P.L. 109-295 ) transferred the USFA back to the Federal Emergency Management Agency within DHS. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed $42.3 million for USFA, a 3.8% decrease from the FY2016 level. The request included $1.5 million for facilities improvement under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. The budget proposal included $500,000 for distance learning capability and reductions of $1 million each for NFIRS and state fire training grants. The budget request would also transfer the stand-alone USFA budget account into the Preparedness and Protection activity under FEMA's broader Federal Assistance account. On May 26, 2016, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3001 , the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2017. The Senate bill would provide $44 million for USFA, which matches the FY2016 level and is $1.688 million above the request. In the accompanying report ( S.Rept. 114-68 ), the committee stated that the increase over the Administration request should allow for the continued development of NFIRS and support for the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. The committee maintained a separate budget account for USFA and did not transfer the USFA budget account to the Federal Assistance account as proposed in the Administration budget request. On June 22, 2016, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017. Unlike the Senate, the House committee transferred the USFA budget account into a broader \"Federal Assistance\" account in FEMA. The bill provided $42.5 million for USFA under the Federal Assistance account and $1.5 million under Procurement, Construction, and Improvements for National Fire Academy facility costs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 ( P.L. 115-31 ) funded USFA at a total level of $44 million in FY2017. This consisted of $42.5 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. For FY2018, the Administration requested $43.41 million for USFA, slightly below the FY2017 level of $44 million. The FY2018 level consists of $41.913 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.497 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. According to the FY2018 budget proposal, the request reflects a $1 million reduction to the State Fire Training Assistance grants. On July 18, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 ( H.R. 3355 ; H.Rept. 115-239 ). The bill provided the same level as the Administration request: $41.913 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.497 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On September 14, 2017, the House passed H.R. 3354 , a FY2018 omnibus appropriations bill that includes funding for USFA. During floor consideration, the House adopted an amendment offered by Representative Pascrell that added $1 million for USFA's State Fire Training Assistance grants, thereby restoring the Administration's proposed reduction. H.R. 3354 would provide a total of $44.41 million for USFA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ) provided $44.397 million for USFA. This total included $1.497 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. State Fire Training Assistance grants continued to be funded by USFA. For FY2019, the Administration requested $44.993 million for USFA. The FY2019 level consisted of $43.493 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million for annual capital improvement of the National Emergency Training Center under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On June 21, 2018, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 3109 , the Department of Homeland Security Act, 2019 ( S.Rept. 115-283 ). The Senate bill would provide $44 million to USFA in the Federal Assistance account, $507,000 above the budget request, to ensure the National Fire Academy can fulfill its mission of providing training and professional development without reducing its ability to carry out other important responsibilities. The bill report directed FEMA to continue its traditional funding for the congressionally mandated National Fallen Firefighters Memorial. S. 3109 would also provide $1.5 million for annual capital improvement of the National Emergency Training Center under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. On July 25, 2018, the House Appropriations Committee approved its version of the FY2019 Homeland Security bill. Identical to the Administration's budget request, the House bill would provide $43.493 million under Education, Training, and Exercises in the Federal Assistance account, and $1.5 million under the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million for USFA, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-169 ) was signed into law on December 6, 2003. The act reauthorized the USFA through FY2008 at the following levels: $63 million for FY2005, $64.85 million for FY2006, $66.796 million for FY2007, and $68.8 million for FY2008. P.L. 108-169 also reestablished the presidentially appointed position of the U.S. Fire Administrator, which had been statutorily abolished by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Additionally, the legislation directed the USFA to develop new firefighting technologies and standards in coordination with private sector standards groups and federal, state, and local agencies. P.L. 108-169 required that equipment purchased with fire grant money meet or exceed voluntary consensus standards when feasible. The U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 was signed into law on October 8, 2008 ( P.L. 110-376 ). P.L. 110-376 authorized the USFA at $70 million for FY2009, $72.1 million for FY2010, $74.263 million for FY2011, and $76.491 million for FY2012. Provisions included authorizing National Fire Academy training program modifications and reports; directing the National Fire Academy to provide training on incidents occurring in the wildfire-urban interface, multijurisdictional fires, hazardous materials incidents, and advanced emergency medical services; authorizing USFA to enter into contracts with one or more nationally recognized third-party organizations to deliver training; a report on the feasibility of providing incident command training for fires at ports and in marine environments; national fire incident reporting system upgrades; sponsoring and disseminating research on fire prevention and control at the wildland-urban interface; encouraging adoption of national voluntary consensus standards for firefighter health and safety; establishing a state and local fire service position at the National Operations Center within DHS; providing coordination regarding fire prevention and control and emergency medical services; and expressing congressional support for USFA recommendations for adoption and education regarding sprinklers in commercial and residential buildings. On January 2, 2013, the President signed P.L. 112-239 , the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Title XVIII, Subtitle B was the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2012, which authorized USFA through FY2017. P.L. 112-239 included the following provisions: reauthorized USFA at an annual level of $76,490,890 for FY2013 through FY2017, and for each fiscal year sets aside $2,753,672 to be used to carry out Section 8(f) of the Fire Prevention and Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2207) related to evaluation of technology and development of standards; authorized the USFA Administrator to appoint a Deputy Administrator; authorized the Administrator to take such steps as the Administrator considers appropriate to educate the public and overcome public indifference as to fire, fire prevention, and individual preparedness; and removed the limitation on funding levels for updating the National Fire Incident Reporting System. In the 115 th Congress, on July 12, 2017, the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology, Committee on Science, Space and Technology, held a hearing entitled U.S. Fire Administration and Fire Grant Programs Reauthorization: Examining Effectiveness and Priorities . Testimony was heard from the USFA acting administrator and from fire service organizations. On December 15, 2017, H.R. 4661 , the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, was introduced by Representative Comstock, which sought to reauthorize the USFA through FY2023. On December 18, 2017, the House passed H.R. 4661 by voice vote under suspension of the rules. On December 21, 2017, the Senate passed H.R. 4661 without amendment by unanimous consent. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 ( P.L. 115-98 ). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023, of which $2,753,672 each fiscal year is to be used to carry out Section 8(f) of the Fire Prevention and Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2207) related to evaluation of technology and development of standards. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, also known as the FIRE Act grant program, was established by Title XVII of the FY2001 Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 106-398 ). The program provides federal grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated Emergency Medical Services (EMS) organizations to help address a variety of equipment, training, and other firefighter-related and EMS needs. A related program is the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters (SAFER) program, which provides grants for hiring, recruiting, and retaining firefighters. Since its inception, the fire grant program has been administered by FEMA/USFA (FY2001-FY2003), the Office for Domestic Preparedness (FY2004), the Office of State and Local Government Coordination Preparedness (FY2005), and the Office of Grants and Training in the DHS Directorate for Preparedness (FY2006). The FY2007 DHS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-295 ) transferred USFA to FEMA and the fire and SAFER grants to the Grants Programs Directorate in FEMA. Congressional appropriations reports have consistently instructed DHS to maintain USFA involvement in the grant administration process for AFG and SAFER grants. In September 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report entitled Fire Grants: FEMA Could Enhance Program Administration and Performance Assessment. Among its findings, GAO concluded that FEMA has not defined and documented USFA's specific role or responsibilities with the fire grants program, and that there is no formalized relationship or policy regarding how the two organizations' programs could work together. According to GAO Although a level of informal coordination exists between GPD [Grant Programs Directorate] and USFA, enhancing these efforts by using collaborative mechanisms that our work across the federal government has identified as key features and issues to consider during implementation—such as clearly defining and agreeing upon USFA's role and responsibilities and documenting agreement regarding how they will be collaborating—could help GPD further leverage USFA expertise and resources in support of the fire grants programs, which could also help GPD manage the integration of fire grants into broader national preparedness efforts. In December 2016, the USFA signed an agreement with FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate to provide a framework for each entity's roles and responsibilities for improving the management of the fire grants. Concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level, and given that USFA's budget has remained flat over recent years. The 116 th Congress may also consider whether the role of USFA might be expanded. For example, H.R. 1646 , the Helping Emergency Responders Overcome Act of 2019 (the HERO Act), introduced by Representative Bera on March 8, 2019, would direct USFA, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to develop and make publicly available resources that may be used by the federal government and other entities to educate mental health professionals about the mental health issues and challenges faced by firefighters and emergency medical services personnel. Finally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security. While supportive of the reorganization of FEMA into DHS, many in the fire service community have cautioned that USFA and NFA programs—which address the day-to-day challenges faced by fire departments—should not be overshadowed in an organization which focuses on homeland security and counterterrorism. Since the establishment of DHS in March 2003, fire service groups have opposed a number of actions DHS has taken with respect to the USFA and NFA. These included the abolishment of the presidentially appointed position of U.S. Fire Administrator (subsequently reestablished by enactment of the USFA Reauthorization Act of 2003); proposed cancellations of some NFA courses in 2003 due to an across-the-board FEMA budget cut (those NFA courses were subsequently restored after fire service protests); and the transfer of the fire grant program from the USFA to the DHS Office for Domestic Preparedness. ", "answers": ["The United States Fire Administration (USFA)—which includes the National Fire Academy (NFA)—is currently housed within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance. On January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98).

{"input": "", "context": "T he Agriculture appropriations bill—formally called the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act—funds all of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), excluding the U.S. Forest Service. Congress passed the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act on March 23, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ). FY2019 began with seven appropriations bills, including USDA, unfinished. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reported Agriculture appropriations bills for FY2019 ( H.R. 5961 , S. 2976 ), with the Senate having amended and passed its version as Division C of a four-bill minibus ( H.R. 6147 ). Congress and the President approved continuing resolutions to fund the affected federal agencies through December 21, 2018, at the FY2018 level ( P.L. 115-245 and P.L. 115-298 ). After December 21, 2018, a partial shutdown of the government, including many agencies within USDA, occurred. One of the few exceptions was the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which was able to operate on mandatory and carryover funds during the majority of the shutdown. On January 25, 2019, an agreement was reached to continue funding for USDA and other appropriations that had lapsed through February 15, at the FY2018 level ( P.L. 116-5 ). The FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on February 15, 2019, funding USDA through the end of the fiscal year (Division B, P.L. 116-6 ). This report provides a brief overview of the conservation-related provisions in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts. For a general analysis of the FY2018 appropriations for agriculture, see CRS Report R45128, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2018 Appropriations , and for FY2019, see CRS Report R45230, Agriculture and Related Agencies: FY2019 Appropriations . USDA administers a number of agricultural conservation programs that assist private landowners with natural resource concerns. These include working land programs, land retirement and easement programs, watershed programs, technical assistance, and other programs. The two lead agricultural conservation agencies within USDA are the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical assistance and administers most conservation programs, and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), which administers the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Most conservation program funding is mandatory, obtained through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) and authorized in omnibus farm bills (about $5.3 billion of CCC funds for conservation in FY2018). Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary spending and are funded through annual appropriations (about $1 billion annually). For the first time since FY2002, the FY2018 Agriculture appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. It did, however, include legislative changes that affect farm bill programs and watershed programs. Similarly, the FY2019 appropriations act did not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs; however, the enacted 2018 farm bill (Agriculture Improvement Act, P.L. 115-334 ) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. The FY2018 appropriations act included a slight increase from FY2017 levels for discretionary conservation programs. The FY2019 appropriations act included a decrease from FY2018 levels for discretionary conservation programs and redirected funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center (see Table 1 and Figure 1 ). NRCS administers all discretionary conservation programs. The largest program and the account that funds most NRCS activities is Conservation Operations (CO). The CO account primarily funds Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA), which provides conservation planning and implementation assistance through field staff placed in almost all counties within the United States and territories. Other components of CO include the Soil Surveys, Snow Survey and Water Supply Forecasting, and Plant Materials Centers. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million—more than the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request ($699 million) was less than the amount later enacted for FY2019 due to a proposed consolidation of mandatory and discretionary accounts to pay for conservation technical assistance. The proposal to consolidate funding has been made by USDA through multiple Administrations but never adopted by Congress (see text box below). The FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations acts direct CO funding for a number of conservation programs ( Table 1 ). Report language further directs funding to selected activities ( Table 3 ). The enacted FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations also contain funding for watershed activities, including $150 million annually for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—a program that assists state and local organizations with planning and installing measures to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. This is the same level as appropriated in FY2017, which was the first appropriated funding for the WFPO program since FY2010. Beginning in FY2006, Administrations began requesting no funding for WFPO, citing program inflexibility and a backlog of congressionally earmarked projects. The Trump Administration's FY2018 and FY2019 requests proposed no funding for the program. Since FY2014, Congress has directed a portion of CO funds to select WFPO activities. Similar directive language ($5.6 million; see Table 1 ) is in the FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations, in addition to the $150 million made available each fiscal year for the program as a whole. The enacted FY2018 and FY2019 appropriations include $10 million annually for the Watershed Rehabilitation program––a reduction from the FY2017 level of $12 million. The Watershed Rehabilitation program repairs aging dams previously built by USDA under WFPO. The Administration proposed no funding in FY2018 and FY2019. The 2018 farm bill made minor amendments to WFPO, the most substantial being the authorization of permanent mandatory funding of $50 million annually. The new mandatory funding will be in addition to discretionary funding provided through annual appropriations and could be used for either WFPO or Watershed Rehabilitation activities. Mandatory conservation programs are generally authorized in omnibus farm bills and receive funding from the CCC and thus do not require an annual appropriation. In the past, Congress has used annual agriculture appropriations acts to reduce mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) every year from FY2003 to FY2017. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act marked the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to conservation programs. This allowed all mandatory conservation programs to utilize their full authorized level of funding in FY2018, minus sequestration. Additionally, prior-year CHIMPS concerning programs that are authorized to remain available until expended (e.g., Watershed Rehabilitation) became available for obligation in FY2018. Nearly all mandatory conservation programs authorized in the 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014; P.L. 113-79 ) expired on September 30, 2018. One exception is the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), whose authority was extended to FY2019 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123 ). The 2018 farm bill reauthorized mandatory funding for all conservation programs, including for FY2019. Similar to FY2018, the FY2019 appropriations bill, which was enacted after enactment of the 2018 farm bill, does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs. On May 11, 2017, USDA announced the creation of the Farm Production and Conservation (FPAC) mission area as part of a larger Departmental reorganization. FPAC includes NRCS, FSA, Risk Management Agency (RMA), and a new FPAC Business Center. The FPAC Business Center is responsible for financial management, budgeting, human resources, information technology, acquisitions/procurement, strategic planning, and other customer-oriented operations of the three domestic agriculture agencies (NRCS, FSA, and RMA). The FY2018 Administration budget request was released two weeks following the announcement for FPAC (May 23, 2017), but did not include funding for the FPAC Business Center. The FY2019 Administration budget request did include funding for the Business Center ($196.4 million), as well as a request to transfer funding from other accounts ($76.3 million) to the Business Center. Final enactment of the FY2018 appropriation occurred on March 23, 2018, after the release of the Administration's FY2019 budget request, which occurred on February 12, 2018. The FY2018 appropriation included about $1 million for the Business Center. The FY2018 explanatory statement required USDA to submit an implementation and spending plan to Congress for the new FPAC mission area that would detail requested transfers. USDA submitted the FPAC spending plan on August 28, 2018. The FY2019 appropriation had already been marked up in the House and Senate, and did not include the full level of requested funding for the Business Center. The enacted FY2019 appropriations (February 15, 2019), however, did increase funding for the Business Center. The enacted level is more than the Administration's request and directs a transfer of funds from other accounts into the Business Center, including mandatory conservation programs and farm loan accounts. Funding for NRCS and FSA is reduced accordingly and FPAC Business Center funding shifts are dictated in the FY2019 explanatory statement (see Table 2 ). It is unclear what level of savings is projected from the centralization of agency functions and what this savings will ultimately be redirected toward. Overall, the total changes in funding for the new Business Center do not necessarily reflect a decline in NRCS resources. Total CO (discretionary spending) was reduced between FY2018 and FY2019 by $54.6 million, whereas NRCS' contribution to the FPAC Business Center appropriation for FY2019 is $70.8 million, thus indicating an effective increase of $16.2 million to NRCS in FY2019. This could result in NRCS effectively receiving less in total funding depending whether the amount shifted would have been used for administrative or technical assistance purposes had the Business Center not been in existence. The mandatory conservation program funding ($60.2 million) that is authorized to be transferred to the FPAC Business Center comes from programs authorized to receive CCC funding under 16 U.S.C. 3841(a). Three programs within the conservation title of the 2018 farm bill are included in this transfer—EQIP, CSP, and the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). Other mandatory conservation programs funded through the cited CCC authority (16 U.S.C. 3841(a)) are not included in the transfer, including CRP, which is administered by FSA. The transfer in the FY2019 appropriations act redirects mandatory funding that was authorized in the farm bill. It is unclear what, if any, effect the transfer could have on the implementation of EQIP, CSP, and ACEP, and the financial assistance offered by those programs. In FY2019, a 34-day funding gap lasted from December 22, 2018, through January 25, 2019. It affected agencies funded by 7 of the 12 appropriations bills, including Agriculture appropriations. In general, a shutdown results in the furlough of many personnel and curtailment of affected agency activities and services. Exceptions may allow certain activities to continue, such as for law enforcement, protection of human life or property, and activities funded by other means such as carryover funds or user fees. Agencies make their own determinations about activities and personnel that are \"excepted\" from furlough and publish their intentions in \"contingency plans\" that are supervised by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). USDA published contingency plans for each agency, including NRCS. USDA initially estimated on December 23, 2018, that 61% of its employees were excepted from furlough in the agencies that are funded by Agriculture appropriations (all of USDA except the Forest Service), which amounts to 37,860 staff being excepted out of 62,288. The number of excepted and furloughed personnel varied by agency. As previously discussed, NRCS funds technical assistance and related agency staff through both mandatory and discretionary accounts. As such, NRCS was initially able to claim as excepted 100% of its 9,342 staff using mandatory conservation program funding authorized through the farm bill (and therefore not affected by the lapse in discretionary appropriations), and discretionary carryover funding from prior fiscal years. As the shutdown continued, however, NRCS announced its intention to furlough some employees beginning on February 3, 2019, to conserve carryover balances and focus excepted staff on mandatory farm bill conservation program implementation. This plan was not implemented because the shutdown ended on January 25, 2019. Generally, Congress employs two separate types of legislative measures—authorizations and appropriations. Authorization acts establish, continue, or modify agencies or programs. Appropriations acts generally provide discretionary funding for authorized agencies and programs. While this practice is infrequent and subject to various procedural rules and limitations, the Agriculture appropriations bill may serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs. These amendments generally have the force of law by amending the U.S. Code or by creating a permanent authorization. This is different from policy-related provisions (discussed in the \" Policy-Related Provisions \" section), which generally direct how the executive branch should carry out the appropriations and whose effect is typically limited to the current fiscal year. In some cases, the 2018 farm bill further amended the conservation programs that were amended in the FY2018 appropriations act. Where relevant, these amendments are noted; however, the focus is on amendments made in appropriations acts. The FY2018 agriculture appropriations act included statutory amendments to the WFPO program. Section 761 of P.L. 115-141 amended the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act of 1954 (16 U.S.C. 1001 et seq. ) by increasing the size thresholds required for congressional approval under the program. Under the amended language, approval by the Senate and House Agriculture Committees is required for individual projects that need an estimated federal contribution of more than $25 million for construction, an increase from the previous $5 million threshold. This amendment originated in the FY2018 Senate-reported bill ( S. 1603 , §754). The FY2018 appropriation also amended Title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 ( P.L. 99-198 ; often referred to as the \"1985 farm bill\") by adding a new section that exempts farm bill conservation programs from certain reporting requirements. Federal grant recipients must comply with government-wide financial management policies and reporting requirements when receiving federal grants and agreements. Many of these reporting requirements are not new for USDA programs and have been in place for a number of years. Interested stakeholders raised concerns when a number of the farm bill conservation programs were designated as grants (rather than direct payments) under a 2010 regulation. This designation triggered the use of a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number and System for Award Management (SAM) registration. The DUNS number requirement and SAM registration did not affect individuals or entities that apply for conservation programs using a Social Security number. Rather, it applied only to those applying as an entity with a Taxpayer Identification Number or Employee Identification Number. The amendment exempts producers and landowners who participate in farm bill conservation programs from the DUNS number and SAM registration requirement. The amendment originated in the FY2018 Senate-reported bill ( S. 1603 , §740). The 2018 farm bill moved and expanded this exemption to include conservation, indemnity or disease control, or commodity programs administered by NRCS, FSA, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. In addition to setting budgetary amounts, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also include policy-related provisions that direct how the executive branch should carry out an appropriation. These provisions may have the force of law if they are included in the text of an appropriations act, but their effect is generally limited to the current fiscal year (see Table 3 ). Unlike the aforementioned authorization amendments that may be included in appropriations acts, policy-related provisions generally do not amend the U.S. Code or have long-standing effects. For example, the WFPO program has historically been called the \"small watershed program,\" because no project may exceed 250,000 acres, and no structure may exceed more than 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater detention capacity or 25,000 acre-feet of total capacity. The FY2018 and FY2019 enacted appropriations also include a policy provision that waives the 250,000-acre project limit when the project's primary purpose is something other than flood prevention. This provision does not amend the WFPO authorization and therefore is effective only for the funds provided during the appropriation year. Table 3 compares some of the policy provisions that have been identified in the Farm Production and Conservation Programs (Title II) and General Provisions (Title VII) titles of the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations bills related to conservation. Many of these provisions were also included in past years' appropriations laws. The explanatory statement that accompanies the final appropriation—and the House and Senate report language that accompanies the committee-reported bills—may also provide policy instructions. These documents do not have the force of law but often explain congressional intent, which the agencies are expected to follow (see Table 4 ). The committee reports and explanatory statement may need to be read together to capture all of the congressional intent for a given fiscal year. Table 4 compares some of the policy provisions that have been identified in the FY2018 and FY2019 Agriculture appropriations reported language related to conservation. The FY2018 enacted report language column includes references to the House (H) and Senate (S) report language, as well as the enacted (E) explanatory statement. The FY2019 enacted report language column includes references to the House (H) and Senate (S) report language, and the enacted (E) conference report. The inclusion of all three reports better captures congressional intent for each fiscal year. Many of these provisions have been included in past years' appropriations laws. Some provisions in report language and bill text address conservation programs not authorized or funded within the annual appropriation (i.e., mandatory spending for farm-bill-authorized programs). ", "answers": ["The Agriculture appropriations bill funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) except for the Forest Service. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 115-141, Division A), and the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-6, Division B) include funding for conservation programs and activities at USDA.

Agricultural conservation programs include both mandatory and discretionary spending. Most conservation program funding is mandatory and is authorized in omnibus farm bills. Other conservation programs—mostly technical assistance—are discretionary and are funded through annual appropriations. The largest discretionary program is the Conservation Operations (CO) account, which funds conservation planning and implementation assistance on private agricultural lands across the country. The enacted FY2018 appropriation provided $874 million for CO, an increase from the FY2017 enacted amount ($864 million). The enacted FY2019 appropriation decreases funding for CO below FY2018 levels to $819 million and redirects funding to the new Farm Production and Conservation Business Center. Other discretionary spending is primarily for watershed programs. The largest—Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations (WFPO)—was funded at $150 million annually in FY2018 and FY2019. Most mandatory conservation programs are authorized in omnibus farm bills and do not require an annual appropriation. However, Congress has reduced mandatory conservation programs through changes in mandatory program spending (CHIMPS) in the annual agricultural appropriations law every year since FY2003. The enacted FY2018 omnibus marks the first appropriation since FY2002 that did not include CHIMPS to mandatory conservation programs. The enacted FY2019 appropriation also does not include reductions to mandatory conservation programs, as most programs' authorizations expired on September 30, 2018, making these programs ineligible for reduction. The 2018 farm bill (Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334) reauthorized and amended funding for many of the mandatory conservation programs. While this is infrequent, the Agriculture appropriations bill may also serve as a vehicle for amendments to authorized programs that permanently alter or create programs.

{"input": "", "context": "T he Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) authorizes the Department of Labor (DOL) to make grants to support part-time community service employment opportunities for eligible individuals who are age 55 or over and have limited employment prospects. Participation in the program is temporary, with the goal of transitioning participants to unsubsidized employment. In FY2019, appropriations for the SCSEP program were $400 million and supported approximately 41,000 positions. SCSEP appropriations accounted for approximately 20% of total Older Americans Act funding in FY2019. SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended (OAA; 42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.) Since enactment of the OAA, Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times. Most recently, the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, and made other changes to the act. Prior to the 2016 OAA reauthorization, the OAA Amendments of 2006 ( P.L. 109-365 ) reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. Although the authorizations of appropriations under the OAA expired at the end of FY2011, Congress continued to appropriate funding for OAA-authorized activities through FY2016. Grants under the program are administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) at the Department of Labor (DOL). (References to the Secretary in this report refer to the Secretary of Labor, unless otherwise specified.) SCSEP is the only OAA program administered by DOL. Other OAA programs are administered by the Administration for Community Living (ACL) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). SCSEP is supported by discretionary appropriations under the DOL-HHS appropriations bill. SCSEP programs operate on DOL's program year (PY), which operates nine months behind the fiscal year. Activities in a given program year are supported by funding from the corresponding fiscal year. For example, PY2017 ran from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, and was supported by FY2017 appropriations. Programs administered under Title V of the OAA may also be referred to as the Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) programs. DOL uses the CSEOA and SCSEP terminology interchangeably. From its total appropriation, the OAA establishes three reservations: (1) up to 1.5% for DOL-selected pilots, demonstration, and evaluation projects; (2) a fixed percentage of 0.75% for the territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands; and (3) a portion determined by the Secretary for activities that support eligible individuals who are American Indian and Pacific Islander/Asian American. The remaining funds are allocated to formula grants. Title V supports formula grants to both national organizations (\"national grantees\") and state agencies (\"state grantees\"). National grantees are typically nonprofit organizations that operate in more than one state. State grantees are state government agencies. State grantee agencies are typically housed in a state's workforce unit or aging unit. In PY2018, approximately 78% of funds for formula grants ($298 million) were distributed among national grantees. There are about 15-20 national grantee organizations, including AARP and the National Council on Aging. About 22% of PY2018 funds for grants ($84 million) were allocated to state agencies. Both national grantees and state grantees subgrant funds to partner organizations that work with host agencies that provide the actual employment (see Figure 1 ). The OAA specifies that in years where funds available for formula grants exceed the \"funds necessary to maintain the fiscal year 2000 level of activities supported by grantees,\" the excess funds are allotted using a series of formulas that are directly correlated to the number of persons age 55 and over in the state and inversely correlated to the per capita income of the state. Thus, the formulas favor states with larger populations of persons age 55 or over and states with lower per capita incomes. The law contains hold harmless provisions that specify that in years where funds are less than their FY2000 level, funds are awarded proportionately \"to maintain their fiscal year 2000 level of activities.\" The last year in which funds were allocated using the formula was PY2010. Since then, funding for grants has consistently been below the FY2000 level (see Table 1 ). As such, specific grant levels have varied but each state's relative share of grants funds has been proportionate to its FY2000 levels and a consistent share of the funding has been allocated to national grantees in each state as well as each state agency. The OAA defines a state's allotment (and corresponding hold harmless share of funding) as the sum of the allotment for national grants in the state and the grant to the state agency. The proportion of each state's total funding that comes from grants to national organizations versus grants to the state agency varies somewhat. As a condition of receiving SCSEP funds, each state's governor must develop and submit a state plan to DOL. The plan can be an independent document or part of a combined plan with the state's activities under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the primary federal workforce development legislation authorizing workforce services for the broader population. Whether the SCSEP plan is independent or part of a combined plan, it must provide information on individuals in the state who will be eligible for the program as well as the localities most in need of services. The plan must be developed in consultation with the state WIOA agency, national grantees operating in the state, and other stakeholders. The state plan must describe how the activities under SCSEP will be coordinated with activities under WIOA and how the state will minimize duplication between Title V and WIOA. Grantees that receive funds directly from DOL typically allocate funds to subgrantees and/or host agencies that provide the actual work site placements and part-time community service employment. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting program participants. To be eligible for the program, a prospective participant must be age 55 or older, unemployed, and a member of a family with income of not more than 125% of the poverty level ($15,613 for a family size of one in 2019). Statute specifies that priority will be given to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment. Specifically, an individual may receive priority if the individual is 65 years of age or older; has a disability; has limited English proficiency or low literacy skills; resides in a rural area; is a veteran; has low employment prospects; has failed to find employment after utilizing services provided under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act; or is homeless or at risk for homelessness. As is the case with other DOL programs, eligible veterans receive priority of service in the SCSEP program. The OAA allows host agencies to employ program participants part-time in a variety of community service activities, including (but not limited to) social, health, welfare, and educational services as well as conservation and community beautification activities. Some participants may be employed at senior centers and other facets of the Aging Network established by the OAA, such as an Area Agency on Aging. Program participants are paid by the host agency. Participants must earn the highest of (1) the federal minimum wage, (2) the prevailing minimum wage in the state or locality in which the participant works, or (3) the prevailing rate for individuals employed in similar occupations by the same employer. Title V of the OAA does not establish a definition for \"part-time\" and federal policy does not limit the number of hours participants can work. In establishing the cost per authorized position, however, Title V establishes a formula that includes the federal minimum wage \"multiplied by the number of hours equal to the product of 21 hours and 52 weeks.\" As part of program orientation, the subgrantee or host agency is responsible for assessing the participant, including the participant's skills, interests, needs, and potential for unsubsidized employment. Using information from this assessment, the grantee works with the participant to develop an individual employment plan (IEP) that includes a post-service objective (including employment, if appropriate) and the timeline for achievement of that objective. In addition to employment, grantee organizations may also provide training and supportive services. These services can include (but are not limited to) costs of transportation, health and medical services, special job-related or personal counseling, and work-related incidentals such as eyeglasses or work shoes. Individual participants are typically limited to an aggregate maximum of 48 months of participation in the program. Grantees are required to manage programs such that the average duration of participation for all participants does not exceed 27 months. This cap may be increased to an average of 36 months in certain circumstances such as high unemployment in the service area. SCSEP participants are not federal employees. Regulations specify that grantees are responsible for determining whether or not a participant qualifies as an employee of the grantee, subgrantee, or host agency under applicable laws. Grantees must match SCSEP grants such that federal funds account for no more than 90% of the project cost. DOL may waive match requirements in cases of emergency or disaster projects or projects in economically depressed areas. At least 75% of federal grants must be used to pay wages and legally required benefits for program participants. In limited cases, this requirement may be reduced to 65% if the program allocates a certain portion of funds to training and supportive services. In most circumstances, grantees may not use more than 13.5% of their federal grant for administrative expenses. Federal law establishes six core indicators for CSEOA grantees. Three of the six CSEOA indicators focus on unsubsidized employment and earnings after participation in the program. The performance indicators are 1. hours (in the aggregate) of community service employment; 2. the percentage of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the project; 3. the percentage of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the fourth quarter after exit from the project; 4. the median earnings of project participants who are in unsubsidized employment during the second quarter after exit from the project; 5. indicators of effectiveness in serving employers, host agencies, and project participants; and 6. the number of eligible individuals served, including the number of participating individuals with demonstrated barriers to employment. Indicators 2-4 are largely based on the performance accountability indicators for the general workforce programs under WIOA. Indicators 1, 5, and 6 do not have direct analogues in the WIOA performance accountability system. The current performance accountability measures were established by the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-144 ). Grantees started reporting performance under these metrics beginning in PY2018, starting July 1, 2018. Grantees negotiate expected performance levels with DOL. Negotiating performance levels at the grantee level allows the expected performance levels to reflect the types of participants a particular grantee serves or the environment in which it operates (e.g., the grantee serves a disproportionate number of high-need participants or operates in an area with a high rate of unemployment.) Performance accountability is assessed at the level of the grantee (i.e., the entity that receives funding directly from DOL). Grantees are responsible for oversight of subgrantees and host agencies. Regulations establish that performance is measured as a percentage of the negotiated level of performance. For example, if a grantee negotiates a performance rate of 50% of participants in unsubsidized employment in the second quarter after exit and 48% of the program participants subsequently meet that standard, the grantee has reached 96% of its agreed-upon level of performance. Performance in the range of 80% to 100% constitutes meeting the core level of performance. If a national or state grantee fails to meets its negotiated level of performance, the grantee must receive technical assistance from DOL and submit a corrective action plan. If a national grantee fails to meet expected levels of performance for four consecutive years, the grantee may not compete in the subsequent grant competition. If a state grantee fails to meet the expected levels of performance for three consecutive program years, the state must conduct a competition to award its formula funds to a new grantee. DOL makes available several reports with SCSEP participation data. Data are reported by program year. Reports currently made available by DOL include the following: Aggregate and Individual Performance Reports . These reports include the performance of each national grantee and state agency relative to the negotiated levels of performance. Nationwide Quarterly Progress . These reports include total participation as well as data on demographics and participants' demonstrated barriers to employment. Service to Minority Individuals . These reports include information on the participation and outcomes of minorities for each grantee. The reports are required under Section 515 of the OAA. ", "answers": ["The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) authorizes the Department of Labor (DOL) to make grants to support part-time community service employment opportunities for eligible individuals age 55 or over. In FY2019, appropriations for SCSEP programs were $400 million and supported approximately 41,000 positions. DOL may also refer to the SCSEP program as Community Service Employment for Older Americans (CSEOA) SCSEP is authorized by Title V of the Older Americans Act (OAA). The Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) authorized appropriations for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019. In FY2019, SCSEP appropriations accounted for about 20% of the funding under the OAA. The bulk of SCSEP appropriations support two primary grant streams: one to national nonprofit organizations and one to state agencies. In the most recent program year, approximately 78% of formula grant funds were allocated to national grantees and about 22% were allocated to state grantees. Both the national organizations and state grantees subgrant funds to host agencies that provide the actual community service employment opportunities to participants. Host agencies are responsible for recruiting eligible participants. To be eligible for the program, prospective participants must be at least age 55, low-income, and unemployed. Federal law requires host agencies to give preference to prospective participants who demonstrate additional barriers to employment such as having a disability or being at risk of homelessness. Program participants work part-time in community service jobs, including employment at schools, libraries, social service organizations, or senior-serving organizations. Program participants earn the higher of minimum wage or the typical wage for the job in which they are employed. An individual may typically participate in the program for a cumulative total of no more than 48 months. During orientation, participants receive an assessment of their skills, interests, capabilities, and needs. This assessment informs the development of an individual employment plan (IEP). A participant's IEP is updated throughout their participation in the program. Grantees are subject to a performance accountability system. Performance metrics generally relate to participants' unsubsidized employment and earnings after exiting the program. In addition to outcome-based metrics, grantees are also assessed on participants' total number of hours of service and whether the grantee served participants with barriers to employment.

{"input": "", "context": "We found in our March 2018 report that, from September 2012 through September 2017, parties accused of patent infringement filed 524 petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board challenging the validity of 359 distinct patents under the CBM program, resulting in rulings against about one-third of these patents. The average monthly number of CBM petitions fluctuated during this period and tapered off over time (see fig. 1). Specifically, during this 5-year period, an average of more than 9 petitions per month were filed under the CBM program, but this average rate declined to fewer than 5 per month in the last fiscal year, with no petitions filed in August or September 2017. Stakeholders we interviewed suggested several possible reasons for the decline in CBM petitions, including recent decisions from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court that clarified which patents are eligible for CBM review; that CBM petitioners successfully targeted the lowest-quality business method patents— patents that should not have been issued because they did not meet the patentability requirements—in the early years of the program, and now those patents have been eliminated; and that owners of business method patents are more wary of asserting their intellectual property through infringement lawsuits and risking its invalidation. Some stakeholders expressed concern about multiple petitions being filed against the same patent. Specifically, stakeholders have suggested that petitioners are, in some cases, using the CBM program and the inter partes review program as tools to increase costs borne by patent owners, and in the case of the CBM program, as a tool to delay district court proceedings. In addition, some stakeholders asserted that this manner of use of the administrative proceedings authorized by the AIA amounts to harassment. However, our analysis of petition data showed that the vast majority of patents challenged under the CBM program were challenged once or twice. Stakeholders we interviewed outlined several reasons why petitioners may file more than one petition against a single patent. For example, the board limits the number of pages that a petitioner may use to submit prior art and arguments for invalidity and therefore some petitioners might file more than one petition so they can present all of their art and arguments at once. Overall, through September 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board had completed reviews of 329 of the 359 patents challenged under the program, and for about one-third of these patents the board ruled at least some challenged patent claims unpatentable. Data on petition outcomes are open to different interpretations depending on how they are presented. For example, under the CBM program, board judges ruled some or all of the patent claims considered at trial unpatentable in 96.7 percent of the petitions for which they issued a final written decision from September 2012 through September 2017. On the basis of this statistic, the board could seem to invalidate the majority of the patents it reviews, as noted by some stakeholders. However, this outcome is predictable given the criteria for accepting, or instituting, a CBM trial—a judge panel will institute a petition to the trial phase if it is “more likely than not” that at least one of the claims challenged in a petition is unpatentable—which tips outcomes for instituted petitions toward rulings of unpatentability. In addition, board judges do not issue final written decisions for all petitions that enter the trial phase because the parties often reach a settlement before the final written decision. When taking into account all of the CBM petitions that had an outcome as of September 30, 2017, board judges ruled some or all of the claims considered at trial unpatentable in 35.6 percent of the cases. We found in our March 2018 report that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board has completed all trials under AIA-authorized proceedings within statutorily directed time frames, according to board data, and the board has taken steps to review issues that could affect the consistency of its trial proceedings and decisions and to engage with stakeholders to improve its proceedings. Board officials we interviewed told us the timeliness of decisions to institute a trial and of final written decisions has not been a concern in the 5 years that the board has operated. According to board officials, as of November 2017, two AIA trials—one under the inter partes review program and one under the CBM program—have been extended, for good cause, past the typical 1-year time limit between the institution decision and the final written decision, as allowed by statute. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has decision review processes that help ensure trial decisions are reviewed as appropriate, but the board cannot ensure the consistency of its trial decisions because it does not have guidance for reviewing the decisions or the processes that lead to them. For trials still in progress, board officials told us there are several ways management gets involved in reviews—including reviews of ongoing trials if and when a paneled judge raises any issue deserving of management attention. Such issues are brought to the attention of the chief judge or other members of the board’s management team and are acted upon at their discretion. Board officials also told us that a separate internal review process has evolved over time, whereby a small group of board judges, in consultation with board management, seeks to ensure decision quality and consistency by reading a large number of draft AIA trial decisions and giving feedback or suggestions to authoring judges prior to issuance. In addition, the board reviews any AIA trial decisions that are appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the appeals court subsequently reverses or remands. Finally, board officials told us that the board has begun to increase the number of trial decisions considered for precedential and informative designations as part of its efforts to ensure the consistency of trial decisions. Taken together, the board’s review processes help ensure that board trial decisions are reviewed in some manner. However, because the board does not have documented procedures for how to review decisions for consistency, the board cannot fully ensure the consistency of the decisions or the processes that lead to them. Under federal standards for internal control, management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks. Such control activities include clearly documenting internal control in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. The documentation may appear in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals. We recommended that the Director of USPTO develop guidance, such as documented procedures, for judges reviewing the Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decisions and the processes that lead to the decisions. USPTO agreed with our recommendation and stated that it has begun taking actions to address it. In addition, to improve various aspects of its trial proceedings, the board has taken several steps to engage with stakeholders. USPTO’s strategic plan states that the board should expand outreach to stakeholders by providing opportunities for interaction and updates on board operations and other important issues. The board has done so through several types of public outreach efforts, including participating in roundtables, webinars, and judicial conferences, among other activities. The board has made several changes to policies and procedures based on stakeholder feedback gathered through these mechanisms. Stakeholders we interviewed for our March 2018 report generally agreed the CBM program has reduced litigation involving business method patents because the CBM program allows these patents to be more easily challenged than in district courts, and many stakeholders said there is value in maintaining some aspects of the program. Stakeholders told us that fewer business method patent lawsuits are filed and that existing lawsuits are often dropped after patents have been through the CBM program. However, stakeholders also noted that the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l has contributed to the reduced number of business method patent lawsuits. Stakeholders told us that the CBM program has made it riskier to assert business method patents because, compared with district court, the program offers a cheaper and more efficient way for alleged infringers to challenge a patent’s validity. In addition, according to stakeholders, patent owners are more focused on asserting business method patents that are higher quality and less vulnerable to challenge either under the CBM program or based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Alice; these are patents that describe a technological invention that is not abstract and implemented on a generic computer. Stakeholders we interviewed generally agreed the effects of the CBM program on innovation and investment have been minimal or mostly positive. More specifically, stakeholders told us that the CBM program is good for overall innovation and investment in financial technologies in that the program eliminates overly broad (non-specific), low-quality patents. Stakeholders told us they believe the existence and assertion of overly broad patents is bad for innovation, in part because defending against alleged infringement is expensive and time-consuming, even under the CBM program. Assertion of overly broad, unclear, or otherwise low-quality patents acts much like a tax on investment, according to stakeholders. Stakeholders also told us that removing such patents from the marketplace promotes innovation because it prevents these patents from blocking new innovation. According to stakeholders, innovation is represented by the quality of the patents issued rather than the quantity. A large number of patents in a technology space, according to stakeholders, can make it difficult to innovate within that crowded space. Most stakeholders told us there was value in maintaining aspects of the CBM program, including the ability to challenge patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board on all four patentability requirements—subject matter; novelty; non-obviousness; and clarity and specificity. Stakeholders we interviewed pointed to inconsistencies in how federal courts interpret subject matter eligibility and clarity requirements, in particular. Stakeholders said that the federal courts and jurors do not necessarily have the expertise to interpret requirements for subject matter eligibility and clarity, and that the technically trained Patent Trial and Appeal Board judges were better suited to make patentability determinations on these grounds. Stakeholders generally agreed that the ability to challenge a patent’s validity on subject matter eligibility grounds remains important, although there was not broad agreement among stakeholders regarding how far that ability should extend beyond business method patents. Some stakeholders said subject matter eligibility challenges were important for a wider scope of patents than just business methods because concerns about subject matter eligibility that apply to business method patents extend to software-related patents in general. Similarly, stakeholders told us that patent clarity problems exist beyond business method patents.

The CBM program provides entities facing infringement lawsuits an opportunity to challenge the validity of a business method patent by demonstrating that it did not meet requirements for patentability. Business method patents focus on ways of doing business in areas such as banking or e-commerce. The rate of filing petitions over this period has fluctuated but has generally declined since 2015, and none were filed in August or September 2017. USPTO has taken several steps to ensure the timeliness of trial decisions, review past decisions, and engage with stakeholders to improve proceedings under the program: Timeliness: USPTO regularly informs relevant parties about paperwork requirements and due dates throughout trials.

{"input": "", "context": "Countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) remains a U.S. national security priority. According to the 2017 National Security Strategy, terrorist groups continue to pursue WMD-related materials, which pose a grave danger to the United States. As also stated in the 2017 National Security Strategy, Russia’s nuclear arsenal remains the most existential threat to the United States, China’s nuclear arsenal is growing and diversifying, Iran has the potential of renewing its nuclear program and North Korea has pursued nuclear weapons despite international commitments. As the DSB report noted, U.S. monitoring abilities are increasingly challenged by evolving risks in 1) the capability of existing nuclear states and 2) the number of state and nonstate actors possessing or attempting to possess nuclear weapons. U.S. nonproliferation activities are conducted and coordinated across multiple government agencies and organizations, as well as the intelligence community. In addition, these efforts are coordinated with international entities, national laboratories, industry, and academia. U.S. nuclear nonproliferation verification and monitoring efforts are guided by, among other things, U.S. obligations under the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and U.S. support for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO). The NPT lays out the respective responsibilities of nuclear-weapon and nonnuclear-weapon states with regard to the transfer, acquisition, possession, control, and manufacture of nuclear weapons. All nonnuclear-weapon states are required to have a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to facilitate IAEA’s safeguards activities. IAEA safeguards are a set of technical measures and activities by which IAEA seeks to verify that nuclear material subject to safeguards is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. Under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which has yet to enter into force, parties agree not to carry out any nuclear explosions. The United States supports the work of the CTBTO to build up a verification regime in preparation for the treaty’s entry into force. The Administration’s fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring described ongoing interagency efforts to support nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and includes information about relevant national priorities, capability gaps, R&D initiatives, and roles and responsibilities. The 2018 plan (40 pages) is longer and more detailed than the 2015 plan (2 pages) or the 2017 update (4 pages). The bulk of the 2018 plan is contained in two chapters—one chapter broadly describes U.S. and international efforts and roles and responsibilities, and the other chapter describes ongoing U.S. R&D efforts. We found the Administration’s 2018 plan provided details on each of the four major reporting requirements called for in the fiscal year 2018 NDAA with the exception of future costs and funding needs (see table 1). The first reporting requirement called for a plan and roadmap for verification, detection, and monitoring with respect to policy, operations, and research, development, testing, and evaluation, including— Identifying requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring; Identifying and integrating roles, responsibilities, and planning for verification, detection, and monitoring activities; and The costs and funding requirements over 10 years for these activities. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on verification, detection, and monitoring requirements and roles and responsibilities, but did not provide details on future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. We found that the plan identified requirements for verification, detection, and monitoring as required. To identify these requirements, the plan notes that interagency partners first identified a set of verification and monitoring priorities. From these priorities they identified a number of technical gaps. The plan then described dozens of examples of R&D efforts and non-technical activities to address those technical gaps. For example, for one gap the plan identifies eight current efforts to address this gap, including continued Department of Energy and NNSA investment in sensor capabilities that are small, light, and can operate in low power. We found that the plan provided details on the requirement to identify and integrate roles and responsibilities and planning. The plan includes details of the roles and responsibilities of interagency partners and international bodies that cooperate in the nonproliferation realm. For example, the plan describes how the Department of Defense is to support U.S. verification activities under the CTBT, including the installation, operation, and maintenance of U.S. International Monitoring Systems. We found that the plan did not identify costs and funding needs over a 10- year period. NNSA officials stated that they believed providing funding information over a 10-year period is unrealistic for several reasons. First, according to NNSA officials, it is not feasible to achieve agreement on actual or implied budgets outside of the existing President’s budget process. Second, according to NNSA officials, agencies have little influence over the funding priorities of other departments outside of existing budget efforts. Third, according to NNSA officials, long-term funding estimates are infeasible because the President’s budget only identifies funding levels five years into the future. However, the 2018 NDAA did not ask for budget information. Instead, the NDAA reporting requirement called for long-term costs and funding information necessary to support the verification and monitoring activities in the plan. Finally, NNSA officials told us that they and officials from other agencies briefed the appropriate congressional committees prior to the release of the 2018 plan, and discussed the challenges with providing cost and funding data. According to NNSA officials, they verified with the congressional committees that providing such information in the plan would be impractical. We have previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. NNSA as well as other agencies within the federal government already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates. For example, in June 2014, we reported on 10-year estimates for sustaining and modernizing U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities. As we found in this and other reports, even when budgets are preliminary or not yet known, plans that include a range of potential estimates help Congress prioritize projects and funding. Because the plan does not include any information on interagency costs and funding needs, it limits 1) congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation’s verification and monitoring efforts and 2) Congress’s ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort. In addition, including estimates of future costs and funding needs in the plan can help ensure that interagency partners understand the amount of resources necessary to support verification and monitoring efforts, and determine if these resources align with agency activities. We have previously reported on the importance of identifying resources among collaborating agencies; we noted that without information on resource contributions from partners in a collaborative effort, there is less assurance that agency contributions are appropriate to successfully sustain the effort. Similarly, providing information on future costs and funding needs is important to help interagency partners coordinate and develop long-term strategic plans that align with future interagency efforts. We have found that for strategic planning to be done well, plans should demonstrate alignment between activities, core processes, and resources that support mission outcome. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources for interagency efforts and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. The second reporting requirement called for an international engagement plan for building cooperation and transparency—including bilateral and multilateral efforts—to improve inspections, detection, and monitoring activities. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The 2018 plan reiterates the nation’s commitment to the NPT and includes information on IAEA’s safeguards programs and U.S support for those programs. For example, under the plan, interagency partners are to continue to encourage countries through diplomatic outreach to conclude Additional Protocol agreements with IAEA. The third reporting requirement called for the plan to describe current and planned R&D efforts toward improving monitoring, detection, and in-field inspection and analysis capabilities, including persistent surveillance, remote monitoring, and rapid analysis of large data sets; and measures to coordinate technical and operational requirements early in the process. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The plan includes detail on a wide range of R&D efforts and non-technical efforts that agencies are pursuing. For example, the plan reports that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is starting a program that models millions of nodes and billions of connections to support the detection of WMD proliferation activities. In addition, the plan describes interagency groups involved in coordinating R&D requirements, such as the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Nuclear Defense Research and Development. The fourth reporting requirement called for the plan to describe the engagement of relevant federal departments and agencies; the military departments; national laboratories; industry; and academia. We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The plan includes detail on the roles and responsibilities for interagency partners, as well as information on interagency organizations and working groups to coordinate efforts and reduce duplication. For example, the plan discusses the Department of State’s efforts to lead the interagency policy process on nonproliferation and manage global U.S. security policy, and the Department of Defense’s support of U.S. diplomatic efforts, including agreements with other defense departments, R&D cooperation, and multinational exercises. This 2018 plan represents the third effort by Administrations to address the nation’s nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring efforts. The 2018 plan provides more detail on these efforts than the 2015 plan and 2017 update. However, the plan does not include estimates of future costs and funding needs as required by the fiscal year 2018 NDAA. Costs and funding information can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify potential long-term funding needs. Similarly, costs and funding information helps interagency partners understand what resources they are expected to contribute in the future and helps to ensure long-term strategic plans reflect an alignment between resources and interagency activities. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and interagency activities, and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. We are making the following recommendation to NNSA: The Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan for verification and monitoring estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. (Recommendation 1) We provided NNSA with a draft of this report for review and comment. NNSA provided written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in appendix I; the agency neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation to include estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in its plan for nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring. However, NNSA stated that it planned no further action with regard to costs and funding data. NNSA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. NNSA stated that it appreciated our recognition of improvements in the 2018 plan for verification and monitoring over the 2015 plan and the 2017 update. In its written comments, NNSA acknowledged that it did not include interagency cost and funding requirements in the 2018 plan over 10 years as required in the NDAA. The agency stated that it briefed the appropriate congressional committees before the release of the plan about the challenges and feasibility of providing the cost and funding data and received no objections on the omission of the data from the plan. NNSA also stated that it informed us of the briefings. We have added clarification in our report that NNSA officials believed they received agreement from congressional staff to exclude funding and cost estimates from its plan. NNSA stated that the NDAA did not prioritize the relative importance of the reporting requirements, and that we disproportionately weighted the one omission in our assessment, effectively overstating the importance of providing cost and funding information. In addition, NNSA identified challenges to the feasibility of providing interagency out-year cost and funding estimates, including the difficulty to quantify the level of R&D and associated funding required to achieve specific outcomes and that departments and agencies are unable to commit to aligning 10 year funding estimates with individual agencies’ timelines and internal processes for planning, programming, budgeting, and execution. NNSA’s statement suggests that it views nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring programs as being unique and different from other federal programs and that they should therefore be exempt from estimating their potential long-term resource burden on the federal budget. We disagree. Developing future cost and funding estimates for programs is central to effective interagency planning efforts. The efforts described in NNSA’s 2018 nuclear verification and monitoring plan span a diverse range of activities that are implemented across multiple agencies. The absence of cost and funding estimates for these efforts in NNSA’s plan raises questions as to whether there is an effective interagency process to coordinate these efforts and if the process is taking adequate account of resource constraints and making realistic assessments of program resource needs. In addition, information on future cost and funding estimates of federal programs provides Congress with a better understanding of the potential long-term funding needs and costs of the diverse efforts supporting the proliferation verification and monitoring mission. We believe this big picture view is important given the multiple congressional committees of jurisdiction—including appropriations, authorization, and oversight committees—for the efforts identified in NNSA’s plan. Regarding the feasibility of providing 10-year cost and funding estimates, we recognize the difficulty and uncertainty agencies face in estimating future funding needs. However, we do not believe developing such estimates is impossible. As we reported, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) prepare an annual plan with 10 year cost and funding estimates for their ongoing nuclear sustainment and modernization efforts, including R&D efforts. NNSA also provided general technical comments addressing our findings on the cost and funding estimates that were not included in the plan, including comments on NNSA’s authority to obtain 10-year estimates from other agencies, and on the examples we cited of other interagency plans that include similar estimates. NNSA stated that it did not have authority to require other agencies to submit 10-year budget estimates for their efforts that are included in the plan. We noted in our report that Congress directed the President to include this element in the nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring plan. However, responsibility to prepare and submit the plan was delegated by the President to DOE. NNSA commented that the joint DOD-DOE annual nuclear sustainment and modernization plan is not comparable to the NNSA plan because the former primarily addresses capital projects and other material products, while the latter primarily addresses R&D activities. The reporting requirements for NNSA’s nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring plan were not limited to R&D efforts, but included cost and funding estimates for related activities and capabilities, including policy, operations, testing, and evaluation. NNSA’s comment focuses only on the difficulty of addressing cost and funding estimates for only one aspect (R&D) of nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and ignores the possibility that estimates for non-R&D efforts may be more feasible and less difficult to report. Moreover, we have reported that the joint DOD- DOE plan on nuclear modernization includes 10-year DOD and DOE estimates for R&D, as well as estimates for related modernization efforts, including infrastructure, nuclear weapon life extension programs, delivery systems, nuclear command, control, and communications systems, and other related activities.

To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017. GAO reported in March 2018 that this plan and update generally did not address the congressionally mandated reporting requirements. In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress directed the Administration to develop another plan and included a provision for GAO to review the plan. This report assesses whether the Administration's new plan provided details on the reporting requirements included in the NDAA. To determine whether the plan provided details on the reporting requirements, GAO reviewed the fiscal year 2018 plan and assessed whether the plan included details for each of the elements as required by the NDAA. GAO found that the 2018 plan provided details on most of the reporting requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2018, but did not include information on future costs and funding needs (see table below). In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018. According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes. GAO recommends that the Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but said it planned no further action. GAO maintains that the recommendation is valid."], "length": 3249, "dataset": "gov_report_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0fd7e5a78ef1d4399385aba1b8d4bdbacb27592752b4c6f9"}
{"input": "", "context": "The President's budget for FY2020 consists of a multivolume set of materials issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The materials contain information on new budget proposals, summ ary tables, detailed financial information on individual programs and accounts, economic analysis, historical data, explanations of the budget processes, and supporting documents. Every year the President submits these materials to Congress at the start of the budget cycle for the next fiscal year. The President's submission is required on or after the first Monday in January, but no later than the first Monday in February (31 U.S.C. §1105(a)). However, incoming presidential Administrations do not generally release multivolume budget sets in February. This year the President released the budget submission, in two installments, on March 11, and March 18, 2019. Other budget-related documents include the annual Economic Report of the President , issued by the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Budget and Economic Outlook , an annual publication issued by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Details on these publications are included in this report. Both OMB and the Government Publishing Office (GPO) provide internet access to the main and supporting budget documents, spreadsheet files, the public budget database, and budget amendments and supplementals proposed by the President; see http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget and https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET , respectively. OMB provides additional summary table information on agency budgets and key issues in the form of fact sheets, available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fact-sheets/ . Information on purchasing print copies of these documents appears below, along with a brief description of the contents of each document. The annual budget volume contains information, charts, and graphs pertaining to the President's new budget proposals and overviews of government activities by topic (e.g., \"Modernizing Government\" and \"A Budget for a Better American\") within the FY2020 Budget volume. Summary Tables (pp. 105-139) contain projections of budget baselines, receipts, and outlays; deficits; debt; discretionary spending; and economic projections from FY2019 to FY2029. Federal programs that have been recommended by the Administration for termination or reduction are detailed in the document entitled Major Savings and Reforms , available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/msar-fy2020.pdf .

Some data files are also included in spreadsheet format. The CD-ROM provides software to search, display, and print. (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) This volume includes economic, accounting, and crosscutting analyses of government programs and activities designed to highlight specific subject areas. It also includes information on federal receipts and collections, analysis of federal spending, detailed information on federal borrowing and debt, baseline or current service estimates, and other technical presentations. Chapter 17, \"Aid to State and Local Governments,\" contains a series of tables (pp. 231-247) that provide selected grant and other federal assistance data by state. The FY2020 Analytical Perspectives volume contains supplemental materials including tables showing the budget by agency and account and by function, subfunction, and program. The supplemental materials also include data on direct and guaranteed loan transactions of the federal government. The supplemental material is available on a CD-ROM, in the printed document, or on the GPO website at https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/BUDGET . (GPO stock number 041-001-00732-6, $52, 360 pages) Designed primarily for the use of the House and Senate appropriations committees, the Appendix contains more detailed financial information on individual programs and appropriations accounts than any of the other budget documents submitted by the President. In many presidential budget submissions, the volume often provides the following information for agencies: proposed text of the appropriation language, budget schedules for each account, new legislative proposals, explanations of the work to be performed and the funds needed, and proposed general provisions applicable to the appropriations of entire agencies or groups of agencies. Typically, elements within this information are distinguished by varying font, so that, for example, proposed appropriations (italics) and prior year funding (brackets and no italics) can be compared at a glance: For expenses necessary for the administration of the Department of Justice, [$111,500,000] $125,896,000 , of which not to exceed $4,000,000 for security and construction of Department of Justice facilities shall remain available until expended. ( Department of Justice Appropriations Act, 2016 ) Note that the FY2020 budget appendix does not pair prior year funding figures with proposed appropriations. (GPO stock number 041-001-00733-4, $82, 1,3 20 pages) These detailed tables cover budget deficit/surplus, outlays, receipts, discretionary and mandatory spending, federal debt, federal employment, payments for individuals, spending by function and agency, and grants to states and local governments. These tables provide some data from 1940 (or earlier) and estimates through FY2024. Historical data are adjusted by OMB to be consistent with data in the FY2020 budget and to provide comparability over time. This year the Historical Tables are available online in spreadsheet and PDF instead of print. The Historical Tables are available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/ . This year's annual Economic Report of the President was submitted by the Council of Economic Advisers and transmitted to Congress in March 2019. It presents the Administration's economic policies and contains the annual report of the Council of Economic Advisers. It also presents an overview of the nation's economic progress using text and extensive data appendices. Appendix B of the Economic Report includes current and historical statistics on major aspects of economic activity (pp. 625-705). Statistics include national income and expenditures, government finance, population, employment, wages, productivity, prices, debt measures, corporate finance, and international statistics.

This annual document is typically released in the summer following the President's budget submission. The FY2020 document is not currently available, but should be available in the summer on the OMB website . (GPO stock number and ordering information not yet available) After the President's budget documents are released, Congress begins to hold hearings on agency budget requests. Agencies must submit their budget justifications to the appropriations subcommittees holding the hearings. Budget justifications generally contain more detailed descriptions of an agency's proposals and programs than are provided in the President's budget documents. As mandated by OMB in Section 22.6 of the 2006 edition of Circular A-11 and subsequent editions, executive agencies are required to post their congressional budget justification materials on the internet within two weeks of transmittal to Congress. Typically, Administration budget requests appear along with actual numbers for the previous fiscal year. The content and structure of these submissions may vary and some materials may not correspond exactly with the data and information provided to Congress in other fiscal years. A short overview on the agency budget justification request can be found within CRS Report RS20268, Agency Justification of the President's Budget , by Michelle D. Christensen. OMB produces a number of additional documents that further examines certain budgetary categories, including the Federal Credit Supplement , which provides summary information on certain federal loan and loan guarantee programs through a series of detailed tables; Object Class Analysis , a report on the federal government's obligations as broken out by object classifications; and Balances of Budget Authority , which provides data on unobligated balances carried forward to the start of the next fiscal year. All three documents are available online at https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/supplemental-materials/ . OMB also maintains a publicly accessible database in Excel and comma delimited format called the Public Budget Database . This resource provides account level detail data on budget authority for the years FY1976 to FY2024, and budget outlays and budget receipts for FY1962 to FY2024.

{"input": "", "context": "The attrition among VHA physicians has been of particular concern given that the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) anticipates that by 2025 the national demand for physician services will exceed supply. HRSA’s Office of Rural Health Policy reported, in 2017, that physician shortages were exacerbated in rural areas, where communities struggle to attract and keep well-trained providers. This difficulty has posed a particular challenge for VHA, as approximately one in four VAMCs is located in a rural area. Most physicians providing care at VAMCs are employed by VHA. VHA also supplements the capacity of its employed physician staff by acquiring additional physician services through fee-basis arrangements or contracts. Under fee-basis arrangements, providers are paid a pre- agreed-upon amount for each service provided. Under contracts, physician services may be obtained on a short-term basis; for example, through sole-source contracts with academic affiliates. VAMCs may also use physicians who volunteer their time, who are referred to as work- without-compensation providers. In addition to VHA-employed, contract, and fee-basis physicians, VAMCs often supplement their capacity by using physician trainees, who include medical residents and advanced fellows. In 2016, 135 of the 170 VAMCs had active physician training programs. According to VHA officials, there were 43,768 medical residents who trained at a VAMC in 2016. VHA has been expanding its physician training program, as directed by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, as amended. In 2017, VHA added 175 physician trainee positions across VAMCs nationwide, including 3 VAMCs that did not have physician trainees prior to this expansion. VHA’s objective is to add 953 additional physician trainee positions to its VAMCs by 2025 in order to improve access and hire additional physicians. Further, VHA officials told us they want to continue to add new positions that would eventually allow all VAMCs access to physician trainees. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA’s data on physicians who provided care at VAMCs were incomplete. Specifically, we found that VHA had data on the number of mission-critical physicians it employed (more than 11,000) and who provided services on a fee-basis (about 2,800), but lacked data on the number of contract physicians and physician trainees. As a result, VHA did not have data on the extent to which VAMCs used these arrangements and thus, underestimated its physician use overall. Therefore, VHA was unable to ensure that its workforce planning processes sufficiently addressed any gaps in staffing. All six VAMCs included in our review used at least one type of arrangement other than employment for physicians, and five of the six used contract physicians or physician trainees. (See fig. 1.) On average, contract and fee-basis physicians made up 5 to 40 percent of the physicians in a given mission-critical physician occupation at each VAMC in our review. For example, officials from a large, highly complex VAMC told us that, in March 2017, they augmented the 86 employed primary care physicians with eight contract and three fee-basis physicians, which represented about 16 percent of their primary care physician workforce. Further, this VAMC also had about 64 primary care physician trainees providing certain medical services under the supervision of a senior physician. During the course of our work for the October 2017 report, VHA officials told us that its personnel databases were designed to manage VHA’s payroll systems, but that these databases did not contain information on contract physicians or physician trainees. VHA officials told us they were working to include information on physician trainees in a new human resources (HR) database—HR Smart—which at the time of our review, was scheduled to be implemented in 2017. However, these officials were not aware of plans to add information to the database on contract physicians. Instead, VAMC leaders used locally devised methods to identify and track contract physicians, fee-basis physicians, and physician trainees. For example, one VAMC in our October 2017 review used a locally maintained spreadsheet to track its physicians under arrangements other than employment, while another VAMC asked department leaders to identify how many of these provided care within their respective departments. At each of the six VAMCs in our review, we found that department leaders were generally knowledgeable about the total number of physicians that provided care within the departments they managed. However, this locally maintained information was not readily accessible by VHA officials. To address the limitations in VHA’s data, we recommended in our October 2017 report that VHA develop and implement a process to accurately count all physicians providing care at each of its VAMCs, including physicians not employed by VHA. VHA did not concur with this recommendation, stating that it uses other tools for workforce planning. However, a VHA official acknowledged that data sources used for workforce planning may not include all types of contract physicians or work-without-compensation physicians. As we discussed in our prior report, implementing such a systematic process would eliminate the need for individual VAMCs to use their own mechanisms, such as a locally developed and maintained spreadsheet to track its physician workforce, as was done by one VAMC in our prior review. Further, local mechanisms may not be readily accessible to VHA officials engaged in workforce planning, resulting in incomplete information for decision-making purposes. Since our report, VHA officials told us that they have completed implementation of HR Smart, which provides the capability to track every position with a unique position number, and each employee’s full employment history. However, VHA officials told us they do not plan to enhance the capability of HR Smart to track contractors. We continue to believe that having a systematic and consistent process to account for all physicians who provide care across VAMCs, including physicians not employed by VHA, would help address concerns that VHA is unable to identify all physicians providing care at its VAMCs. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA gave responsibility for determining staffing needs to its VAMCs and provided its facilities with guidance, through policies and directives, on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed for some physician occupations. Specifically, VHA provided this guidance for primary care, mental health, and emergency medicine, but lacked sufficient guidance for its medical and surgical specialties, including occupations such as gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. For these occupations, VHA provided guidance on the minimum number of physicians, but did not provide information on how to determine appropriate staffing levels for physicians or support staff based on the need for care. Specifically, the VHA guidance available at the time set a minimum requirement that VAMCs of a certain complexity level have at least one gastroenterologist and one orthopedic surgeon that is available within 15 minutes by phone or 60 minutes in person 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. VHA guidance did not include information on how to use data, such as workload data, to manage the demand for care or help inform staffing levels for these physician occupations beyond this minimum requirement. Officials from four of the six VAMCs we reviewed for our October 2017 report told us that because they lacked (1) guidance on how to determine the number of physicians and support staff needed, and (2) data on how their staffing levels compared with those of similar VAMCs, they were sometimes unsure whether their staffing levels were adequate. In our October 2017 report, we discussed that VHA had previously established, in 2016, a specialty physician staffing workgroup that examined the relationships between staffing levels, provider workload and productivity, veterans’ access, and cost across VAMCs for its medical and surgical specialties, including gastroenterology and orthopedic surgery. This group’s work culminated in a January 2017 report that found VHA was unable to assess and report on the staffing at each VAMC, as required by the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, because a staffing model for specialty care had not been established and applied across VAMCs. This report made a number of recommendations, including that VHA provide guidance to its VAMCs on what level of staffing is appropriate for its mission-critical physician occupations. However, as we noted in our October 2017 report, VHA leadership had not yet taken steps to develop such staffing guidance. We reported that, according to a VHA official, other priorities were taking precedence and continued work in this area had not yet been approved by VHA leadership. Although VHA officials agreed that further steps should be taken, they did not indicate when these would occur. In our report, we concluded that until VHA issues guidance on staffing levels for certain physician occupations that provide specialty care to veterans, there would continue to be ambiguity for VAMCs on how to determine appropriate staffing levels. To address this, we recommended that VHA develop and issue guidance to VAMCs on determining appropriate staffing levels for all mission-critical physician occupations. VHA concurred with our recommendation and reported it would evaluate and develop staffing guidance for its medical and surgical specialties. Since our report, VHA officials told us that on November 27, 2017, the Executive-in-Charge for VHA signed the specialty care workgroup charter. The primary goal of the workgroup is to develop a specialty care staffing model that will include staffing information for all specialty care. VHA anticipates completing its work and issuing staffing guidance by December 2018. In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA used various strategies to recruit and retain its physician workforce, including providing assistance recruiting for mission-critical physician occupations through the National Recruitment Program; policies and guidance; financial incentives to enhance hiring and retention offers; and a national physician training program. (See table 1.) In our October 2017 report, we found that VHA faced challenges using its strategies for recruiting and retaining physicians. For example, according to VHA officials, budget shortfalls in the Education Debt Reduction Program—which reimburses qualifying education loan debt for employees, including physicians, in hard-to-recruit positions—reduced VAMCs’ ability to offer this recruitment incentive to physician candidates. In addition, the relatively small number of physician recruiters in VHA’s National Recruitment Program—19 recruiters for the 170 VAMCs at the time of our report—limited the
