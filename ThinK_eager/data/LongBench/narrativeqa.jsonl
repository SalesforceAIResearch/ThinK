I won’t pretend to have\ntaken his vast measure on that first occasion, but I think I had achieved\na glimpse of what the privilege of his acquaintance might mean for many\npersons in the way of charges accepted.  He had been a great experience,\nand it was this perhaps that had put me into the frame of foreseeing how\nwe should all, sooner or later, have the honour of dealing with him as a\nwhole.  Whatever impression I then received of the amount of this total,\nI had a full enough vision of the patience of the Mulvilles.  He was to\nstay all the winter: Adelaide dropped it in a tone that drew the sting\nfrom the inevitable emphasis.  These excellent people might indeed have\nbeen content to give the circle of hospitality a diameter of six months;\nbut if they didn’t say he was to stay all summer as well it was only\nbecause this was more than they ventured to hope.  I remember that at\ndinner that evening he wore slippers, new and predominantly purple, of\nsome queer carpet-stuff; but the Mulvilles were still in the stage of\nsupposing that he might be snatched from them by higher bidders.  At a\nlater time they grew, poor dears, to fear no snatching; but theirs was a\nfidelity which needed no help from competition to make them proud.\nWonderful indeed as, when all was said, you inevitably pronounced Frank\nSaltram, it was not to be overlooked that the Kent Mulvilles were in\ntheir way still more extraordinary: as striking an instance as could\neasily be encountered of the familiar truth that remarkable men find\nremarkable conveniences.\n\nThey had sent for me from Wimbledon to come out and dine, and there had\nbeen an implication in Adelaide’s note—judged by her notes alone she\nmight have been thought silly—that it was a case in which something\nmomentous was to be determined or done.  I had never known them not be in\na “state” about somebody, and I dare say I tried to be droll on this\npoint in accepting their invitation.  On finding myself in the presence\nof their latest discovery I had not at first felt irreverence droop—and,\nthank heaven, I have never been absolutely deprived of that alternative\nin Mr. Saltram’s company.  I saw, however—I hasten to declare it—that\ncompared to this specimen their other phoenixes had been birds of\ninconsiderable feather, and I afterwards took credit to myself for not\nhaving even in primal bewilderments made a mistake about the essence of\nthe man.  He had an incomparable gift; I never was blind to it—it dazzles\nme still.  It dazzles me perhaps even more in remembrance than in fact,\nfor I’m not unaware that for so rare a subject the imagination goes to\nsome expense, inserting a jewel here and there or giving a twist to a\nplume.  How the art of portraiture would rejoice in this figure if the\nart of portraiture had only the canvas!  Nature, in truth, had largely\nrounded it, and if memory, hovering about it, sometimes holds her breath,\nthis is because the voice that comes back was really golden.\n\nThough the great man was an inmate and didn’t dress, he kept dinner on\nthis occasion waiting, and the first words he uttered on coming into the\nroom were an elated announcement to Mulville that he had found out\nsomething.  Not catching the allusion and gaping doubtless a little at\nhis face, I privately asked Adelaide what he had found out.  I shall\nnever forget the look she gave me as she replied: “Everything!”  She\nreally believed it.  At that moment, at any rate, he had found out that\nthe mercy of the Mulvilles was infinite.  He had previously of course\ndiscovered, as I had myself for that matter, that their dinners were\nsoignés.  Let me not indeed, in saying this, neglect to declare that I\nshall falsify my counterfeit if I seem to hint that there was in his\nnature any ounce of calculation.  He took whatever came, but he never\nplotted for it, and no man who was so much of an absorbent can ever have\nbeen so little of a parasite.  He had a system of the universe, but he\nhad no system of sponging—that was quite hand-to-mouth.  He had fine\ngross easy senses, but it was not his good-natured appetite that wrought\nconfusion.  If he had loved us for our dinners we could have paid with\nour dinners, and it would have been a great economy of finer matter.  I\nmake free in these connexions with the plural possessive because if I was\nnever able to do what the Mulvilles did, and people with still bigger\nhouses and simpler charities, I met, first and last, every demand of\nreflexion, of emotion—particularly perhaps those of gratitude and of\nresentment.  No one, I think, paid the tribute of giving him up so often,\nand if it’s rendering honour to borrow wisdom I’ve a right to talk of my\nsacrifices.  He yielded lessons as the sea yields fish—I lived for a\nwhile on this diet.  Sometimes it almost appeared to me that his massive\nmonstrous failure—if failure after all it was—had been designed for my\nprivate recreation.  He fairly pampered my curiosity; but the history of\nthat experience would take me too far.  This is not the large canvas I\njust now spoke of, and I wouldn’t have approached him with my present\nhand had it been a question of all the features.  Frank Saltram’s\nfeatures, for artistic purposes, are verily the anecdotes that are to be\ngathered.  Their name is legion, and this is only one, of which the\ninterest is that it concerns even more closely several other persons.\nSuch episodes, as one looks back, are the little dramas that made up the\ninnumerable facets of the big drama—which is yet to be reported.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIT is furthermore remarkable that though the two stories are distinct—my\nown, as it were, and this other—they equally began, in a manner, the\nfirst night of my acquaintance with Frank Saltram, the night I came back\nfrom Wimbledon so agitated with a new sense of life that, in London, for\nthe very thrill of it, I could only walk home.  Walking and swinging my\nstick, I overtook, at Buckingham Gate, George Gravener, and George\nGravener’s story may be said to have begun with my making him, as our\npaths lay together, come home with me for a talk.  I duly remember, let\nme parenthesise, that it was still more that of another person, and also\nthat several years were to elapse before it was to extend to a second\nchapter.  I had much to say to him, none the less, about my visit to the\nMulvilles, whom he more indifferently knew, and I was at any rate so\namusing that for long afterwards he never encountered me without asking\nfor news of the old man of the sea.  I hadn’t said Mr. Saltram was old,\nand it was to be seen that he was of an age to outweather George\nGravener.  I had at that time a lodging in Ebury Street, and Gravener was\nstaying at his brother’s empty house in Eaton Square.  At Cambridge, five\nyears before, even in our devastating set, his intellectual power had\nseemed to me almost awful.  Some one had once asked me privately, with\nblanched cheeks, what it was then that after all such a mind as that left\nstanding.  “It leaves itself!” I could recollect devoutly replying.  I\ncould smile at present for this remembrance, since before we got to Ebury\nStreet I was struck with the fact that, save in the sense of being well\nset up on his legs, George Gravener had actually ceased to tower.  The\nuniverse he laid low had somehow bloomed again—the usual eminences were\nvisible.  I wondered whether he had lost his humour, or only, dreadful\nthought, had never had any—not even when I had fancied him most\nAristophanesque.  What was the need of appealing to laughter, however, I\ncould enviously enquire, where you might appeal so confidently to\nmeasurement?  Mr. Saltram’s queer figure, his thick nose and hanging lip,\nwere fresh to me: in the light of my old friend’s fine cold symmetry they\npresented mere success in amusing as the refuge of conscious ugliness.\nAlready, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary\nas if he were fifty and popular.  In my scrap of a residence—he had a\nworldling’s eye for its futile conveniences, but never a comrade’s joke—I\nsounded Frank Saltram in his ears; a circumstance I mention in order to\nnote that even then I was surprised at his impatience of my enlivenment.\nAs he had never before heard of the personage it took indeed the form of\nimpatience of the preposterous Mulvilles, his relation to whom, like\nmine, had had its origin in an early, a childish intimacy with the young\nAdelaide, the fruit of multiplied ties in the previous generation.  When\nshe married Kent Mulville, who was older than Gravener and I and much\nmore amiable, I gained a friend, but Gravener practically lost one.  We\nreacted in different ways from the form taken by what he called their\ndeplorable social action—the form (the term was also his) of nasty\nsecond-rate gush.  I may have held in my ‘for intérieur’ that the good\npeople at Wimbledon were beautiful fools, but when he sniffed at them I\ncouldn’t help taking the opposite line, for I already felt that even\nshould we happen to agree it would always be for reasons that differed.\nIt came home to me that he was admirably British as, without so much as a\nsociable sneer at my bookbinder, he turned away from the serried rows of\nmy little French library.\n\n“Of course I’ve never seen the fellow, but it’s clear enough he’s a\nhumbug.”\n\n“Clear ‘enough’ is just what it isn’t,” I replied; “if it only were!”\nThat ejaculation on my part must have been the beginning of what was to\nbe later a long ache for final frivolous rest.  Gravener was profound\nenough to remark after a moment that in the first place he couldn’t be\nanything but a Dissenter, and when I answered that the very note of his\nfascination was his extraordinary speculative breadth my friend retorted\nthat there was no cad like your cultivated cad, and that I might depend\nupon discovering—since I had had the levity not already to have\nenquired—that my shining light proceeded, a generation back, from a\nMethodist cheesemonger.  I confess I was struck with his insistence, and\nI said, after reflexion: “It may be—I admit it may be; but why on earth\nare you so sure?”—asking the question mainly to lay him the trap of\nsaying that it was because the poor man didn’t dress for dinner.  He took\nan instant to circumvent my trap and come blandly out the other side.\n\n“Because the Kent Mulvilles have invented him.  They’ve an infallible\nhand for frauds.  All their geese are swans.  They were born to be duped,\nthey like it, they cry for it, they don’t know anything from anything,\nand they disgust one—luckily perhaps!—with Christian charity.”  His\nvehemence was doubtless an accident, but it might have been a strange\nforeknowledge.  I forget what protest I dropped; it was at any rate\nsomething that led him to go on after a moment: “I only ask one\nthing—it’s perfectly simple.  Is a man, in a given case, a real\ngentleman?”\n\n“A real gentleman, my dear fellow—that’s so soon said!”\n\n“Not so soon when he isn’t!  If they’ve got hold of one this time he must\nbe a great rascal!”\n\n“I might feel injured,” I answered, “if I didn’t reflect that they don’t\nrave about me.”\n\n“Don’t be too sure!  I’ll grant that he’s a gentleman,” Gravener\npresently added, “if you’ll admit that he’s a scamp.”\n\n“I don’t know which to admire most, your logic or your benevolence.”\n\nMy friend coloured at this, but he didn’t change the subject.  “Where did\nthey pick him up?”\n\n“I think they were struck with something he had published.”\n\n“I can fancy the dreary thing!”\n\n“I believe they found out he had all sorts of worries and difficulties.”\n\n“That of course wasn’t to be endured, so they jumped at the privilege of\npaying his debts!”  I professed that I knew nothing about his debts, and\nI reminded my visitor that though the dear Mulvilles were angels they\nwere neither idiots nor millionaires.  What they mainly aimed at was\nreuniting Mr. Saltram to his wife.  “I was expecting to hear he has\nbasely abandoned her,” Gravener went on, at this, “and I’m too glad you\ndon’t disappoint me.”\n\nI tried to recall exactly what Mrs. Mulville had told me.  “He didn’t\nleave her—no.  It’s she who has left him.”\n\n“Left him to us?” Gravener asked.  “The monster—many thanks!  I decline\nto take him.”\n\n“You’ll hear more about him in spite of yourself.  I can’t, no, I really\ncan’t resist the impression that he’s a big man.”  I was already\nmastering—to my shame perhaps be it said—just the tone my old friend\nleast liked.\n\n“It’s doubtless only a trifle,” he returned, “but you haven’t happened to\nmention what his reputation’s to rest on.”\n\n“Why on what I began by boring you with—his extraordinary mind.”\n\n“As exhibited in his writings?”\n\n“Possibly in his writings, but certainly in his talk, which is far and\naway the richest I ever listened to.”\n\n“And what’s it all about?”\n\n“My dear fellow, don’t ask me!  About everything!” I pursued, reminding\nmyself of poor Adelaide.  “About his ideas of things,” I then more\ncharitably added.  “You must have heard him to know what I mean—it’s\nunlike anything that ever was heard.”  I coloured, I admit, I overcharged\na little, for such a picture was an anticipation of Saltram’s later\ndevelopment and still more of my fuller acquaintance with him.  However,\nI really expressed, a little lyrically perhaps, my actual imagination of\nhim when I proceeded to declare that, in a cloud of tradition, of legend,\nhe might very well go down to posterity as the greatest of all great\ntalkers.  Before we parted George Gravener had wondered why such a row\nshould be made about a chatterbox the more and why he should be pampered\nand pensioned.  The greater the wind-bag the greater the calamity.  Out\nof proportion to everything else on earth had come to be this wagging of\nthe tongue.  We were drenched with talk—our wretched age was dying of it.\nI differed from him here sincerely, only going so far as to concede, and\ngladly, that we were drenched with sound.  It was not however the mere\nspeakers who were killing us—it was the mere stammerers.  Fine talk was\nas rare as it was refreshing—the gift of the gods themselves, the one\nstarry spangle on the ragged cloak of humanity.  How many men were there\nwho rose to this privilege, of how many masters of conversation could he\nboast the acquaintance?  Dying of talk?—why we were dying of the lack of\nit!  Bad writing wasn’t talk, as many people seemed to think, and even\ngood wasn’t always to be compared to it.  From the best talk indeed the\nbest writing had something to learn.  I fancifully added that we too\nshould peradventure be gilded by the legend, should be pointed at for\nhaving listened, for having actually heard.  Gravener, who had glanced at\nhis watch and discovered it was midnight, found to all this a retort\nbeautifully characteristic of him.\n\n“There’s one little fact to be borne in mind in the presence equally of\nthe best talk and of the worst.”  He looked, in saying this, as if he\nmeant great things, and I was sure he could only mean once more that\nneither of them mattered if a man wasn’t a real gentleman.  Perhaps it\nwas what he did mean; he deprived me however of the exultation of being\nright by putting the truth in a slightly different way.  “The only thing\nthat really counts for one’s estimate of a person is his conduct.”  He\nhad his watch still in his palm, and I reproached him with unfair play in\nhaving ascertained beforehand that it was now the hour at which I always\ngave in.  My pleasantry so far failed to mollify him that he promptly\nadded that to the rule he had just enunciated there was absolutely no\nexception.\n\n“None whatever?”\n\n“None whatever.”\n\n“Trust me then to try to be good at any price!” I laughed as I went with\nhim to the door.  “I declare I will be, if I have to be horrible!”\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIF that first night was one of the liveliest, or at any rate was the\nfreshest, of my exaltations, there was another, four years later, that\nwas one of my great discomposures.  Repetition, I well knew by this time,\nwas the secret of Saltram’s power to alienate, and of course one would\nnever have seen him at his finest if one hadn’t seen him in his remorses.\nThey set in mainly at this season and were magnificent, elemental,\norchestral.  I was quite aware that one of these atmospheric disturbances\nwas now due; but none the less, in our arduous attempt to set him on his\nfeet as a lecturer, it was impossible not to feel that two failures were\na large order, as we said, for a short course of five.  This was the\nsecond time, and it was past nine o’clock; the audience, a muster\nunprecedented and really encouraging, had fortunately the attitude of\nblandness that might have been looked for in persons whom the promise of\n(if I’m not mistaken) An Analysis of Primary Ideas had drawn to the\nneighbourhood of Upper Baker Street.  There was in those days in that\nregion a petty lecture-hall to be secured on terms as moderate as the\nfunds left at our disposal by the irrepressible question of the\nmaintenance of five small Saltrams—I include the mother—and one large\none.  By the time the Saltrams, of different sizes, were all maintained\nwe had pretty well poured out the oil that might have lubricated the\nmachinery for enabling the most original of men to appear to maintain\nthem.\n\nIt was I, the other time, who had been forced into the breach, standing\nup there for an odious lamplit moment to explain to half a dozen thin\nbenches, where earnest brows were virtuously void of anything so cynical\nas a suspicion, that we couldn’t so much as put a finger on Mr. Saltram.\nThere was nothing to plead but that our scouts had been out from the\nearly hours and that we were afraid that on one of his walks abroad—he\ntook one, for meditation, whenever he was to address such a company—some\naccident had disabled or delayed him.  The meditative walks were a\nfiction, for he never, that any one could discover, prepared anything but\na magnificent prospectus; hence his circulars and programmes, of which I\npossess an almost complete collection, are the solemn ghosts of\ngenerations never born.  I put the case, as it seemed to me, at the best;\nbut I admit I had been angry, and Kent Mulville was shocked at my want of\npublic optimism.  This time therefore I left the excuses to his more\npractised patience, only relieving myself in response to a direct appeal\nfrom a young lady next whom, in the hall, I found myself sitting.  My\nposition was an accident, but if it had been calculated the reason would\nscarce have eluded an observer of the fact that no one else in the room\nhad an approach to an appearance.  Our philosopher’s “tail” was\ndeplorably limp.  This visitor was the only person who looked at her\nease, who had come a little in the spirit of adventure.  She seemed to\ncarry amusement in her handsome young head, and her presence spoke, a\nlittle mystifyingly, of a sudden extension of Saltram’s sphere of\ninfluence.  He was doing better than we hoped, and he had chosen such an\noccasion, of all occasions, to succumb to heaven knew which of his fond\ninfirmities.  The young lady produced an impression of auburn hair and\nblack velvet, and had on her other hand a companion of obscurer type,\npresumably a waiting-maid.  She herself might perhaps have been a foreign\ncountess, and before she addressed me I had beguiled our sorry interval\nby finding in her a vague recall of the opening of some novel of Madame\nSand.  It didn’t make her more fathomable to pass in a few minutes from\nthis to the certitude that she was American; it simply engendered\ndepressing reflexions as to the possible check to contributions from\nBoston.  She asked me if, as a person apparently more initiated, I would\nrecommend further waiting, and I answered that if she considered I was on\nmy honour I would privately deprecate it.  Perhaps she didn’t; at any\nrate our talk took a turn that prolonged it till she became aware we were\nleft almost alone.  I presently ascertained she knew Mrs. Saltram, and\nthis explained in a manner the miracle.  The brotherhood of the friends\nof the husband was as nothing to the brotherhood, or perhaps I should say\nthe sisterhood, of the friends of the wife.  Like the Kent Mulvilles I\nbelonged to both fraternities, and even better than they I think I had\nsounded the abyss of Mrs. Saltram’s wrongs.  She bored me to extinction,\nand I knew but too well how she had bored her husband; but there were\nthose who stood by her, the most efficient of whom were indeed the\nhandful of poor Saltram’s backers.  They did her liberal justice, whereas\nher mere patrons and partisans had nothing but hatred for our\nphilosopher.  I’m bound to say it was we, however—we of both camps, as it\nwere—who had always done most for her.\n\nI thought my young lady looked rich—I scarcely knew why; and I hoped she\nhad put her hand in her pocket.  I soon made her out, however, not at all\na fine fanatic—she was but a generous, irresponsible enquirer.  She had\ncome to England to see her aunt, and it was at her aunt’s she had met the\ndreary lady we had all so much on our mind.  I saw she’d help to pass the\ntime when she observed that it was a pity this lady wasn’t intrinsically\nmore interesting.  That was refreshing, for it was an article of faith in\nMrs. Saltram’s circle—at least among those who scorned to know her horrid\nhusband—that she was attractive on her merits.  She was in truth a most\nordinary person, as Saltram himself would have been if he hadn’t been a\nprodigy.  The question of vulgarity had no application to him, but it was\na measure his wife kept challenging you to apply.  I hasten to add that\nthe consequences of your doing so were no sufficient reason for his\nhaving left her to starve.  “He doesn’t seem to have much force of\ncharacter,” said my young lady; at which I laughed out so loud that my\ndeparting friends looked back at me over their shoulders as if I were\nmaking a joke of their discomfiture.  My joke probably cost Saltram a\nsubscription or two, but it helped me on with my interlocutress.  “She\nsays he drinks like a fish,” she sociably continued, “and yet she allows\nthat his mind’s wonderfully clear.”  It was amusing to converse with a\npretty girl who could talk of the clearness of Saltram’s mind.  I\nexpected next to hear she had been assured he was awfully clever.  I\ntried to tell her—I had it almost on my conscience—what was the proper\nway to regard him; an effort attended perhaps more than ever on this\noccasion with the usual effect of my feeling that I wasn’t after all very\nsure of it.  She had come to-night out of high curiosity—she had wanted\nto learn this proper way for herself.  She had read some of his papers\nand hadn’t understood them; but it was at home, at her aunt’s, that her\ncuriosity had been kindled—kindled mainly by his wife’s remarkable\nstories of his want of virtue.  “I suppose they ought to have kept me\naway,” my companion dropped, “and I suppose they’d have done so if I\nhadn’t somehow got an idea that he’s fascinating.  In fact Mrs. Saltram\nherself says he is.”\n\n“So you came to see where the fascination resides?  Well, you’ve seen!”\n\nMy young lady raised fine eyebrows.  “Do you mean in his bad faith?”\n\n“In the extraordinary effects of it; his possession, that is, of some\nquality or other that condemns us in advance to forgive him the\nhumiliation, as I may call it, to which he has subjected us.”\n\n“The humiliation?”\n\n“Why mine, for instance, as one of his guarantors, before you as the\npurchaser of a ticket.”\n\nShe let her charming gay eyes rest on me.  “You don’t look humiliated a\nbit, and if you did I should let you off, disappointed as I am; for the\nmysterious quality you speak of is just the quality I came to see.”\n\n“Oh, you can’t ‘see’ it!” I cried.\n\n“How then do you get at it?”\n\n“You don’t!  You mustn’t suppose he’s good-looking,” I added.\n\n“Why his wife says he’s lovely!”\n\nMy hilarity may have struck her as excessive, but I confess it broke out\nafresh.  Had she acted only in obedience to this singular plea, so\ncharacteristic, on Mrs. Saltram’s part, of what was irritating in the\nnarrowness of that lady’s point of view?  “Mrs. Saltram,” I explained,\n“undervalues him where he’s strongest, so that, to make up for it\nperhaps, she overpraises him where he’s weak.  He’s not, assuredly,\nsuperficially attractive; he’s middle-aged, fat, featureless save for his\ngreat eyes.”\n\n“Yes, his great eyes,” said my young lady attentively.  She had evidently\nheard all about his great eyes—the beaux yeux for which alone we had\nreally done it all.\n\n“They’re tragic and splendid—lights on a dangerous coast.  But he moves\nbadly and dresses worse, and altogether he’s anything but smart.”\n\nMy companion, who appeared to reflect on this, after a moment appealed.\n“Do you call him a real gentleman?”\n\nI started slightly at the question, for I had a sense of recognising it:\nGeorge Gravener, years before, that first flushed night, had put me face\nto face with it.  It had embarrassed me then, but it didn’t embarrass me\nnow, for I had lived with it and overcome it and disposed of it.  “A real\ngentleman?  Emphatically not!”\n\nMy promptitude surprised her a little, but I quickly felt how little it\nwas to Gravener I was now talking.  “Do you say that because he’s—what do\nyou call it in England?—of humble extraction?”\n\n“Not a bit.  His father was a country school-master and his mother the\nwidow of a sexton, but that has nothing to do with it.  I say it simply\nbecause I know him well.”\n\n“But isn’t it an awful drawback?”\n\n“Awful—quite awful.”\n\n“I mean isn’t it positively fatal?”\n\n“Fatal to what?  Not to his magnificent vitality.”\n\nAgain she had a meditative moment.  “And is his magnificent vitality the\ncause of his vices?”\n\n“Your questions are formidable, but I’m glad you put them.  I was\nthinking of his noble intellect.  His vices, as you say, have been much\nexaggerated: they consist mainly after all in one comprehensive defect.”\n\n“A want of will?”\n\n“A want of dignity.”\n\n“He doesn’t recognise his obligations?”\n\n“On the contrary, he recognises them with effusion, especially in public:\nhe smiles and bows and beckons across the street to them.  But when they\npass over he turns away, and he speedily loses them in the crowd.  The\nrecognition’s purely spiritual—it isn’t in the least social.  So he\nleaves all his belongings to other people to take care of.  He accepts\nfavours, loans, sacrifices—all with nothing more deterrent than an agony\nof shame.  Fortunately we’re a little faithful band, and we do what we\ncan.”  I held my tongue about the natural children, engendered, to the\nnumber of three, in the wantonness of his youth.  I only remarked that he\ndid make efforts—often tremendous ones.  “But the efforts,” I said,\n“never come to much: the only things that come to much are the\nabandonments, the surrenders.”\n\n“And how much do they come to?”\n\n“You’re right to put it as if we had a big bill to pay, but, as I’ve told\nyou before, your questions are rather terrible.  They come, these mere\nexercises of genius, to a great sum total of poetry, of philosophy, a\nmighty mass of speculation, notation, quotation.  The genius is there,\nyou see, to meet the surrender; but there’s no genius to support the\ndefence.”\n\n“But what is there, after all, at his age, to show?”\n\n“In the way of achievement recognised and reputation established?” I\nasked.  “To ‘show’ if you will, there isn’t much, since his writing,\nmostly, isn’t as fine, isn’t certainly as showy, as his talk.  Moreover\ntwo-thirds of his work are merely colossal projects and announcements.\n‘Showing’ Frank Saltram is often a poor business,” I went on: “we\nendeavoured, you’ll have observed, to show him to-night!  However, if he\nhad lectured he’d have lectured divinely.  It would just have been his\ntalk.”\n\n“And what would his talk just have been?”\n\nI was conscious of some ineffectiveness, as well perhaps as of a little\nimpatience, as I replied: “The exhibition of a splendid intellect.”  My\nyoung lady looked not quite satisfied at this, but as I wasn’t prepared\nfor another question I hastily pursued: “The sight of a great suspended\nswinging crystal—huge lucid lustrous, a block of light—flashing back\nevery impression of life and every possibility of thought!”\n\nThis gave her something to turn over till we had passed out to the dusky\nporch of the hall, in front of which the lamps of a quiet brougham were\nalmost the only thing Saltram’s treachery hadn’t extinguished.  I went\nwith her to the door of her carriage, out of which she leaned a moment\nafter she had thanked me and taken her seat.  Her smile even in the\ndarkness was pretty.  “I do want to see that crystal!”\n\n“You’ve only to come to the next lecture.”\n\n“I go abroad in a day or two with my aunt.”\n\n“Wait over till next week,” I suggested.  “It’s quite worth it.”\n\nShe became grave.  “Not unless he really comes!”  At which the brougham\nstarted off, carrying her away too fast, fortunately for my manners, to\nallow me to exclaim “Ingratitude!”\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM made a great affair of her right to be informed where her\nhusband had been the second evening he failed to meet his audience.  She\ncame to me to ascertain, but I couldn’t satisfy her, for in spite of my\ningenuity I remained in ignorance.  It wasn’t till much later that I\nfound this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the\nbest never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened\nto know the worst.  He had known it on the occasion I speak of—that is\nimmediately after.  He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed.\nWhat he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public.  It\nwas of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the\nengagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with\nregard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite\nirreproachable and insufferable person.  She often appeared at my\nchambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed\nher hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution,\nwhich she handed about for analysis.  She had arts of her own of exciting\none’s impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption\nthat we were kind to her because we liked her.  In reality her personal\nfall had been a sort of social rise—since I had seen the moment when, in\nour little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the\nfashion.  Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated\nthe good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved.  They were the people who\nby doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself;\nand the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a\npressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability.  I’m bound to\nsay he didn’t criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired\nof them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary\nforms.  She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by\ndependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society.\nShe pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she\ndoubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me.  I dare\nsay I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of\nimagination—if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard\nSaltram’s expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate\nsubjects of woe.  They were all flowers of his character, pearls strung\non an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging\nthem one after the other, as if she never suspected that he had a\ncharacter, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the\nirritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation.  One might\ndoubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for\nsuch a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one’s\nfeeling that there could be none for such a woman.\n\nI recognised her superiority when I asked her about the aunt of the\ndisappointed young lady: it sounded like a sentence from an\nEnglish-French or other phrase-book.  She triumphed in what she told me\nand she may have triumphed still more in what she withheld.  My friend of\nthe other evening, Miss Anvoy, had but lately come to England; Lady\nCoxon, the aunt, had been established here for years in consequence of\nher marriage with the late Sir Gregory of that name.  She had a house in\nthe Regent’s Park, a Bath-chair and a fernery; and above all she had\nsympathy.  Mrs. Saltram had made her acquaintance through mutual friends.\nThis vagueness caused me to feel how much I was out of it and how large\nan independent circle Mrs. Saltram had at her command.  I should have\nbeen glad to know more about the disappointed young lady, but I felt I\nshould know most by not depriving her of her advantage, as she might have\nmysterious means of depriving me of my knowledge.  For the present,\nmoreover, this experience was stayed, Lady Coxon having in fact gone\nabroad accompanied by her niece.  The niece, besides being immensely\nclever, was an heiress, Mrs. Saltram said; the only daughter and the\nlight of the eyes of some great American merchant, a man, over there, of\nendless indulgences and dollars.  She had pretty clothes and pretty\nmanners, and she had, what was prettier still, the great thing of all.\nThe great thing of all for Mrs. Saltram was always sympathy, and she\nspoke as if during the absence of these ladies she mightn’t know where to\nturn for it.  A few months later indeed, when they had come back, her\ntone perceptibly changed: she alluded to them, on my leading her up to\nit, rather as to persons in her debt for favours received.  What had\nhappened I didn’t know, but I saw it would take only a little more or a\nlittle less to make her speak of them as thankless subjects of social\ncountenance—people for whom she had vainly tried to do something.  I\nconfess I saw how it wouldn’t be in a mere week or two that I should rid\nmyself of the image of Ruth Anvoy, in whose very name, when I learnt it,\nI found something secretly to like.  I should probably neither see her\nnor hear of her again: the knight’s widow (he had been mayor of\nClockborough) would pass away and the heiress would return to her\ninheritance.  I gathered with surprise that she had not communicated to\nhis wife the story of her attempt to hear Mr..Saltram, and I founded this\nreticence on the easy supposition that Mrs. Saltram had fatigued by\noverpressure the spring of the sympathy of which she boasted.  The girl\nat any rate would forget the small adventure, be distracted, take a\nhusband; besides which she would lack occasion to repeat her experiment.\n\nWe clung to the idea of the brilliant course, delivered without an\naccident, that, as a lecturer, would still make the paying public aware\nof our great man, but the fact remained that in the case of an\ninspiration so unequal there was treachery, there was fallacy at least,\nin the very conception of a series.  In our scrutiny of ways and means we\nwere inevitably subject to the old convention of the synopsis, the\nsyllabus, partly of course not to lose the advantage of his grand free\nhand in drawing up such things; but for myself I laughed at our playbills\neven while I stickled for them.  It was indeed amusing work to be\nscrupulous for Frank Saltram, who also at moments laughed about it, so\nfar as the comfort of a sigh so unstudied as to be cheerful might pass\nfor such a sound.  He admitted with a candour all his own that he was in\ntruth only to be depended on in the Mulvilles’ drawing-room.  “Yes,” he\nsuggestively allowed, “it’s there, I think, that I’m at my best; quite\nlate, when it gets toward eleven—and if I’ve not been too much worried.”\nWe all knew what too much worry meant; it meant too enslaved for the hour\nto the superstition of sobriety.  On the Saturdays I used to bring my\nportmanteau, so as not to have to think of eleven o’clock trains.  I had\na bold theory that as regards this temple of talk and its altars of\ncushioned chintz, its pictures and its flowers, its large fireside and\nclear lamplight, we might really arrive at something if the Mulvilles\nwould but charge for admission.  Here it was, however, that they\nshamelessly broke down; as there’s a flaw in every perfection this was\nthe inexpugnable refuge of their egotism.  They declined to make their\nsaloon a market, so that Saltram’s golden words continued the sole coin\nthat rang there.  It can have happened to no man, however, to be paid a\ngreater price than such an enchanted hush as surrounded him on his\ngreatest nights.  The most profane, on these occasions, felt a presence;\nall minor eloquence grew dumb.  Adelaide Mulville, for the pride of her\nhospitality, anxiously watched the door or stealthily poked the fire.  I\nused to call it the music-room, for we had anticipated Bayreuth.  The\nvery gates of the kingdom of light seemed to open and the horizon of\nthought to flash with the beauty of a sunrise at sea.\n\nIn the consideration of ways and means, the sittings of our little board,\nwe were always conscious of the creak of Mrs. Saltram’s shoes.  She\nhovered, she interrupted, she almost presided, the state of affairs being\nmostly such as to supply her with every incentive for enquiring what was\nto be done next.  It was the pressing pursuit of this knowledge that, in\nconcatenations of omnibuses and usually in very wet weather, led her so\noften to my door.  She thought us spiritless creatures with editors and\npublishers; but she carried matters to no great effect when she\npersonally pushed into back-shops.  She wanted all moneys to be paid to\nherself: they were otherwise liable to such strange adventures.  They\ntrickled away into the desert—they were mainly at best, alas, a slender\nstream.  The editors and the publishers were the last people to take this\nremarkable thinker at the valuation that has now pretty well come to be\nestablished.  The former were half-distraught between the desire to “cut”\nhim and the difficulty of finding a crevice for their shears; and when a\nvolume on this or that portentous subject was proposed to the latter they\nsuggested alternative titles which, as reported to our friend, brought\ninto his face the noble blank melancholy that sometimes made it handsome.\nThe title of an unwritten book didn’t after all much matter, but some\nmasterpiece of Saltram’s may have died in his bosom of the shudder with\nwhich it was then convulsed.  The ideal solution, failing the fee at Kent\nMulville’s door, would have been some system of subscription to projected\ntreatises with their non-appearance provided for—provided for, I mean, by\nthe indulgence of subscribers.  The author’s real misfortune was that\nsubscribers were so wretchedly literal.  When they tastelessly enquired\nwhy publication hadn’t ensued I was tempted to ask who in the world had\never been so published.  Nature herself had brought him out in voluminous\nform, and the money was simply a deposit on borrowing the work.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI WAS doubtless often a nuisance to my friends in those years; but there\nwere sacrifices I declined to make, and I never passed the hat to George\nGravener.  I never forgot our little discussion in Ebury Street, and I\nthink it stuck in my throat to have to treat him to the avowal I had\nfound so easy to Mss Anvoy.  It had cost me nothing to confide to this\ncharming girl, but it would have cost me much to confide to the friend of\nmy youth, that the character of the “real gentleman” wasn’t an attribute\nof the man I took such pains for.  Was this because I had already\ngeneralised to the point of perceiving that women are really the\nunfastidious sex?  I knew at any rate that Gravener, already quite in\nview but still hungry and frugal, had naturally enough more ambition than\ncharity.  He had sharp aims for stray sovereigns, being in view most from\nthe tall steeple of Clockborough.  His immediate ambition was to occupy à\nlui seul the field of vision of that smokily-seeing city, and all his\nmovements and postures were calculated for the favouring angle.  The\nmovement of the hand as to the pocket had thus to alternate gracefully\nwith the posture of the hand on the heart.  He talked to Clockborough in\nshort only less beguilingly than Frank Saltram talked to his electors;\nwith the difference to our credit, however, that we had already voted and\nthat our candidate had no antagonist but himself.  He had more than once\nbeen at Wimbledon—it was Mrs. Mulville’s work not mine—and by the time\nthe claret was served had seen the god descend.  He took more pains to\nswing his censer than I had expected, but on our way back to town he\nforestalled any little triumph I might have been so artless as to express\nby the observation that such a man was—a hundred times!—a man to use and\nnever a man to be used by.  I remember that this neat remark humiliated\nme almost as much as if virtually, in the fever of broken slumbers, I\nhadn’t often made it myself.  The difference was that on Gravener’s part\na force attached to it that could never attach to it on mine.  He was\nable to use people—he had the machinery; and the irony of Saltram’s being\nmade showy at Clockborough came out to me when he said, as if he had no\nmemory of our original talk and the idea were quite fresh to him: “I hate\nhis type, you know, but I’ll be hanged if I don’t put some of those\nthings in.  I can find a place for them: we might even find a place for\nthe fellow himself.”  I myself should have had some fear—not, I need\nscarcely say, for the “things” themselves, but for some other things very\nnear them; in fine for the rest of my eloquence.\n\nLater on I could see that the oracle of Wimbledon was not in this case so\nappropriate as he would have been had the polities of the gods only\ncoincided more exactly with those of the party.  There was a distinct\nmoment when, without saying anything more definite to me, Gravener\nentertained the idea of annexing Mr. Saltram.  Such a project was\ndelusive, for the discovery of analogies between his body of doctrine and\nthat pressed from headquarters upon Clockborough—the bottling, in a word,\nof the air of those lungs for convenient public uncorking in\ncorn-exchanges—was an experiment for which no one had the leisure.  The\nonly thing would have been to carry him massively about, paid, caged,\nclipped; to turn him on for a particular occasion in a particular\nchannel.  Frank Saltram’s channel, however, was essentially not\ncalculable, and there was no knowing what disastrous floods might have\nensued.  For what there would have been to do The Empire, the great\nnewspaper, was there to look to; but it was no new misfortune that there\nwere delicate situations in which The Empire broke down.  In fine there\nwas an instinctive apprehension that a clever young journalist\ncommissioned to report on Mr. Saltram might never come back from the\nerrand.  No one knew better than George Gravener that that was a time\nwhen prompt returns counted double.  If he therefore found our friend an\nexasperating waste of orthodoxy it was because of his being, as he said,\npoor Gravener, up in the clouds, not because he was down in the dust.\nThe man would have been, just as he was, a real enough gentleman if he\ncould have helped to put in a real gentleman.  Gravener’s great objection\nto the actual member was that he was not one.\n\nLady Coxon had a fine old house, a house with “grounds,” at Clockborough,\nwhich she had let; but after she returned from abroad I learned from Mrs.\nSaltram that the lease had fallen in and that she had gone down to resume\npossession.  I could see the faded red livery, the big square shoulders,\nthe high-walled garden of this decent abode.  As the rumble of\ndissolution grew louder the suitor would have pressed his suit, and I\nfound myself hoping the politics of the late Mayor’s widow wouldn’t be\nsuch as to admonish her to ask him to dinner; perhaps indeed I went so\nfar as to pray, they would naturally form a bar to any contact.  I tried\nto focus the many-buttoned page, in the daily airing, as he perhaps even\npushed the Bath-chair over somebody’s toes.  I was destined to hear, none\nthe less, through Mrs. Saltram—who, I afterwards learned, was in\ncorrespondence with Lady Coxon’s housekeeper—that Gravener was known to\nhave spoken of the habitation I had in my eye as the pleasantest thing at\nClockborough.  On his part, I was sure, this was the voice not of envy\nbut of experience.  The vivid scene was now peopled, and I could see him\nin the old-time garden with Miss Anvoy, who would be certain, and very\njustly, to think him good-looking.  It would be too much to describe\nmyself as troubled by this play of surmise; but I occur to remember the\nrelief, singular enough, of feeling it suddenly brushed away by an\nannoyance really much greater; an annoyance the result of its happening\nto come over me about that time with a rush that I was simply ashamed of\nFrank Saltram.  There were limits after all, and my mark at last had been\nreached.\n\nI had had my disgusts, if I may allow myself to-day such an expression;\nbut this was a supreme revolt.  Certain things cleared up in my mind,\ncertain values stood out.  It was all very well to have an unfortunate\ntemperament; there was nothing so unfortunate as to have, for practical\npurposes, nothing else.  I avoided George Gravener at this moment and\nreflected that at such a time I should do so most effectually by leaving\nEngland.  I wanted to forget Frank Saltram—that was all.  I didn’t want\nto do anything in the world to him but that.  Indignation had withered on\nthe stalk, and I felt that one could pity him as much as one ought only\nby never thinking of him again.  It wasn’t for anything he had done to\nme; it was for what he had done to the Mulvilles.  Adelaide cried about\nit for a week, and her husband, profiting by the example so signally\ngiven him of the fatal effect of a want of character, left the letter,\nthe drop too much, unanswered.  The letter, an incredible one, addressed\nby Saltram to Wimbledon during a stay with the Pudneys at Ramsgate, was\nthe central feature of the incident, which, however, had many features,\neach more painful than whichever other we compared it with.  The Pudneys\nhad behaved shockingly, but that was no excuse.  Base ingratitude, gross\nindecency—one had one’s choice only of such formulas as that the more\nthey fitted the less they gave one rest.  These are dead aches now, and I\nam under no obligation, thank heaven, to be definite about the business.\nThere are things which if I had had to tell them—well, would have stopped\nme off here altogether.\n\nI went abroad for the general election, and if I don’t know how much, on\nthe Continent, I forgot, I at least know how much I missed, him.  At a\ndistance, in a foreign land, ignoring, abjuring, unlearning him, I\ndiscovered what he had done for me.  I owed him, oh unmistakeably,\ncertain noble conceptions; I had lighted my little taper at his smoky\nlamp, and lo it continued to twinkle.  But the light it gave me just\nshowed me how much more I wanted.  I was pursued of course by letters\nfrom Mrs. Saltram which I didn’t scruple not to read, though quite aware\nher embarrassments couldn’t but be now of the gravest.  I sacrificed to\npropriety by simply putting them away, and this is how, one day as my\nabsence drew to an end, my eye, while I rummaged in my desk for another\npaper, was caught by a name on a leaf that had detached itself from the\npacket.  The allusion was to Miss Anvoy, who, it appeared, was engaged to\nbe married to Mr. George Gravener; and the news was two months old.  A\ndirect question of Mrs. Saltram’s had thus remained unanswered—she had\nenquired of me in a postscript what sort of man this aspirant to such a\nhand might be.  The great other fact about him just then was that he had\nbeen triumphantly returned for Clockborough in the interest of the party\nthat had swept the country—so that I might easily have referred Mrs.\nSaltram to the journals of the day.  Yet when I at last wrote her that I\nwas coming home and would discharge my accumulated burden by seeing her,\nI but remarked in regard to her question that she must really put it to\nMiss Anvoy.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI HAD almost avoided the general election, but some of its consequences,\non my return, had smartly to be faced.  The season, in London, began to\nbreathe again and to flap its folded wings.  Confidence, under the new\nMinistry, was understood to be reviving, and one of the symptoms, in a\nsocial body, was a recovery of appetite.  People once more fed together,\nand it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody’s house, I fed with\nGeorge Gravener.  When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he\nsat and begged to congratulate him.  “On my election?” he asked after a\nmoment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that\ntriumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more\npersonal.  I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had\nmomentarily passed out of my mind.  What was present to it was that he\nwas to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious\nof some discomposure—I hadn’t intended to put this before everything.  He\nhimself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking\nthe whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what\nhe had won I had fixed my thoughts on his “seat.”  We straightened the\nmatter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him\nthat his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source.  He was\nso good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of\nMiss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town.  Lady\nCoxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed\ntheir arrival.  I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid\none; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said\n“Do you mean for her?”  When I had again explained what I meant he went\non: “Oh she’s an American, but you’d scarcely know it; unless, perhaps,”\nhe added, “by her being used to more money than most girls in England,\neven the daughters of rich men.  That wouldn’t in the least do for a\nfellow like me, you know, if it wasn’t for the great liberality of her\nfather.  He really has been most kind, and everything’s quite\nsatisfactory.”  He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous\nfancy to her and that during a recent visit at Coldfield she had nearly\nwon over Lady Maddock.  I gathered from something he dropped later on\nthat the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement,\nbut had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to,\nacross the water, for other favours.  People are simplified alike by\ngreat contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was\nGravener’s directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some\nturn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to\nask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt.  My\nenquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have\nin any contingency to act under her late husband’s will, which was odder\nstill, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with\nqueer loopholes.  There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old\nmaids, to whom she would have more or less to minister.  Gravener\nlaughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might\ncome in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning\na lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: “That’s all rot—one’s moved by\nother springs!”\n\nA fortnight later, at Lady Coxon’s own house, I understood well enough\nthe springs one was moved by.  Gravener had spoken of me there as an old\nfriend, and I received a gracious invitation to dine.  The Knight’s widow\nwas again indisposed—she had succumbed at the eleventh hour; so that I\nfound Miss Anvoy bravely playing hostess without even Gravener’s help,\nsince, to make matters worse, he had just sent up word that the House,\nthe insatiable House, with which he supposed he had contracted for easier\nterms, positively declined to release him.  I was struck with the\ncourage, the grace and gaiety of the young lady left thus to handle the\nfauna and flora of the Regent’s Park.  I did what I could to help her to\nclassify them, after I had recovered from the confusion of seeing her\nslightly disconcerted at perceiving in the guest introduced by her\nintended the gentleman with whom she had had that talk about Frank\nSaltram.  I had at this moment my first glimpse of the fact that she was\na person who could carry a responsibility; but I leave the reader to\njudge of my sense of the aggravation, for either of us, of such a burden,\nwhen I heard the servant announce Mrs. Saltram.  From what immediately\npassed between the two ladies I gathered that the latter had been sent\nfor post-haste to fill the gap created by the absence of the mistress of\nthe house.  “Good!” I remember crying, “she’ll be put by me;” and my\napprehension was promptly justified.  Mrs. Saltram taken in to dinner,\nand taken in as a consequence of an appeal to her amiability, was Mrs.\nSaltram with a vengeance.  I asked myself what Miss Anvoy meant by doing\nsuch things, but the only answer I arrived at was that Gravener was\nverily fortunate.  She hadn’t happened to tell him of her visit to Upper\nBaker Street, but she’d certainly tell him to-morrow; not indeed that\nthis would make him like any better her having had the innocence to\ninvite such a person as Mrs. Saltram on such an occasion.  It could only\nstrike me that I had never seen a young woman put such ignorance into her\ncleverness, such freedom into her modesty; this, I think, was when, after\ndinner, she said to me frankly, with almost jubilant mirth: “Oh you don’t\nadmire Mrs. Saltram?”  Why should I?  This was truly a young person\nwithout guile.  I had briefly to consider before I could reply that my\nobjection to the lady named was the objection often uttered about people\nmet at the social board—I knew all her stories.  Then as Miss Anvoy\nremained momentarily vague I added: “Those about her husband.”\n\n“Oh yes, but there are some new ones.”\n\n“None for me.  Ah novelty would be pleasant!”\n\n“Doesn’t it appear that of late he has been particularly horrid?”\n\n“His fluctuations don’t matter”, I returned, “for at night all cats are\ngrey.  You saw the shade of this one the night we waited for him\ntogether.  What will you have?  He has no dignity.”\n\nMiss Anvoy, who had been introducing with her American distinctness,\nlooked encouragingly round at some of the combinations she had risked.\n“It’s too bad I can’t see him.”\n\n“You mean Gravener won’t let you?”\n\n“I haven’t asked him.  He lets me do everything.”\n\n“But you know he knows him and wonders what some of us see in him.”\n\n“We haven’t happened to talk of him,” the girl said.\n\n“Get him to take you some day out to see the Mulvilles.”\n\n“I thought Mr. Saltram had thrown the Mulvilles over.”\n\n“Utterly.  But that won’t prevent his being planted there again, to bloom\nlike a rose, within a month or two.”\n\nMiss Anvoy thought a moment.  Then, “I should like to see them,” she said\nwith her fostering smile.\n\n“They’re tremendously worth it.  You mustn’t miss them.”\n\n“I’ll make George take me,” she went on as Mrs. Saltram came up to\ninterrupt us.  She sniffed at this unfortunate as kindly as she had\nsmiled at me and, addressing the question to her, continued: “But the\nchance of a lecture—one of the wonderful lectures?  Isn’t there another\ncourse announced?”\n\n“Another?  There are about thirty!” I exclaimed, turning away and feeling\nMrs. Saltram’s little eyes in my back.  A few days after this I heard\nthat Gravener’s marriage was near at hand—was settled for Whitsuntide;\nbut as no invitation had reached me I had my doubts, and there presently\ncame to me in fact the report of a postponement.  Something was the\nmatter; what was the matter was supposed to be that Lady Coxon was now\ncritically ill.  I had called on her after my dinner in the Regent’s\nPark, but I had neither seen her nor seen Miss Anvoy.  I forget to-day\nthe exact order in which, at this period, sundry incidents occurred and\nthe particular stage at which it suddenly struck me, making me catch my\nbreath a little, that the progression, the acceleration, was for all the\nworld that of fine drama.  This was probably rather late in the day, and\nthe exact order doesn’t signify.  What had already occurred was some\naccident determining a more patient wait.  George Gravener, whom I met\nagain, in fact told me as much, but without signs of perturbation.  Lady\nCoxon had to be constantly attended to, and there were other good reasons\nas well.  Lady Coxon had to be so constantly attended to that on the\noccasion of a second attempt in the Regent’s Park I equally failed to\nobtain a sight of her niece.  I judged it discreet in all the conditions\nnot to make a third; but this didn’t matter, for it was through Adelaide\nMulville that the side-wind of the comedy, though I was at first\nunwitting, began to reach me.  I went to Wimbledon at times because\nSaltram was there, and I went at others because he wasn’t.  The Pudneys,\nwho had taken him to Birmingham, had already got rid of him, and we had a\nhorrible consciousness of his wandering roofless, in dishonour, about the\nsmoky Midlands, almost as the injured Lear wandered on the storm-lashed\nheath.  His room, upstairs, had been lately done up (I could hear the\ncrackle of the new chintz) and the difference only made his smirches and\nbruises, his splendid tainted genius, the more tragic.  If he wasn’t\nbarefoot in the mire he was sure to be unconventionally shod.  These were\nthe things Adelaide and I, who were old enough friends to stare at each\nother in silence, talked about when we didn’t speak.  When we spoke it\nwas only about the brilliant girl George Gravener was to marry and whom\nhe had brought out the other Sunday.  I could see that this presentation\nhad been happy, for Mrs. Mulville commemorated it after her sole fashion\nof showing confidence in a new relation.  “She likes me—she likes me”:\nher native humility exulted in that measure of success.  We all knew for\nourselves how she liked those who liked her, and as regards Ruth Anvoy\nshe was more easily won over than Lady Maddock.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nONE of the consequences, for the Mulvilles, of the sacrifices they made\nfor Frank Saltram was that they had to give up their carriage.  Adelaide\ndrove gently into London in a one-horse greenish thing, an early\nVictorian landau, hired, near at hand, imaginatively, from a broken-down\njobmaster whose wife was in consumption—a vehicle that made people turn\nround all the more when her pensioner sat beside her in a soft white hat\nand a shawl, one of the dear woman’s own.  This was his position and I\ndare say his costume when on an afternoon in July she went to return Miss\nAnvoy’s visit.  The wheel of fate had now revolved, and amid silences\ndeep and exhaustive, compunctions and condonations alike unutterable,\nSaltram was reinstated.  Was it in pride or in penance that Mrs. Mulville\nhad begun immediately to drive him about?  If he was ashamed of his\ningratitude she might have been ashamed of her forgiveness; but she was\nincorrigibly capable of liking him to be conspicuous in the landau while\nshe was in shops or with her acquaintance.  However, if he was in the\npillory for twenty minutes in the Regent’s Park—I mean at Lady Coxon’s\ndoor while his companion paid her call—it wasn’t to the further\nhumiliation of any one concerned that she presently came out for him in\nperson, not even to show either of them what a fool she was that she drew\nhim in to be introduced to the bright young American.  Her account of the\nintroduction I had in its order, but before that, very late in the\nseason, under Gravener’s auspices, I met Miss Anvoy at tea at the House\nof Commons.  The member for Clockborough had gathered a group of pretty\nladies, and the Mulvilles were not of the party.  On the great terrace,\nas I strolled off with her a little, the guest of honour immediately\nexclaimed to me: “I’ve seen him, you know—I’ve seen him!”  She told me\nabout Saltram’s call.\n\n“And how did you find him?”\n\n“Oh so strange!”\n\n“You didn’t like him?”\n\n“I can’t tell till I see him again.”\n\n“You want to do that?”\n\nShe had a pause.  “Immensely.”\n\nWe went no further; I fancied she had become aware Gravener was looking\nat us.  She turned back toward the knot of the others, and I said:\n“Dislike him as much as you will—I see you’re bitten.”\n\n“Bitten?”  I thought she coloured a little.\n\n“Oh it doesn’t matter!” I laughed; “one doesn’t die of it.”\n\n“I hope I shan’t die of anything before I’ve seen more of Mrs. Mulville.”\nI rejoiced with her over plain Adelaide, whom she pronounced the\nloveliest woman she had met in England; but before we separated I\nremarked to her that it was an act of mere humanity to warn her that if\nshe should see more of Frank Saltram—which would be likely to follow on\nany increase of acquaintance with Mrs. Mulville—she might find herself\nflattening her nose against the clear hard pane of an eternal\nquestion—that of the relative, that of the opposed, importances of virtue\nand brains.  She replied that this was surely a subject on which one took\neverything for granted; whereupon I admitted that I had perhaps expressed\nmyself ill.  What I referred to was what I had referred to the night we\nmet in Upper Baker Street—the relative importance (relative to virtue) of\nother gifts.  She asked me if I called virtue a gift—a thing handed to us\nin a parcel on our first birthday; and I declared that this very enquiry\nproved to me the problem had already caught her by the skirt.  She would\nhave help however, the same help I myself had once had, in resisting its\ntendency to make one cross.\n\n“What help do you mean?”\n\n“That of the member for Clockborough.”\n\nShe stared, smiled, then returned: “Why my idea has been to help him!”\n\nShe had helped him—I had his own word for it that at Clockborough her\nbedevilment of the voters had really put him in.  She would do so\ndoubtless again and again, though I heard the very next month that this\nfine faculty had undergone a temporary eclipse.  News of the catastrophe\nfirst came to me from Mrs. Saltram, and it was afterwards confirmed at\nWimbledon: poor Miss Anvoy was in trouble—great disasters in America had\nsuddenly summoned her home.  Her father, in New York, had suffered\nreverses, lost so much money that it was really vexatious as showing how\nmuch he had had.  It was Adelaide who told me she had gone off alone at\nless than a week’s notice.\n\n“Alone?  Gravener has permitted that?”\n\n“What will you have?  The House of Commons!”\n\nI’m afraid I cursed the House of Commons: I was so much interested.  Of\ncourse he’d follow her as soon as he was free to make her his wife; only\nshe mightn’t now be able to bring him anything like the marriage-portion\nof which he had begun by having the virtual promise.  Mrs. Mulville let\nme know what was already said: she was charming, this American girl, but\nreally these American fathers—!  What was a man to do?  Mr. Saltram,\naccording to Mrs. Mulville, was of opinion that a man was never to suffer\nhis relation to money to become a spiritual relation—he was to keep it\nexclusively material.  “Moi pas comprendre!” I commented on this; in\nrejoinder to which Adelaide, with her beautiful sympathy, explained that\nshe supposed he simply meant that the thing was to use it, don’t you\nknow? but not to think too much about it.  “To take it, but not to thank\nyou for it?” I still more profanely enquired.  For a quarter of an hour\nafterwards she wouldn’t look at me, but this didn’t prevent my asking her\nwhat had been the result, that afternoon—in the Regent’s Park, of her\ntaking our friend to see Miss Anvoy.\n\n“Oh so charming!” she answered, brightening.  “He said he recognised in\nher a nature he could absolutely trust.”\n\n“Yes, but I’m speaking of the effect on herself.”\n\nMrs. Mulville had to remount the stream.  “It was everything one could\nwish.”\n\nSomething in her tone made me laugh.  “Do you mean she gave him—a dole?”\n\n“Well, since you ask me!”\n\n“Right there on the spot?”\n\nAgain poor Adelaide faltered.  “It was to me of course she gave it.”\n\nI stared; somehow I couldn’t see the scene.  “Do you mean a sum of\nmoney?”\n\n“It was very handsome.”  Now at last she met my eyes, though I could see\nit was with an effort.  “Thirty pounds.”\n\n“Straight out of her pocket?”\n\n“Out of the drawer of a table at which she had been writing.  She just\nslipped the folded notes into my hand.  He wasn’t looking; it was while\nhe was going back to the carriage.”  “Oh,” said Adelaide reassuringly, “I\ntake care of it for him!”  The dear practical soul thought my agitation,\nfor I confess I was agitated, referred to the employment of the money.\nHer disclosure made me for a moment muse violently, and I dare say that\nduring that moment I wondered if anything else in the world makes people\nso gross as unselfishness.  I uttered, I suppose, some vague synthetic\ncry, for she went on as if she had had a glimpse of my inward amaze at\nsuch passages.  “I assure you, my dear friend, he was in one of his happy\nhours.”\n\nBut I wasn’t thinking of that.  “Truly indeed these Americans!” I said.\n“With her father in the very act, as it were, of swindling her\nbetrothed!”\n\nMrs. Mulville stared.  “Oh I suppose Mr. Anvoy has scarcely gone\nbankrupt—or whatever he has done—on purpose.  Very likely they won’t be\nable to keep it up, but there it was, and it was a very beautiful\nimpulse.”\n\n“You say Saltram was very fine?”\n\n“Beyond everything.  He surprised even me.”\n\n“And I know what you’ve enjoyed.”  After a moment I added: “Had he\nperadventure caught a glimpse of the money in the table-drawer?”\n\nAt this my companion honestly flushed.  “How can you be so cruel when you\nknow how little he calculates?”\n\n“Forgive me, I do know it.  But you tell me things that act on my nerves.\nI’m sure he hadn’t caught a glimpse of anything but some splendid idea.”\n\nMrs. Mulville brightly concurred.  “And perhaps even of her beautiful\nlistening face.”\n\n“Perhaps even!  And what was it all about?”\n\n“His talk?  It was apropos of her engagement, which I had told him about:\nthe idea of marriage, the philosophy, the poetry, the sublimity of it.”\nIt was impossible wholly to restrain one’s mirth at this, and some rude\nripple that I emitted again caused my companion to admonish me.  “It\nsounds a little stale, but you know his freshness.”\n\n“Of illustration?  Indeed I do!”\n\n“And how he has always been right on that great question.”\n\n“On what great question, dear lady, hasn’t he been right?”\n\n“Of what other great men can you equally say it?—and that he has never,\nbut never, had a deflexion?” Mrs. Mulville exultantly demanded.\n\nI tried to think of some other great man, but I had to give it up.\n“Didn’t Miss Anvoy express her satisfaction in any less diffident way\nthan by her charming present?” I was reduced to asking instead.\n\n“Oh yes, she overflowed to me on the steps while he was getting into the\ncarriage.”  These words somehow brushed up a picture of Saltram’s big\nshawled back as he hoisted himself into the green landau.  “She said she\nwasn’t disappointed,” Adelaide pursued.\n\nI turned it over.  “Did he wear his shawl?”\n\n“His shawl?”  She hadn’t even noticed.\n\n“I mean yours.”\n\n“He looked very nice, and you know he’s really clean.  Miss Anvoy used\nsuch a remarkable expression—she said his mind’s like a crystal!”\n\nI pricked up my ears.  “A crystal?”\n\n“Suspended in the moral world—swinging and shining and flashing there.\nShe’s monstrously clever, you know.”\n\nI thought again.  “Monstrously!”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGEORGE GRAVENER didn’t follow her, for late in September, after the House\nhad risen, I met him in a railway-carriage.  He was coming up from\nScotland and I had just quitted some relations who lived near Durham.\nThe current of travel back to London wasn’t yet strong; at any rate on\nentering the compartment I found he had had it for some time to himself.\nWe fared in company, and though he had a blue-book in his lap and the\nopen jaws of his bag threatened me with the white teeth of confused\npapers, we inevitably, we even at last sociably conversed.  I saw things\nweren’t well with him, but I asked no question till something dropped by\nhimself made, as it had made on another occasion, an absence of curiosity\ninvidious.  He mentioned that he was worried about his good old friend\nLady Coxon, who, with her niece likely to be detained some time in\nAmerica, lay seriously ill at Clockborough, much on his mind and on his\nhands.\n\n“Ah Miss Anvoy’s in America?”\n\n“Her father has got into horrid straits—has lost no end of money.”\n\nI waited, after expressing due concern, but I eventually said: “I hope\nthat raises no objection to your marriage.”\n\n“None whatever; moreover it’s my trade to meet objections.  But it may\ncreate tiresome delays, of which there have been too many, from various\ncauses, already.  Lady Coxon got very bad, then she got much better.\nThen Mr. Anvoy suddenly began to totter, and now he seems quite on his\nback.  I’m afraid he’s really in for some big reverse.  Lady Coxon’s\nworse again, awfully upset by the news from America, and she sends me\nword that she _must_ have Ruth.  How can I supply her with Ruth?  I\nhaven’t got Ruth myself!”\n\n“Surely you haven’t lost her?” I returned.\n\n“She’s everything to her wretched father.  She writes me every\npost—telling me to smooth her aunt’s pillow.  I’ve other things to\nsmooth; but the old lady, save for her servants, is really alone.  She\nwon’t receive her Coxon relations—she’s angry at so much of her money\ngoing to them.  Besides, she’s hopelessly mad,” said Gravener very\nfrankly.\n\nI don’t remember whether it was this, or what it was, that made me ask if\nshe hadn’t such an appreciation of Mrs. Saltram as might render that\nactive person of some use.\n\nHe gave me a cold glance, wanting to know what had put Mrs. Saltram into\nmy head, and I replied that she was unfortunately never out of it.  I\nhappened to remember the wonderful accounts she had given me of the\nkindness Lady Coxon had shown her.  Gravener declared this to be false;\nLady Coxon, who didn’t care for her, hadn’t seen her three times.  The\nonly foundation for it was that Miss Anvoy, who used, poor girl, to chuck\nmoney about in a manner she must now regret, had for an hour seen in the\nmiserable woman—you could never know what she’d see in people—an\ninteresting pretext for the liberality with which her nature overflowed.\nBut even Miss Anvoy was now quite tired of her.  Gravener told me more\nabout the crash in New York and the annoyance it had been to him, and we\nalso glanced here and there in other directions; but by the time we got\nto Doncaster the principal thing he had let me see was that he was\nkeeping something back.  We stopped at that station, and, at the\ncarriage-door, some one made a movement to get in.  Gravener uttered a\nsound of impatience, and I felt sure that but for this I should have had\nthe secret.  Then the intruder, for some reason, spared us his company;\nwe started afresh, and my hope of a disclosure returned.  My companion\nheld his tongue, however, and I pretended to go to sleep; in fact I\nreally dozed for discouragement.  When I reopened my eyes he was looking\nat me with an injured air.  He tossed away with some vivacity the remnant\nof a cigarette and then said: “If you’re not too sleepy I want to put you\na case.”  I answered that I’d make every effort to attend, and welcomed\nthe note of interest when he went on: “As I told you a while ago, Lady\nCoxon, poor dear, is demented.”  His tone had much behind it—was full of\npromise.  I asked if her ladyship’s misfortune were a trait of her malady\nor only of her character, and he pronounced it a product of both.  The\ncase he wanted to put to me was a matter on which it concerned him to\nhave the impression—the judgement, he might also say—of another person.\n“I mean of the average intelligent man, but you see I take what I can\nget.” There would be the technical, the strictly legal view; then there\nwould be the way the question would strike a man of the world.  He had\nlighted another cigarette while he talked, and I saw he was glad to have\nit to handle when he brought out at last, with a laugh slightly\nartificial: “In fact it’s a subject on which Miss Anvoy and I are pulling\ndifferent ways.”\n\n“And you want me to decide between you?  I decide in advance for Miss\nAnvoy.”\n\n“In advance—that’s quite right.  That’s how I decided when I proposed to\nher.  But my story will interest you only so far as your mind isn’t made\nup.”  Gravener puffed his cigarette a minute and then continued: “Are you\nfamiliar with the idea of the Endowment of Research?”\n\n“Of Research?” I was at sea a moment.\n\n“I give you Lady Coxon’s phrase.  She has it on the brain.”\n\n“She wishes to endow—?”\n\n“Some earnest and ‘loyal’ seeker,” Gravener said.  “It was a sketchy\ndesign of her late husband’s, and he handed it on to her; setting apart\nin his will a sum of money of which she was to enjoy the interest for\nlife, but of which, should she eventually see her opportunity—the matter\nwas left largely to her discretion—she would best honour his memory by\ndetermining the exemplary public use.  This sum of money, no less than\nthirteen thousand pounds, was to be called The Coxon Fund; and poor Sir\nGregory evidently proposed to himself that The Coxon Fund should cover\nhis name with glory—be universally desired and admired.  He left his wife\na full declaration of his views, so far at least as that term may be\napplied to views vitiated by a vagueness really infantine.  A little\nlearning’s a dangerous thing, and a good citizen who happens to have been\nan ass is worse for a community than bad sewerage.  He’s worst of all\nwhen he’s dead, because then he can’t be stopped.  However, such as they\nwere, the poor man’s aspirations are now in his wife’s bosom, or\nfermenting rather in her foolish brain: it lies with her to carry them\nout.  But of course she must first catch her hare.”\n\n“Her earnest loyal seeker?”\n\n“The flower that blushes unseen for want of such a pecuniary independence\nas may aid the light that’s in it to shine upon the human race.  The\nindividual, in a word, who, having the rest of the machinery, the\nspiritual, the intellectual, is most hampered in his search.”\n\n“His search for what?”\n\n“For Moral Truth.  That’s what Sir Gregory calls it.”\n\nI burst out laughing.  “Delightful munificent Sir Gregory!  It’s a\ncharming idea.”\n\n“So Miss Anvoy thinks.”\n\n“Has she a candidate for the Fund?”\n\n“Not that I know of—and she’s perfectly reasonable about it.  But Lady\nCoxon has put the matter before her, and we’ve naturally had a lot of\ntalk.”\n\n“Talk that, as you’ve so interestingly intimated, has landed you in a\ndisagreement.”\n\n“She considers there’s something in it,” Gravener said.\n\n“And you consider there’s nothing?”\n\n“It seems to me a piece of solemn twaddle—which can’t fail to be attended\nwith consequences certainly grotesque and possibly immoral.  To begin\nwith, fancy constituting an endowment without establishing a tribunal—a\nbench of competent people, of judges.”\n\n“The sole tribunal is Lady Coxon?”\n\n“And any one she chooses to invite.”\n\n“But she has invited you,” I noted.\n\n“I’m not competent—I hate the thing.  Besides, she hasn’t,” my friend\nwent on.  “The real history of the matter, I take it, is that the\ninspiration was originally Lady Coxon’s own, that she infected him with\nit, and that the flattering option left her is simply his tribute to her\nbeautiful, her aboriginal enthusiasm.  She came to England forty years\nago, a thin transcendental Bostonian, and even her odd happy frumpy\nClockborough marriage never really materialised her.  She feels indeed\nthat she has become very British—as if that, as a process, as a ‘Werden,’\nas anything but an original sign of grace, were conceivable; but it’s\nprecisely what makes her cling to the notion of the ‘Fund’—cling to it as\nto a link with the ideal.”\n\n“How can she cling if she’s dying?”\n\n“Do you mean how can she act in the matter?” Gravener asked.  “That’s\nprecisely the question.  She can’t!  As she has never yet caught her\nhare, never spied out her lucky impostor—how should she, with the life\nshe has led?—her husband’s intention has come very near lapsing.  His\nidea, to do him justice, was that it _should_ lapse if exactly the right\nperson, the perfect mixture of genius and chill penury, should fail to\nturn up.  Ah the poor dear woman’s very particular—she says there must be\nno mistake.”\n\nI found all this quite thrilling—I took it in with avidity.  “And if she\ndies without doing anything, what becomes of the money?” I demanded.\n\n“It goes back to his family, if she hasn’t made some other disposition of\nit.”\n\n“She may do that then—she may divert it?”\n\n“Her hands are not tied.  She has a grand discretion.  The proof is that\nthree months ago she offered to make the proceeds over to her niece.”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use?”\n\n“For Miss Anvoy’s own use—on the occasion of her prospective marriage.\nShe was discouraged—the earnest seeker required so earnest a search.  She\nwas afraid of making a mistake; every one she could think of seemed\neither not earnest enough or not poor enough.  On the receipt of the\nfirst bad news about Mr. Anvoy’s affairs she proposed to Ruth to make the\nsacrifice for her.  As the situation in New York got worse she repeated\nher proposal.”\n\n“Which Miss Anvoy declined?”\n\n“Except as a formal trust.”\n\n“You mean except as committing herself legally to place the money?”\n\n“On the head of the deserving object, the great man frustrated,” said\nGravener.  “She only consents to act in the spirit of Sir Gregory’s\nscheme.”\n\n“And you blame her for that?” I asked with some intensity.\n\nMy tone couldn’t have been harsh, but he coloured a little and there was\na queer light in his eye.  “My dear fellow, if I ‘blamed’ the young lady\nI’m engaged to I shouldn’t immediately say it even to so old a friend as\nyou.”  I saw that some deep discomfort, some restless desire to be sided\nwith, reassuringly, approvingly mirrored, had been at the bottom of his\ndrifting so far, and I was genuinely touched by his confidence.  It was\ninconsistent with his habits; but being troubled about a woman was not,\nfor him, a habit: that itself was an inconsistency.  George Gravener\ncould stand straight enough before any other combination of forces.  It\namused me to think that the combination he had succumbed to had an\nAmerican accent, a transcendental aunt and an insolvent father; but all\nmy old loyalty to him mustered to meet this unexpected hint that I could\nhelp him.  I saw that I could from the insincere tone in which he\npursued: “I’ve criticised her of course, I’ve contended with her, and it\nhas been great fun.”  Yet it clearly couldn’t have been such great fun as\nto make it improper for me presently to ask if Miss Anvoy had nothing at\nall settled on herself.  To this he replied that she had only a trifle\nfrom her mother—a mere four hundred a year, which was exactly why it\nwould be convenient to him that she shouldn’t decline, in the face of\nthis total change in her prospects, an accession of income which would\ndistinctly help them to marry.  When I enquired if there were no other\nway in which so rich and so affectionate an aunt could cause the weight\nof her benevolence to be felt, he answered that Lady Coxon was\naffectionate indeed, but was scarcely to be called rich.  She could let\nher project of the Fund lapse for her niece’s benefit, but she couldn’t\ndo anything else.  She had been accustomed to regard her as tremendously\nprovided for, and she was up to her eyes in promises to anxious Coxons.\nShe was a woman of an inordinate conscience, and her conscience was now a\ndistress to her, hovering round her bed in irreconcilable forms of\nresentful husbands, portionless nieces and undiscoverable philosophers.\n\nWe were by this time getting into the whirr of fleeting platforms, the\nmultiplication of lights.  “I think you’ll find,” I said with a laugh,\n“that your predicament will disappear in the very fact that the\nphilosopher _is_ undiscoverable.”\n\nHe began to gather up his papers.  “Who can set a limit to the ingenuity\nof an extravagant woman?”\n\n“Yes, after all, who indeed?” I echoed as I recalled the extravagance\ncommemorated in Adelaide’s anecdote of Miss Anvoy and the thirty pounds.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nTHE thing I had been most sensible of in that talk with George Gravener\nwas the way Saltram’s name kept out of it.  It seemed to me at the time\nthat we were quite pointedly silent about him; but afterwards it appeared\nmore probable there had been on my companion’s part no conscious\navoidance.  Later on I was sure of this, and for the best of reasons—the\nsimple reason of my perceiving more completely that, for evil as well as\nfor good, he said nothing to Gravener’s imagination.  That honest man\ndidn’t fear him—he was too much disgusted with him.  No more did I,\ndoubtless, and for very much the same reason.  I treated my friend’s\nstory as an absolute confidence; but when before Christmas, by Mrs.\nSaltram, I was informed of Lady Coxon’s death without having had news of\nMiss Anvoy’s return, I found myself taking for granted we should hear no\nmore of these nuptials, in which, as obscurely unnatural, I now saw I had\nnever _too_ disconcertedly believed.  I began to ask myself how people\nwho suited each other so little could please each other so much.  The\ncharm was some material charm, some afffinity, exquisite doubtless, yet\nsuperficial some surrender to youth and beauty and passion, to force and\ngrace and fortune, happy accidents and easy contacts.  They might dote on\neach other’s persons, but how could they know each other’s souls?  How\ncould they have the same prejudices, how could they have the same\nhorizon?  Such questions, I confess, seemed quenched but not answered\nwhen, one day in February, going out to Wimbledon, I found our young lady\nin the house.  A passion that had brought her back across the wintry\nocean was as much of a passion as was needed.  No impulse equally strong\nindeed had drawn George Gravener to America; a circumstance on which,\nhowever, I reflected only long enough to remind myself that it was none\nof my business.  Ruth Anvoy was distinctly different, and I felt that the\ndifference was not simply that of her marks of mourning.  Mrs. Mulville\ntold me soon enough what it was: it was the difference between a handsome\ngirl with large expectations and a handsome girl with only four hundred a\nyear.  This explanation indeed didn’t wholly content me, not even when I\nlearned that her mourning had a double cause—learned that poor Mr. Anvoy,\ngiving way altogether, buried under the ruins of his fortune and leaving\nnext to nothing, had died a few weeks before.\n\n“So she has come out to marry George Gravener?” I commented.  “Wouldn’t\nit have been prettier of him to have saved her the trouble?”\n\n“Hasn’t the House just met?” Adelaide replied.  “And for Mr. Gravener the\nHouse—!”  Then she added: “I gather that her having come is exactly a\nsign that the marriage is a little shaky.  If it were quite all right a\nself-respecting girl like Ruth would have waited for him over there.”\n\nI noted that they were already Ruth and Adelaide, but what I said was:\n“Do you mean she’ll have had to return to _make_ it so?”\n\n“No, I mean that she must have come out for some reason independent of\nit.”  Adelaide could only surmise, however, as yet, and there was more,\nas we found, to be revealed.  Mrs. Mulville, on hearing of her arrival,\nhad brought the young lady out in the green landau for the Sunday.  The\nCoxons were in possession of the house in Regent’s Park, and Miss Anvoy\nwas in dreary lodgings.  George Gravener had been with her when Adelaide\ncalled, but had assented graciously enough to the little visit at\nWimbledon.  The carriage, with Mr. Saltram in it but not mentioned, had\nbeen sent off on some errand from which it was to return and pick the\nladies up.  Gravener had left them together, and at the end of an hour,\non the Saturday afternoon, the party of three had driven out to\nWimbledon.  This was the girl’s second glimpse of our great man, and I\nwas interested in asking Mrs. Mulville if the impression made by the\nfirst appeared to have been confirmed.  On her replying after\nconsideration, that of course with time and opportunity it couldn’t fail\nto be, but that she was disappointed, I was sufficiently struck with her\nuse of this last word to question her further.\n\n“Do you mean you’re disappointed because you judge Miss Anvoy to be?”\n\n“Yes; I hoped for a greater effect last evening.  We had two or three\npeople, but he scarcely opened his mouth.”\n\n“He’ll be all the better to-night,” I opined after a moment.  Then I\npursued: “What particular importance do you attach to the idea of her\nbeing impressed?”\n\nAdelaide turned her mild pale eyes on me as for rebuke of my levity.\n“Why the importance of her being as happy as _we_ are!”\n\nI’m afraid that at this my levity grew.  “Oh that’s a happiness almost\ntoo great to wish a person!”  I saw she hadn’t yet in her mind what I had\nin mine, and at any rate the visitor’s actual bliss was limited to a walk\nin the garden with Kent Mulville.  Later in the afternoon I also took\none, and I saw nothing of Miss Anvoy till dinner, at which we failed of\nthe company of Saltram, who had caused it to be reported that he was\nindisposed and lying down.  This made us, most of us—for there were other\nfriends present—convey to each other in silence some of the unutterable\nthings that in those years our eyes had inevitably acquired the art of\nexpressing.  If a fine little American enquirer hadn’t been there we\nwould have expressed them otherwise, and Adelaide would have pretended\nnot to hear.  I had seen her, before the very fact, abstract herself\nnobly; and I knew that more than once, to keep it from the servants,\nmanaging, dissimulating cleverly, she had helped her husband to carry him\nbodily to his room.  Just recently he had been so wise and so deep and so\nhigh that I had begun to get nervous—to wonder if by chance there were\nsomething behind it, if he were kept straight for instance by the\nknowledge that the hated Pudneys would have more to tell us if they\nchose.  He was lying low, but unfortunately it was common wisdom with us\nin this connexion that the biggest splashes took place in the quietest\npools.  We should have had a merry life indeed if all the splashes had\nsprinkled us as refreshingly as the waters we were even then to feel\nabout our ears.  Kent Mulville had been up to his room, but had come back\nwith a face that told as few tales as I had seen it succeed in telling on\nthe evening I waited in the lecture-room with Miss Anvoy.  I said to\nmyself that our friend had gone out, but it was a comfort that the\npresence of a comparative stranger deprived us of the dreary duty of\nsuggesting to each other, in respect of his errand, edifying\npossibilities in which we didn’t ourselves believe.  At ten o’clock he\ncame into the drawing-room with his waistcoat much awry but his eyes\nsending out great signals.  It was precisely with his entrance that I\nceased to be vividly conscious of him.  I saw that the crystal, as I had\ncalled it, had begun to swing, and I had need of my immediate attention\nfor Miss Anvoy.\n\nEven when I was told afterwards that he had, as we might have said\nto-day, broken the record, the manner in which that attention had been\nrewarded relieved me of a sense of loss.  I had of course a perfect\ngeneral consciousness that something great was going on: it was a little\nlike having been etherised to hear Herr Joachim play.  The old music was\nin the air; I felt the strong pulse of thought, the sink and swell, the\nflight, the poise, the plunge; but I knew something about one of the\nlisteners that nobody else knew, and Saltram’s monologue could reach me\nonly through that medium.  To this hour I’m of no use when, as a witness,\nI’m appealed to—for they still absurdly contend about it—as to whether or\nno on that historic night he was drunk; and my position is slightly\nridiculous, for I’ve never cared to tell them what it really was I was\ntaken up with.  What I got out of it is the only morsel of the total\nexperience that is quite my own.  The others were shared, but this is\nincommunicable.  I feel that now, I’m bound to say, even in thus roughly\nevoking the occasion, and it takes something from my pride of clearness.\nHowever, I shall perhaps be as clear as is absolutely needful if I remark\nthat our young lady was too much given up to her own intensity of\nobservation to be sensible of mine.  It was plainly not the question of\nher marriage that had brought her back.  I greatly enjoyed this discovery\nand was sure that had that question alone been involved she would have\nstirred no step.  In this case doubtless Gravener would, in spite of the\nHouse of Commons, have found means to rejoin her.  It afterwards made me\nuncomfortable for her that, alone in the lodging Mrs. Mulville had put\nbefore me as dreary, she should have in any degree the air of waiting for\nher fate; so that I was presently relieved at hearing of her having gone\nto stay at Coldfield.  If she was in England at all while the engagement\nstood the only proper place for her was under Lady Maddock’s wing.  Now\nthat she was unfortunate and relatively poor, perhaps her prospective\nsister-in-law would be wholly won over.\n\nThere would be much to say, if I had space, about the way her behaviour,\nas I caught gleams of it, ministered to the image that had taken birth in\nmy mind, to my private amusement, while that other night I listened to\nGeorge Gravener in the railway-carriage.  I watched her in the light of\nthis queer possibility—a formidable thing certainly to meet—and I was\naware that it coloured, extravagantly perhaps, my interpretation of her\nvery looks and tones.  At Wimbledon for instance it had appeared to me\nshe was literally afraid of Saltram, in dread of a coercion that she had\nbegun already to feel.  I had come up to town with her the next day and\nhad been convinced that, though deeply interested, she was immensely on\nher guard.  She would show as little as possible before she should be\nready to show everything.  What this final exhibition might be on the\npart of a girl perceptibly so able to think things out I found it great\nsport to forecast.  It would have been exciting to be approached by her,\nappealed to by her for advice; but I prayed to heaven I mightn’t find\nmyself in such a predicament.  If there was really a present rigour in\nthe situation of which Gravener had sketched for me the elements, she\nwould have to get out of her difficulty by herself.  It wasn’t I who had\nlaunched her and it wasn’t I who could help her.  I didn’t fail to ask\nmyself why, since I couldn’t help her, I should think so much about her.\nIt was in part my suspense that was responsible for this; I waited\nimpatiently to see whether she wouldn’t have told Mrs. Mulville a portion\nat least of what I had learned from Gravener.  But I saw Mrs. Mulville\nwas still reduced to wonder what she had come out again for if she hadn’t\ncome as a conciliatory bride.  That she had come in some other character\nwas the only thing that fitted all the appearances.  Having for family\nreasons to spend some time that spring in the west of England, I was in a\nmanner out of earshot of the great oceanic rumble—I mean of the\ncontinuous hum of Saltram’s thought—and my uneasiness tended to keep me\nquiet.  There was something I wanted so little to have to say that my\nprudence surmounted my curiosity.  I only wondered if Ruth Anvoy talked\nover the idea of The Coxon Fund with Lady Maddock, and also somewhat why\nI didn’t hear from Wimbledon.  I had a reproachful note about something\nor other from Mrs. Saltram, but it contained no mention of Lady Coxon’s\nniece, on whom her eyes had been much less fixed since the recent\nuntoward events.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nPOOR Adelaide’s silence was fully explained later—practically explained\nwhen in June, returning to London, I was honoured by this admirable woman\nwith an early visit.  As soon as she arrived I guessed everything, and as\nsoon as she told me that darling Ruth had been in her house nearly a\nmonth I had my question ready.  “What in the name of maidenly modesty is\nshe staying in England for?”\n\n“Because she loves me so!” cried Adelaide gaily.  But she hadn’t come to\nsee me only to tell me Miss Anvoy loved her: that was quite sufficiently\nestablished, and what was much more to the point was that Mr. Gravener\nhad now raised an objection to it.  He had protested at least against her\nbeing at Wimbledon, where in the innocence of his heart he had originally\nbrought her himself; he called on her to put an end to their engagement\nin the only proper, the only happy manner.\n\n“And why in the world doesn’t she do do?” I asked.\n\nAdelaide had a pause.  “She says you know.”\n\nThen on my also hesitating she added: “A condition he makes.”\n\n“The Coxon Fund?” I panted.\n\n“He has mentioned to her his having told you about it.”\n\n“Ah but so little!  Do you mean she has accepted the trust?”\n\n“In the most splendid spirit—as a duty about which there can be no two\nopinions.”  To which my friend added: “Of course she’s thinking of Mr.\nSaltram.”\n\nI gave a quick cry at this, which, in its violence, made my visitor turn\npale.  “How very awful!”\n\n“Awful?”\n\n“Why, to have anything to do with such an idea one’s self.”\n\n“I’m sure _you_ needn’t!” and Mrs. Mulville tossed her head.\n\n“He isn’t good enough!” I went on; to which she opposed a sound almost as\ncontentious as my own had been.  This made me, with genuine immediate\nhorror, exclaim: “You haven’t influenced her, I hope!” and my emphasis\nbrought back the blood with a rush to poor Adelaide’s face.  She declared\nwhile she blushed—for I had frightened her again—that she had never\ninfluenced anybody and that the girl had only seen and heard and judged\nfor herself.  _He_ had influenced her, if I would, as he did every one\nwho had a soul: that word, as we knew, even expressed feebly the power of\nthe things he said to haunt the mind.  How could she, Adelaide, help it\nif Miss Anvoy’s mind was haunted?  I demanded with a groan what right a\npretty girl engaged to a rising M.P. had to _have_ a mind; but the only\nexplanation my bewildered friend could give me was that she was so\nclever.  She regarded Mr. Saltram naturally as a tremendous force for\ngood.  She was intelligent enough to understand him and generous enough\nto admire.\n\n“She’s many things enough, but is she, among them, rich enough?” I\ndemanded.  “Rich enough, I mean, to sacrifice such a lot of good money?”\n\n“That’s for herself to judge.  Besides, it’s not her own money; she\ndoesn’t in the least consider it so.”\n\n“And Gravener does, if not _his_ own; and that’s the whole difficulty?”\n\n“The difficulty that brought her back, yes: she had absolutely to see her\npoor aunt’s solicitor.  It’s clear that by Lady Coxon’s will she may have\nthe money, but it’s still clearer to her conscience that the original\ncondition, definite, intensely implied on her uncle’s part, is attached\nto the use of it.  She can only take one view of it.  It’s for the\nEndowment or it’s for nothing.”\n\n“The Endowment,” I permitted myself to observe, “is a conception\nsuperficially sublime, but fundamentally ridiculous.”\n\n“Are you repeating Mr. Gravener’s words?” Adelaide asked.\n\n“Possibly, though I’ve not seen him for months.  It’s simply the way it\nstrikes me too.  It’s an old wife’s tale.  Gravener made some reference\nto the legal aspect, but such an absurdly loose arrangement has _no_\nlegal aspect.”\n\n“Ruth doesn’t insist on that,” said Mrs. Mulville; “and it’s, for her,\nexactly this technical weakness that constitutes the force of the moral\nobligation.”\n\n“Are you repeating _her_ words?” I enquired.  I forget what else Adelaide\nsaid, but she said she was magnificent.  I thought of George Gravener\nconfronted with such magnificence as that, and I asked what could have\nmade two such persons ever suppose they understood each other.  Mrs.\nMulville assured me the girl loved him as such a woman could love and\nthat she suffered as such a woman could suffer.  Nevertheless she wanted\nto see _me_.  At this I sprang up with a groan.  “Oh I’m so sorry!—when?”\nSmall though her sense of humour, I think Adelaide laughed at my\nsequence.  We discussed the day, the nearest it would be convenient I\nshould come out; but before she went I asked my visitor how long she had\nbeen acquainted with these prodigies.\n\n“For several weeks, but I was pledged to secrecy.”\n\n“And that’s why you didn’t write?”\n\n“I couldn’t very well tell you she was with me without telling you that\nno time had even yet been fixed for her marriage.  And I couldn’t very\nwell tell you as much as that without telling you what I knew of the\nreason of it.  It was not till a day or two ago,” Mrs. Mulville went on,\n“that she asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t come and see her.  Then at\nlast she spoke of your knowing about the idea of the Endowment.”\n\nI turned this over.  “Why on earth does she want to see me?”\n\n“To talk with you, naturally, about Mr. Saltram.”\n\n“As a subject for the prize?”  This was hugely obvious, and I presently\nreturned: “I think I’ll sail to-morrow for Australia.”\n\n“Well then—sail!” said Mrs. Mulville, getting up.\n\nBut I frivolously, continued.  “On Thursday at five, we said?”  The\nappointment was made definite and I enquired how, all this time, the\nunconscious candidate had carried himself.\n\n“In perfection, really, by the happiest of chances: he has positively\nbeen a dear.  And then, as to what we revere him for, in the most\nwonderful form.  His very highest—pure celestial light.  You _won’t_ do\nhim an ill turn?” Adelaide pleaded at the door.\n\n“What danger can equal for him the danger to which he’s exposed from\nhimself?” I asked.  “Look out sharp, if he has lately been too prim.\nHe’ll presently take a day off, treat us to some exhibition that will\nmake an Endowment a scandal.”\n\n“A scandal?” Mrs. Mulville dolorously echoed.\n\n“Is Miss Anvoy prepared for that?”\n\nMy visitor, for a moment, screwed her parasol into my carpet.  “He grows\nbigger every day.”\n\n“So do you!” I laughed as she went off.\n\nThat girl at Wimbledon, on the Thursday afternoon, more than justified my\napprehensions.  I recognised fully now the cause of the agitation she had\nproduced in me from the first—the faint foreknowledge that there was\nsomething very stiff I should have to do for her.  I felt more than ever\ncommitted to my fate as, standing before her in the big drawing-room\nwhere they had tactfully left us to ourselves, I tried with a smile to\nstring together the pearls of lucidity which, from her chair, she\nsuccessively tossed me.  Pale and bright, in her monotonous mourning, she\nwas an image of intelligent purpose, of the passion of duty; but I asked\nmyself whether any girl had ever had so charming an instinct as that\nwhich permitted her to laugh out, as for the joy of her difficulty, into\nthe priggish old room.  This remarkable young woman could be earnest\nwithout being solemn, and at moments when I ought doubtless to have\ncursed her obstinacy I found myself watching the unstudied play of her\neyebrows or the recurrence of a singularly intense whiteness produced by\nthe parting of her lips.  These aberrations, I hasten to add, didn’t\nprevent my learning soon enough why she had wished to see me.  Her reason\nfor this was as distinct as her beauty: it was to make me explain what I\nhad meant, on the occasion of our first meeting, by Mr. Saltram’s want of\ndignity.  It wasn’t that she couldn’t imagine, but she desired it there\nfrom my lips.  What she really desired of course was to know whether\nthere was worse about him than what she had found out for herself.  She\nhadn’t been a month so much in the house with him without discovering\nthat he wasn’t a man of monumental bronze.  He was like a jelly minus its\nmould, he had to be embanked; and that was precisely the source of her\ninterest in him and the ground of her project.  She put her project\nboldly before me: there it stood in its preposterous beauty.  She was as\nwilling to take the humorous view of it as I could be: the only\ndifference was that for her the humorous view of a thing wasn’t\nnecessarily prohibitive, wasn’t paralysing.\n\nMoreover she professed that she couldn’t discuss with me the primary\nquestion—the moral obligation: that was in her own breast.  There were\nthings she couldn’t go into—injunctions, impressions she had received.\nThey were a part of the closest intimacy of her intercourse with her\naunt, they were absolutely clear to her; and on questions of delicacy,\nthe interpretation of a fidelity, of a promise, one had always in the\nlast resort to make up one’s mind for one’s self.  It was the idea of the\napplication to the particular case, such a splendid one at last, that\ntroubled her, and she admitted that it stirred very deep things.  She\ndidn’t pretend that such a responsibility was a simple matter; if it\n_had_ been she wouldn’t have attempted to saddle me with any portion of\nit.  The Mulvilles were sympathy itself, but were they absolutely candid?\nCould they indeed be, in their position—would it even have been to be\ndesired?  Yes, she had sent for me to ask no less than that of me—whether\nthere was anything dreadful kept back.  She made no allusion whatever to\nGeorge Gravener—I thought her silence the only good taste and her gaiety\nperhaps a part of the very anxiety of that discretion, the effect of a\ndetermination that people shouldn’t know from herself that her relations\nwith the man she was to marry were strained.  All the weight, however,\nthat she left me to throw was a sufficient implication of the weight _he_\nhad thrown in vain.  Oh she knew the question of character was immense,\nand that one couldn’t entertain any plan for making merit comfortable\nwithout running the gauntlet of that terrible procession of\ninterrogation-points which, like a young ladies’ school out for a walk,\nhooked their uniform noses at the tail of governess Conduct.  But were we\nabsolutely to hold that there was never, never, never an exception,\nnever, never, never an occasion for liberal acceptance, for clever\ncharity, for suspended pedantry—for letting one side, in short,\noutbalance another?  When Miss Anvoy threw off this appeal I could have\nembraced her for so delightfully emphasising her unlikeness to Mrs.\nSaltram.  “Why not have the courage of one’s forgiveness,” she asked, “as\nwell as the enthusiasm of one’s adhesion?”\n\n“Seeing how wonderfully you’ve threshed the whole thing out,” I evasively\nreplied, “gives me an extraordinary notion of the point your enthusiasm\nhas reached.”\n\nShe considered this remark an instant with her eyes on mine, and I\ndivined that it struck her I might possibly intend it as a reference to\nsome personal subjection to our fat philosopher, to some aberration of\nsensibility, some perversion of taste.  At least I couldn’t interpret\notherwise the sudden flash that came into her face.  Such a\nmanifestation, as the result of any word of mine, embarrassed me; but\nwhile I was thinking how to reassure her the flush passed away in a smile\nof exquisite good nature.  “Oh you see one forgets so wonderfully how one\ndislikes him!” she said; and if her tone simply extinguished his strange\nfigure with the brush of its compassion, it also rings in my ear to-day\nas the purest of all our praises.  But with what quick response of fine\npity such a relegation of the man himself made me privately sigh “Ah poor\nSaltram!”  She instantly, with this, took the measure of all I didn’t\nbelieve, and it enabled her to go on: “What can one do when a person has\ngiven such a lift to one’s interest in life?”\n\n“Yes, what can one do?”  If I struck her as a little vague it was because\nI was thinking of another person.  I indulged in another inarticulate\nmurmur—“Poor George Gravener!”  What had become of the lift _he_ had\ngiven that interest?  Later on I made up my mind that she was sore and\nstricken at the appearance he presented of wanting the miserable money.\nThis was the hidden reason of her alienation.  The probable sincerity, in\nspite of the illiberality, of his scruples about the particular use of it\nunder discussion didn’t efface the ugliness of his demand that they\nshould buy a good house with it.  Then, as for _his_ alienation, he\ndidn’t, pardonably enough, grasp the lift Frank Saltram had given her\ninterest in life.  If a mere spectator could ask that last question, with\nwhat rage in his heart the man himself might!  He wasn’t, like her, I was\nto see, too proud to show me why he was disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nI WAS unable this time to stay to dinner: such at any rate was the plea\non which I took leave.  I desired in truth to get away from my young\nlady, for that obviously helped me not to pretend to satisfy her.  How\n_could_ I satisfy her?  I asked myself—how could I tell her how much had\nbeen kept back?  I didn’t even know and I certainly didn’t desire to\nknow.  My own policy had ever been to learn the least about poor\nSaltram’s weaknesses—not to learn the most.  A great deal that I had in\nfact learned had been forced upon me by his wife.  There was something\neven irritating in Miss Anvoy’s crude conscientiousness, and I wondered\nwhy, after all, she couldn’t have let him alone and been content to\nentrust George Gravener with the purchase of the good house.  I was sure\nhe would have driven a bargain, got something excellent and cheap.  I\nlaughed louder even than she, I temporised, I failed her; I told her I\nmust think over her case.  I professed a horror of responsibilities and\ntwitted her with her own extravagant passion for them.  It wasn’t really\nthat I was afraid of the scandal, the moral discredit for the Fund; what\ntroubled me most was a feeling of a different order.  Of course, as the\nbeneficiary of the Fund was to enjoy a simple life-interest, as it was\nhoped that new beneficiaries would arise and come up to new standards, it\nwouldn’t be a trifle that the first of these worthies shouldn’t have been\na striking example of the domestic virtues.  The Fund would start badly,\nas it were, and the laurel would, in some respects at least, scarcely be\ngreener from the brows of the original wearer.  That idea, however, was\nat that hour, as I have hinted, not the source of solicitude it ought\nperhaps to have been, for I felt less the irregularity of Saltram’s\ngetting the money than that of this exalted young woman’s giving it up.\nI wanted her to have it for herself, and I told her so before I went\naway.  She looked graver at this than she had looked at all, saying she\nhoped such a preference wouldn’t make me dishonest.\n\nIt made me, to begin with, very restless—made me, instead of going\nstraight to the station, fidget a little about that many-coloured Common\nwhich gives Wimbledon horizons.  There was a worry for me to work off, or\nrather keep at a distance, for I declined even to admit to myself that I\nhad, in Miss Anvoy’s phrase, been saddled with it.  What could have been\nclearer indeed than the attitude of recognising perfectly what a world of\ntrouble The Coxon Fund would in future save us, and of yet liking better\nto face a continuance of that trouble than see, and in fact contribute\nto, a deviation from attainable bliss in the life of two other persons in\nwhom I was deeply interested?  Suddenly, at the end of twenty minutes,\nthere was projected across this clearness the image of a massive\nmiddle-aged man seated on a bench under a tree, with sad far-wandering\neyes and plump white hands folded on the head of a stick—a stick I\nrecognised, a stout gold-headed staff that I had given him in devoted\ndays.  I stopped short as he turned his face to me, and it happened that\nfor some reason or other I took in as I had perhaps never done before the\nbeauty of his rich blank gaze.  It was charged with experience as the sky\nis charged with light, and I felt on the instant as if we had been\noverspanned and conjoined by the great arch of a bridge or the great dome\nof a temple.  Doubtless I was rendered peculiarly sensitive to it by\nsomething in the way I had been giving him up and sinking him.  While I\nmet it I stood there smitten, and I felt myself responding to it with a\nsort of guilty grimace.  This brought back his attention in a smile which\nexpressed for me a cheerful weary patience, a bruised noble gentleness.\nI had told Miss Anvoy that he had no dignity, but what did he seem to me,\nall unbuttoned and fatigued as he waited for me to come up, if he didn’t\nseem unconcerned with small things, didn’t seem in short majestic?  There\nwas majesty in his mere unconsciousness of our little conferences and\npuzzlements over his maintenance and his reward.\n\nAfter I had sat by him a few minutes I passed my arm over his big soft\nshoulder—wherever you touched him you found equally little firmness—and\nsaid in a tone of which the suppliance fell oddly on my own ear: “Come\nback to town with me, old friend—come back and spend the evening.”  I\nwanted to hold him, I wanted to keep him, and at Waterloo, an hour later,\nI telegraphed possessively to the Mulvilles.  When he objected, as\nregards staying all night, that he had no things, I asked him if he\nhadn’t everything of mine.  I had abstained from ordering dinner, and it\nwas too late for preliminaries at a club; so we were reduced to tea and\nfried fish at my rooms—reduced also to the transcendent.  Something had\ncome up which made me want him to feel at peace with me—and which,\nprecisely, was all the dear man himself wanted on any occasion.  I had\ntoo often had to press upon him considerations irrelevant, but it gives\nme pleasure now to think that on that particular evening I didn’t even\nmention Mrs. Saltram and the children.  Late into the night we smoked and\ntalked; old shames and old rigours fell away from us; I only let him see\nthat I was conscious of what I owed him.  He was as mild as contrition\nand as copious as faith; he was never so fine as on a shy return, and\neven better at forgiving than at being forgiven.  I dare say it was a\nsmaller matter than that famous night at Wimbledon, the night of the\nproblematical sobriety and of Miss Anvoy’s initiation; but I was as much\nin it on this occasion as I had been out of it then.  At about 1.30 he\nwas sublime.\n\nHe never, in whatever situation, rose till all other risings were over,\nand his breakfasts, at Wimbledon, had always been the principal reason\nmentioned by departing cooks.  The coast was therefore clear for me to\nreceive her when, early the next morning, to my surprise, it was\nannounced to me his wife had called.  I hesitated, after she had come up,\nabout telling her Saltram was in the house, but she herself settled the\nquestion, kept me reticent by drawing forth a sealed letter which,\nlooking at me very hard in the eyes, she placed, with a pregnant absence\nof comment, in my hand.  For a single moment there glimmered before me\nthe fond hope that Mrs. Saltram had tendered me, as it were, her\nresignation and desired to embody the act in an unsparing form.  To bring\nthis about I would have feigned any humiliation; but after my eyes had\ncaught the superscription I heard myself say with a flatness that\nbetrayed a sense of something very different from relief: “Oh the\nPudneys!”  I knew their envelopes though they didn’t know mine.  They\nalways used the kind sold at post-offices with the stamp affixed, and as\nthis letter hadn’t been posted they had wasted a penny on me.  I had seen\ntheir horrid missives to the Mulvilles, but hadn’t been in direct\ncorrespondence with them.\n\n“They enclosed it to me, to be delivered.  They doubtless explain to you\nthat they hadn’t your address.”\n\nI turned the thing over without opening it.  “Why in the world should\nthey write to me?”\n\n“Because they’ve something to tell you.  The worst,” Mrs. Saltram dryly\nadded.\n\nIt was another chapter, I felt, of the history of their lamentable\nquarrel with her husband, the episode in which, vindictively,\ndisingenuously as they themselves had behaved, one had to admit that he\nhad put himself more grossly in the wrong than at any moment of his life.\nHe had begun by insulting the matchless Mulvilles for these more specious\nprotectors, and then, according to his wont at the end of a few months,\nhad dug a still deeper ditch for his aberration than the chasm left\nyawning behind.  The chasm at Wimbledon was now blessedly closed; but the\nPudneys, across their persistent gulf, kept up the nastiest fire.  I\nnever doubted they had a strong case, and I had been from the first for\nnot defending him—reasoning that if they weren’t contradicted they’d\nperhaps subside.  This was above all what I wanted, and I so far\nprevailed that I did arrest the correspondence in time to save our little\ncircle an infliction heavier than it perhaps would have borne.  I knew,\nthat is I divined, that their allegations had gone as yet only as far as\ntheir courage, conscious as they were in their own virtue of an exposed\nplace in which Saltram could have planted a blow.  It was a question with\nthem whether a man who had himself so much to cover up would dare his\nblow; so that these vessels of rancour were in a manner afraid of each\nother.  I judged that on the day the Pudneys should cease for some reason\nor other to be afraid they would treat us to some revelation more\ndisconcerting than any of its predecessors.  As I held Mrs. Saltram’s\nletter in my hand it was distinctly communicated to me that the day had\ncome—they had ceased to be afraid.  “I don’t want to know the worst,” I\npresently declared.\n\n“You’ll have to open the letter.  It also contains an enclosure.”\n\nI felt it—it was fat and uncanny.  “Wheels within wheels!” I exclaimed.\n“There’s something for me too to deliver.”\n\n“So they tell me—to Miss Anvoy.”\n\nI stared; I felt a certain thrill.  “Why don’t they send it to her\ndirectly?”\n\nMrs. Saltram hung fire.  “Because she’s staying with Mr. and Mrs.\nMulville.”\n\n“And why should that prevent?”\n\nAgain my visitor faltered, and I began to reflect on the grotesque, the\nunconscious perversity of her action.  I was the only person save George\nGravener and the Mulvilles who was aware of Sir Gregory Coxon’s and of\nMiss Anvoy’s strange bounty.  Where could there have been a more signal\nillustration of the clumsiness of human affairs than her having\ncomplacently selected this moment to fly in the face of it?  “There’s the\nchance of their seeing her letters.  They know Mr. Pudney’s hand.”\n\nStill I didn’t understand; then it flashed upon me.  “You mean they might\nintercept it?  How can you imply anything so base?” I indignantly\ndemanded.\n\n“It’s not I—it’s Mr. Pudney!” cried Mrs. Saltram with a flush.  “It’s his\nown idea.”\n\n“Then why couldn’t he send the letter to you to be delivered?”\n\nMrs. Saltram’s embarrassment increased; she gave me another hard look.\n“You must make that out for yourself.”\n\nI made it out quickly enough.  “It’s a denunciation?”\n\n“A real lady doesn’t betray her husband!” this virtuous woman exclaimed.\n\nI burst out laughing, and I fear my laugh may have had an effect of\nimpertinence.  “Especially to Miss Anvoy, who’s so easily shocked? Why do\nsuch things concern _her_?” I asked, much at a loss.\n\n“Because she’s there, exposed to all his craft.  Mr. and Mrs. Pudney have\nbeen watching this: they feel she may be taken in.”\n\n“Thank you for all the rest of us!  What difference can it make when she\nhas lost her power to contribute?”\n\nAgain Mrs. Saltram considered; then very nobly: “There are other things\nin the world than money.”  This hadn’t occurred to her so long as the\nyoung lady had any; but she now added, with a glance at my letter, that\nMr. and Mrs. Pudney doubtless explained their motives.  “It’s all in\nkindness,” she continued as she got up.\n\n“Kindness to Miss Anvoy?  You took, on the whole, another view of\nkindness before her reverses.”\n\nMy companion smiled with some acidity “Perhaps you’re no safer than the\nMulvilles!”\n\nI didn’t want her to think that, nor that she should report to the\nPudneys that they had not been happy in their agent; and I well remember\nthat this was the moment at which I began, with considerable emotion, to\npromise myself to enjoin upon Miss Anvoy never to open any letter that\nshould come to her in one of those penny envelopes.  My emotion, and I\nfear I must add my confusion, quickly deepened; I presently should have\nbeen as glad to frighten Mrs. Saltram as to think I might by some\ndiplomacy restore the Pudneys to a quieter vigilance.\n\n“It’s best you should take _my_ view of my safety,” I at any rate soon\nresponded.  When I saw she didn’t know what I meant by this I added: “You\nmay turn out to have done, in bringing me this letter, a thing you’ll\nprofoundly regret.”  My tone had a significance which, I could see, did\nmake her uneasy, and there was a moment, after I had made two or three\nmore remarks of studiously bewildering effect, at which her eyes followed\nso hungrily the little flourish of the letter with which I emphasised\nthem that I instinctively slipped Mr. Pudney’s communication into my\npocket.  She looked, in her embarrassed annoyance, capable of grabbing it\nto send it back to him.  I felt, after she had gone, as if I had almost\ngiven her my word I wouldn’t deliver the enclosure.  The passionate\nmovement, at any rate, with which, in solitude, I transferred the whole\nthing, unopened, from my pocket to a drawer which I double-locked would\nhave amounted, for an initiated observer, to some such pledge.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nMRS. SALTRAM left me drawing my breath more quickly and indeed almost in\npain—as if I had just perilously grazed the loss of something precious.\nI didn’t quite know what it was—it had a shocking resemblance to my\nhonour.  The emotion was the livelier surely in that my pulses even yet\nvibrated to the pleasure with which, the night before, I had rallied to\nthe rare analyst, the great intellectual adventurer and pathfinder.  What\nhad dropped from me like a cumbersome garment as Saltram appeared before\nme in the afternoon on the heath was the disposition to haggle over his\nvalue.  Hang it, one had to choose, one had to put that value somewhere;\nso I would put it really high and have done with it.  Mrs. Mulville drove\nin for him at a discreet hour—the earliest she could suppose him to have\ngot up; and I learned that Miss Anvoy would also have come had she not\nbeen expecting a visit from Mr. Gravener.  I was perfectly mindful that I\nwas under bonds to see this young lady, and also that I had a letter to\nhand to her; but I took my time, I waited from day to day.  I left Mrs.\nSaltram to deal as her apprehensions should prompt with the Pudneys.  I\nknew at last what I meant—I had ceased to wince at my responsibility.  I\ngave this supreme impression of Saltram time to fade if it would; but it\ndidn’t fade, and, individually, it hasn’t faded even now.  During the\nmonth that I thus invited myself to stiffen again, Adelaide Mulville,\nperplexed by my absence, wrote to me to ask why I _was_ so stiff.  At\nthat season of the year I was usually oftener “with” them.  She also\nwrote that she feared a real estrangement had set in between Mr. Gravener\nand her sweet young friend—a state of things but half satisfactory to her\nso long as the advantage resulting to Mr. Saltram failed to disengage\nitself from the merely nebulous state.  She intimated that her sweet\nyoung friend was, if anything, a trifle too reserved; she also intimated\nthat there might now be an opening for another clever young man.  There\nnever was the slightest opening, I may here parenthesise, and of course\nthe question can’t come up to-day.  These are old frustrations now.  Ruth\nAnvoy hasn’t married, I hear, and neither have I.  During the month,\ntoward the end, I wrote to George Gravener to ask if, on a special\nerrand, I might come to see him, and his answer was to knock the very\nnext day at my door.  I saw he had immediately connected my enquiry with\nthe talk we had had in the railway-carriage, and his promptitude showed\nthat the ashes of his eagerness weren’t yet cold.  I told him there was\nsomething I felt I ought in candour to let him know—I recognised the\nobligation his friendly confidence had laid on me.\n\n“You mean Miss Anvoy has talked to you?  She has told me so herself,” he\nsaid.\n\n“It wasn’t to tell you so that I wanted to see you,” I replied; “for it\nseemed to me that such a communication would rest wholly with herself.\nIf however she did speak to you of our conversation she probably told you\nI was discouraging.”\n\n“Discouraging?”\n\n“On the subject of a present application of The Coxon Fund.”\n\n“To the case of Mr. Saltram?  My dear fellow, I don’t know what you call\ndiscouraging!” Gravener cried.\n\n“Well I thought I was, and I thought she thought I was.”\n\n“I believe she did, but such a thing’s measured by the effect.  She’s not\n‘discouraged,’” he said.\n\n“That’s her own affair.  The reason I asked you to see me was that it\nappeared to me I ought to tell you frankly that—decidedly!—I can’t\nundertake to produce that effect.  In fact I don’t want to!”\n\n“It’s very good of you, damn you!” my visitor laughed, red and really\ngrave.  Then he said: “You’d like to see that scoundrel publicly\nglorified—perched on the pedestal of a great complimentary pension?”\n\nI braced myself.  “Taking one form of public recognition with another it\nseems to me on the whole I should be able to bear it.  When I see the\ncompliments that _are_ paid right and left I ask myself why this one\nshouldn’t take its course.  This therefore is what you’re entitled to\nhave looked to me to mention to you.  I’ve some evidence that perhaps\nwould be really dissuasive, but I propose to invite Mss Anvoy to remain\nin ignorance of it.”\n\n“And to invite me to do the same?”\n\n“Oh you don’t require it—you’ve evidence enough.  I speak of a sealed\nletter that I’ve been requested to deliver to her.”\n\n“And you don’t mean to?”\n\n“There’s only one consideration that would make me,” I said.\n\nGravener’s clear handsome eyes plunged into mine a minute, but evidently\nwithout fishing up a clue to this motive—a failure by which I was almost\nwounded.  “What does the letter contain?”\n\n“It’s sealed, as I tell you, and I don’t know what it contains.”\n\n“Why is it sent through you?”\n\n“Rather than you?” I wondered how to put the thing.  “The only\nexplanation I can think of is that the person sending it may have\nimagined your relations with Miss Anvoy to be at an end—may have been\ntold this is the case by Mrs. Saltram.”\n\n“My relations with Miss Anvoy are not at an end,” poor Gravener\nstammered.\n\nAgain for an instant I thought.  “The offer I propose to make you gives\nme the right to address you a question remarkably direct.  Are you still\nengaged to Miss Anvoy?”\n\n“No, I’m not,” he slowly brought out.  “But we’re perfectly good\nfriends.”\n\n“Such good friends that you’ll again become prospective husband and wife\nif the obstacle in your path be removed?”\n\n“Removed?” he anxiously repeated.\n\n“If I send Miss Anvoy the letter I speak of she may give up her idea.”\n\n“Then for God’s sake send it!”\n\n“I’ll do so if you’re ready to assure me that her sacrifice would now\npresumably bring about your marriage.”\n\n“I’d marry her the next day!” my visitor cried.\n\n“Yes, but would she marry _you_?  What I ask of you of course is nothing\nless than your word of honour as to your conviction of this.  If you give\nit me,” I said, “I’ll engage to hand her the letter before night.”\n\nGravener took up his hat; turning it mechanically round he stood looking\na moment hard at its unruffled perfection.  Then very angrily honestly\nand gallantly, “Hand it to the devil!” he broke out; with which he\nclapped the hat on his head and left me.\n\n“Will you read it or not?” I said to Ruth Anvoy, at Wimbledon, when I had\ntold her the story of Mrs. Saltram’s visit.\n\nShe debated for a time probably of the briefest, but long enough to make\nme nervous.  “Have you brought it with you?”\n\n“No indeed.  It’s at home, locked up.”\n\nThere was another great silence, and then she said “Go back and destroy\nit.”\n\nI went back, but I didn’t destroy it till after Saltram’s death, when I\nburnt it unread.  The Pudneys approached her again pressingly, but,\nprompt as they were, The Coxon Fund had already become an operative\nbenefit and a general amaze: Mr. Saltram, while we gathered about, as it\nwere, to watch the manna descend, had begun to draw the magnificent\nincome.  He drew it as he had always drawn everything, with a grand\nabstracted gesture.  Its magnificence, alas, as all the world now knows,\nquite quenched him; it was the beginning of his decline.  It was also\nnaturally a new grievance for his wife, who began to believe in him as\nsoon as he was blighted, and who at this hour accuses us of having bribed\nhim, on the whim of a meddlesome American, to renounce his glorious\noffice, to become, as she says, like everybody else.  The very day he\nfound himself able to publish he wholly ceased to produce.  This deprived\nus, as may easily be imagined, of much of our occupation, and especially\ndeprived the Mulvilles, whose want of self-support I never measured till\nthey lost their great inmate.  They’ve no one to live on now.  Adelaide’s\nmost frequent reference to their destitution is embodied in the remark\nthat dear far-away Ruth’s intentions were doubtless good.  She and Kent\nare even yet looking for another prop, but no one presents a true sphere\nof usefulness.  They complain that people are self-sufficing.  With\nSaltram the fine type of the child of adoption was scattered, the\ngrander, the elder style.  They’ve got their carriage back, but what’s an\nempty carriage?  In short I think we were all happier as well as poorer\nbefore; even including George Gravener, who by the deaths of his brother\nand his nephew has lately become Lord Maddock.  His wife, whose fortune\nclears the property, is criminally dull; he hates being in the Upper\nHouse, and hasn’t yet had high office.  But what are these accidents,\nwhich I should perhaps apologise for mentioning, in the light of the\ngreat eventual boon promised the patient by the rate at which The Coxon\nFund must be rolling up?", "answers": ["He is a guest in the home of the Mulvilles."], "length": 22692, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "341d214a2c377691bf20e5a30b8f7979696bd19141ad9c9f"}

Johnson, St. Paul's Church-Yard.\n\nMDCCLXXXVIII\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT.\n\n\nIn delineating the Heroine of this Fiction, the Author attempts to\ndevelop a character different from those generally portrayed. This woman\nis neither a Clarissa, a Lady G----, nor a[A] Sophie.--It would be vain\nto mention the various modifications of these models, as it would to\nremark, how widely artists wander from nature, when they copy the\noriginals of great masters. They catch the gross parts; but the subtile\nspirit evaporates; and not having the just ties, affectation disgusts,\nwhen grace was expected to charm.\n\nThose compositions only have power to delight, and carry us willing\ncaptives, where the soul of the author is exhibited, and animates the\nhidden springs. Lost in a pleasing enthusiasm, they live in the scenes\nthey represent; and do not measure their steps in a beaten track,\nsolicitous to gather expected flowers, and bind them in a wreath,\naccording to the prescribed rules of art.\n\nThese chosen few, wish to speak for themselves, and not to be an\necho--even of the sweetest sounds--or the reflector of the most sublime\nbeams. The[B] paradise they ramble in, must be of their own creating--or\nthe prospect soon grows insipid, and not varied by a vivifying\nprinciple, fades and dies.\n\nIn an artless tale, without episodes, the mind of a woman, who has\nthinking powers is displayed. The female organs have been thought too\nweak for this arduous employment; and experience seems to justify the\nassertion. Without arguing physically about _possibilities_--in a\nfiction, such a being may be allowed to exist; whose grandeur is derived\nfrom the operations of its own faculties, not subjugated to opinion; but\ndrawn by the individual from the original source.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote A: Rousseau.]\n\n[Footnote B: I here give the Reviewers an opportunity of being very\nwitty about the Paradise of Fools, &c.]\n\n\n\n\nMARY\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. I.\n\n\nMary, the heroine of this fiction, was the daughter of Edward, who\nmarried Eliza, a gentle, fashionable girl, with a kind of indolence in\nher temper, which might be termed negative good-nature: her virtues,\nindeed, were all of that stamp. She carefully attended to the _shews_ of\nthings, and her opinions, I should have said prejudices, were such as\nthe generality approved of. She was educated with the expectation of a\nlarge fortune, of course became a mere machine: the homage of her\nattendants made a great part of her puerile amusements, and she never\nimagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil: notions of\nher own consequence, by these means, were interwoven in her mind, and\nthe years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments,\nwithout having any taste for them. When she was first introduced into\nthe polite circle, she danced with an officer, whom she faintly wished\nto be united to; but her father soon after recommending another in a\nmore distinguished rank of life, she readily submitted to his will, and\npromised to love, honour, and obey, (a vicious fool,) as in duty bound.\n\nWhile they resided in London, they lived in the usual fashionable style,\nand seldom saw each other; nor were they much more sociable when they\nwooed rural felicity for more than half the year, in a delightful\ncountry, where Nature, with lavish hand, had scattered beauties around;\nfor the master, with brute, unconscious gaze, passed them by unobserved,\nand sought amusement in country sports. He hunted in the morning, and\nafter eating an immoderate dinner, generally fell asleep: this\nseasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load; he would then\nvisit some of his pretty tenants; and when he compared their ruddy glow\nof health with his wife's countenance, which even rouge could not\nenliven, it is not necessary to say which a _gourmand_ would give the\npreference to. Their vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more\nagreeable to his fancy than her sickly, die-away languor. Her voice was\nbut the shadow of a sound, and she had, to complete her delicacy, so\nrelaxed her nerves, that she became a mere nothing.\n\nMany such noughts are there in the female world! yet she had a good\nopinion of her own merit,--truly, she said long prayers,--and sometimes\nread her Week's Preparation: she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly\ncalled _hell_, the regions below; but whether her's was a mounting\nspirit, I cannot pretend to determine; or what sort of a planet would\nhave been proper for her, when she left her _material_ part in this\nworld, let metaphysicians settle; I have nothing to say to her unclothed\nspirit.\n\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone, or only with her French\nwaiting-maid, she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications,\nand while she was dressing her hair, and she could turn her eyes from\nthe glass, she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily\ndissipation, novels. I say bodily, or the animal soul, for a rational\none can find no employment in polite circles. The glare of lights, the\nstudied inelegancies of dress, and the compliments offered up at the\nshrine of false beauty, are all equally addressed to the senses.\n\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way, she\ntried another. The Platonic Marriage, Eliza Warwick, and some other\ninteresting tales were perused with eagerness. Nothing could be more\nnatural than the developement of the passions, nor more striking than\nthe views of the human heart. What delicate struggles! and uncommonly\npretty turns of thought! The picture that was found on a bramble-bush,\nthe new sensitive-plant, or tree, which caught the swain by the\nupper-garment, and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait.--Fatal\nimage!--It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart, and sent a\nnew kind of a knight-errant into the world. But even this was nothing to\nthe catastrophe, and the circumstance on which it hung, the hornet\nsettling on the sleeping lover's face. What a _heart-rending_ accident!\nShe planted, in imitation of those susceptible souls, a rose bush; but\nthere was not a lover to weep in concert with her, when she watered it\nwith her tears.--Alas! Alas!\n\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy, and give me credit\nfor genius, I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the\nsweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful\ncheeks, to the discomposure of rouge, &c. &c. Nay, I would make it so\ninteresting, that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to\nsettle the curls himself, and not interrupt her.\n\nShe had besides another resource, two most beautiful dogs, who shared\nher bed, and reclined on cushions near her all the day. These she\nwatched with the most assiduous care, and bestowed on them the warmest\ncaresses. This fondness for animals was not that kind of\n_attendrissement_ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for\nthe subsistence and comfort of a living creature; but it proceeded from\nvanity, it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French\nexpressions of ecstatic fondness, in accents that had never been attuned\nby tenderness.\n\nShe was chaste, according to the vulgar acceptation of the word, that\nis, she did not make any actual _faux pas_; she feared the world, and\nwas indolent; but then, to make amends for this seeming self-denial, she\nread all the sentimental novels, dwelt on the love-scenes, and, had she\nthought while she read, her mind would have been contaminated; as she\naccompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors, and would walk with them by\nthe clear light of the moon. She wondered her husband did not stay at\nhome. She was jealous--why did he not love her, sit by her side, squeeze\nher hand, and look unutterable things? Gentle reader, I will tell thee;\nthey neither of them felt what they could not utter. I will not pretend\nto say that they always annexed an idea to a word; but they had none of\nthose feelings which are not easily analyzed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. II.\n\n\nIn due time she brought forth a son, a feeble babe; and the following\nyear a daughter. After the mother's throes she felt very few sentiments\nof maternal tenderness: the children were given to nurses, and she\nplayed with her dogs. Want of exercise prevented the least chance of her\nrecovering strength; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a\nconsumption, to which her constitution tended. Her children all died in\ntheir infancy, except the two first, and she began to grow fond of the\nson, as he was remarkably handsome. For years she divided her time\nbetween the sofa, and the card-table. She thought not of death, though\non the borders of the grave; nor did any of the duties of her station\noccur to her as necessary. Her children were left in the nursery; and\nwhen Mary, the little blushing girl, appeared, she would send the\nawkward thing away. To own the truth, she was awkward enough, in a house\nwithout any play-mates; for her brother had been sent to school, and she\nscarcely knew how to employ herself; she would ramble about the garden,\nadmire the flowers, and play with the dogs. An old house-keeper told her\nstories, read to her, and, at last, taught her to read. Her mother\ntalked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit; and,\nin the interim desired her own maid to teach her French. As she had\nlearned to read, she perused with avidity every book that came in her\nway. Neglected in every respect, and left to the operations of her own\nmind, she considered every thing that came under her inspection, and\nlearned to think. She had heard of a separate state, and that angels\nsometimes visited this earth. She would sit in a thick wood in the park,\nand talk to them; make little songs addressed to them, and sing them to\ntunes of her own composing; and her native wood notes wild were sweet\nand touching.\n\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements, and was glad\nthat his wife's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself\nabout them. She had besides another reason, she did not wish to have a\nfine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter; she still\nexpected to recover, and figure away in the gay world. Her husband was\nvery tyrannical and passionate; indeed so very easily irritated when\ninebriated, that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten\nher mother to death; her sickness called forth all Mary's tenderness,\nand exercised her compassion so continually, that it became more than a\nmatch for self-love, and was the governing propensity of her heart\nthrough life. She was violent in her temper; but she saw her father's\nfaults, and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her\nown.--She did more; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon, when she\nwas conscious of having erred; and her contrition was so exceedingly\npainful, that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and\nimpatience, to save herself this cruel remorse.\n\nSublime ideas filled her young mind--always connected with devotional\nsentiments; extemporary effusions of gratitude, and rhapsodies of\npraise would burst often from her, when she listened to the birds, or\npursued the deer. She would gaze on the moon, and ramble through the\ngloomy path, observing the various shapes the clouds assumed, and listen\nto the sea that was not far distant. The wandering spirits, which she\nimagined inhabited every part of nature, were her constant friends and\nconfidants. She began to consider the Great First Cause, formed just\nnotions of his attributes, and, in particular, dwelt on his wisdom and\ngoodness. Could she have loved her father or mother, had they returned\nher affection, she would not so soon, perhaps, have sought out a new\nworld.\n\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love; on earth\nit was not to be found: her mother had often disappointed her, and the\napparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite\npain--produced a kind of habitual melancholy, led her into a fondness\nfor reading tales of woe, and made her almost realize the fictitious\ndistress.\n\nShe had not any notion of death till a little chicken expired at her\nfeet; and her father had a dog hung in a passion. She then concluded\nanimals had souls, or they would not have been subjected to the caprice\nof man; but what was the soul of man or beast? In this style year after\nyear rolled on, her mother still vegetating.\n\nA little girl who attended in the nursery fell sick. Mary paid her great\nattention; contrary to her wish, she was sent out of the house to her\nmother, a poor woman, whom necessity obliged to leave her sick child\nwhile she earned her daily bread. The poor wretch, in a fit of delirium\nstabbed herself, and Mary saw her dead body, and heard the dismal\naccount; and so strongly did it impress her imagination, that every\nnight of her life the bleeding corpse presented itself to her when the\nfirst began to slumber. Tortured by it, she at last made a vow, that if\nshe was ever mistress of a family she would herself watch over every\npart of it. The impression that this accident made was indelible.\n\nAs her mother grew imperceptibly worse and worse, her father, who did\nnot understand such a lingering complaint, imagined his wife was only\ngrown still more whimsical, and that if she could be prevailed on to\nexert herself, her health would soon be re-established. In general he\ntreated her with indifference; but when her illness at all interfered\nwith his pleasures, he expostulated in the most cruel manner, and\nvisibly harassed the invalid. Mary would then assiduously try to turn\nhis attention to something else; and when sent out of the room, would\nwatch at the door, until the storm was over, for unless it was, she\ncould not rest. Other causes also contributed to disturb her repose: her\nmother's luke-warm manner of performing her religious duties, filled her\nwith anguish; and when she observed her father's vices, the unbidden\ntears would flow. She was miserable when beggars were driven from the\ngate without being relieved; if she could do it unperceived, she would\ngive them her own breakfast, and feel gratified, when, in consequence of\nit, she was pinched by hunger.\n\nShe had once, or twice, told her little secrets to her mother; they were\nlaughed at, and she determined never to do it again. In this manner was\nshe left to reflect on her own feelings; and so strengthened were they\nby being meditated on, that her character early became singular and\npermanent. Her understanding was strong and clear, when not clouded by\nher feelings; but she was too much the creature of impulse, and the\nslave of compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. III.\n\n\nNear her father's house lived a poor widow, who had been brought up in\naffluence, but reduced to great distress by the extravagance of her\nhusband; he had destroyed his constitution while he spent his fortune;\nand dying, left his wife, and five small children, to live on a very\nscanty pittance. The eldest daughter was for some years educated by a\ndistant relation, a Clergyman. While she was with him a young gentleman,\nson to a man of property in the neighbourhood, took particular notice of\nher. It is true, he never talked of love; but then they played and sung\nin concert; drew landscapes together, and while she worked he read to\nher, cultivated her taste, and stole imperceptibly her heart. Just at\nthis juncture, when smiling, unanalyzed hope made every prospect bright,\nand gay expectation danced in her eyes, her benefactor died. She\nreturned to her mother--the companion of her youth forgot her, they took\nno more sweet counsel together. This disappointment spread a sadness\nover her countenance, and made it interesting. She grew fond of\nsolitude, and her character appeared similar to Mary's, though her\nnatural disposition was very different.\n\nShe was several years older than Mary, yet her refinement, her taste,\ncaught her eye, and she eagerly sought her friendship: before her return\nshe had assisted the family, which was almost reduced to the last ebb;\nand now she had another motive to actuate her.\n\nAs she had often occasion to send messages to Ann, her new friend,\nmistakes were frequently made; Ann proposed that in future they should\nbe written ones, to obviate this difficulty, and render their\nintercourse more agreeable. Young people are mostly fond of scribbling;\nMary had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's\nletters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little\npractice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave\nforce to it. In conversation, and in writing, when she felt, she was\npathetic, tender and persuasive; and she expressed contempt with such\nenergy, that few could stand the flash of her eyes.\n\nAs she grew more intimate with Ann, her manners were softened, and she\nacquired a degree of equality in her behaviour: yet still her spirits\nwere fluctuating, and her movements rapid. She felt less pain on\naccount of her mother's partiality to her brother, as she hoped now to\nexperience the pleasure of being beloved; but this hope led her into new\nsorrows, and, as usual, paved the way for disappointment. Ann only felt\ngratitude; her heart was entirely engrossed by one object, and\nfriendship could not serve as a substitute; memory officiously retraced\npast scenes, and unavailing wishes made time loiter.\n\nMary was often hurt by the involuntary indifference which these\nconsequences produced. When her friend was all the world to her, she\nfound she was not as necessary to her happiness; and her delicate mind\ncould not bear to obtrude her affection, or receive love as an alms, the\noffspring of pity. Very frequently has she ran to her with delight, and\nnot perceiving any thing of the same kind in Ann's countenance, she has\nshrunk back; and, falling from one extreme into the other, instead of a\nwarm greeting that was just slipping from her tongue, her expressions\nseemed to be dictated by the most chilling insensibility.\n\nShe would then imagine that she looked sickly or unhappy, and then all\nher tenderness would return like a torrent, and bear away all\nreflection. In this manner was her sensibility called forth, and\nexercised, by her mother's illness, her friend's misfortunes, and her\nown unsettled mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IV.\n\n\nNear to her father's house was a range of mountains; some of them were,\nliterally speaking, cloud-capt, for on them clouds continually rested,\nand gave grandeur to the prospect; and down many of their sides the\nlittle bubbling cascades ran till they swelled a beautiful river.\nThrough the straggling trees and bushes the wind whistled, and on them\nthe birds sung, particularly the robins; they also found shelter in the\nivy of an old castle, a haunted one, as the story went; it was situated\non the brow of one of the mountains, and commanded a view of the sea.\nThis castle had been inhabited by some of her ancestors; and many tales\nhad the old house-keeper told her of the worthies who had resided there.\n\nWhen her mother frowned, and her friend looked cool, she would steal to\nthis retirement, where human foot seldom trod--gaze on the sea, observe\nthe grey clouds, or listen to the wind which struggled to free itself\nfrom the only thing that impeded its course. When more cheerful, she\nadmired the various dispositions of light and shade, the beautiful tints\nthe gleams of sunshine gave to the distant hills; then she rejoiced in\nexistence, and darted into futurity.\n\nOne way home was through the cavity of a rock covered with a thin layer\nof earth, just sufficient to afford nourishment to a few stunted shrubs\nand wild plants, which grew on its sides, and nodded over the summit. A\nclear stream broke out of it, and ran amongst the pieces of rocks\nfallen into it. Here twilight always reigned--it seemed the Temple of\nSolitude; yet, paradoxical as the assertion may appear, when the foot\nsounded on the rock, it terrified the intruder, and inspired a strange\nfeeling, as if the rightful sovereign was dislodged. In this retreat she\nread Thomson's Seasons, Young's Night-Thoughts, and Paradise Lost.\n\nAt a little distance from it were the huts of a few poor fishermen, who\nsupported their numerous children by their precarious labour. In these\nlittle huts she frequently rested, and denied herself every childish\ngratification, in order to relieve the necessities of the inhabitants.\nHer heart yearned for them, and would dance with joy when she had\nrelieved their wants, or afforded them pleasure.\n\nIn these pursuits she learned the luxury of doing good; and the sweet\ntears of benevolence frequently moistened her eyes, and gave them a\nsparkle which, exclusive of that, they had not; on the contrary, they\nwere rather fixed, and would never have been observed if her soul had\nnot animated them. They were not at all like those brilliant ones which\nlook like polished diamonds, and dart from every superfice, giving more\nlight to the beholders than they receive themselves.\n\nHer benevolence, indeed, knew no bounds; the distress of others carried\nher out of herself; and she rested not till she had relieved or\ncomforted them. The warmth of her compassion often made her so diligent,\nthat many things occurred to her, which might have escaped a less\ninterested observer.\n\nIn like manner, she entered with such spirit into whatever she read,\nand the emotions thereby raised were so strong, that it soon became a\npart of her mind.\n\nEnthusiastic sentiments of devotion at this period actuated her; her\nCreator was almost apparent to her senses in his works; but they were\nmostly the grand or solemn features of Nature which she delighted to\ncontemplate. She would stand and behold the waves rolling, and think of\nthe voice that could still the tumultuous deep.\n\nThese propensities gave the colour to her mind, before the passions\nbegan to exercise their tyrannic sway, and particularly pointed out\nthose which the soil would have a tendency to nurse.\n\nYears after, when wandering through the same scenes, her imagination has\nstrayed back, to trace the first placid sentiments they inspired, and\nshe would earnestly desire to regain the same peaceful tranquillity.\n\nMany nights she sat up, if I may be allowed the expression, _conversing_\nwith the Author of Nature, making verses, and singing hymns of her own\ncomposing. She considered also, and tried to discern what end her\nvarious faculties were destined to pursue; and had a glimpse of a truth,\nwhich afterwards more fully unfolded itself.\n\nShe thought that only an infinite being could fill the human soul, and\nthat when other objects were followed as a means of happiness, the\ndelusion led to misery, the consequence of disappointment. Under the\ninfluence of ardent affections, how often has she forgot this\nconviction, and as often returned to it again, when it struck her with\nredoubled force. Often did she taste unmixed delight; her joys, her\necstacies arose from genius.\n\nShe was now fifteen, and she wished to receive the holy sacrament; and\nperusing the scriptures, and discussing some points of doctrine which\npuzzled her, she would sit up half the night, her favourite time for\nemploying her mind; she too plainly perceived that she saw through a\nglass darkly; and that the bounds set to stop our intellectual\nresearches, is one of the trials of a probationary state.\n\nBut her affections were roused by the display of divine mercy; and she\neagerly desired to commemorate the dying love of her great benefactor.\nThe night before the important day, when she was to take on herself her\nbaptismal vow, she could not go to bed; the sun broke in on her\nmeditations, and found her not exhausted by her watching.\n\nThe orient pearls were strewed around--she hailed the morn, and sung\nwith wild delight, Glory to God on high, good will towards men. She was\nindeed so much affected when she joined in the prayer for her eternal\npreservation, that she could hardly conceal her violent emotions; and\nthe recollection never failed to wake her dormant piety when earthly\npassions made it grow languid.\n\nThese various movements of her mind were not commented on, nor were the\nluxuriant shoots restrained by culture. The servants and the poor adored\nher.\n\nIn order to be enabled to gratify herself in the highest degree, she\npracticed the most rigid oeconomy, and had such power over her\nappetites and whims, that without any great effort she conquered them\nso entirely, that when her understanding or affections had an object,\nshe almost forgot she had a body which required nourishment.\n\nThis habit of thinking, this kind of absorption, gave strength to the\npassions.\n\nWe will now enter on the more active field of life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. V.\n\n\nA few months after Mary was turned of seventeen, her brother was\nattacked by a violent fever, and died before his father could reach the\nschool.\n\nShe was now an heiress, and her mother began to think her of\nconsequence, and did not call her _the child_. Proper masters were sent\nfor; she was taught to dance, and an extraordinary master procured to\nperfect her in that most necessary of all accomplishments.\n\nA part of the estate she was to inherit had been litigated, and the heir\nof the person who still carried on a Chancery suit, was only two years\nyounger than our heroine. The fathers, spite of the dispute, frequently\nmet, and, in order to settle it amicably, they one day, over a bottle,\ndetermined to quash it by a marriage, and, by uniting the two estates,\nto preclude all farther enquiries into the merits of their different\nclaims.\n\nWhile this important matter was settling, Mary was otherwise employed.\nAnn's mother's resources were failing; and the ghastly phantom, poverty,\nmade hasty strides to catch them in his clutches. Ann had not fortitude\nenough to brave such accumulated misery; besides, the canker-worm was\nlodged in her heart, and preyed on her health. She denied herself every\nlittle comfort; things that would be no sacrifice when a person is well,\nare absolutely necessary to alleviate bodily pain, and support the\nanimal functions.\n\nThere were many elegant amusements, that she had acquired a relish for,\nwhich might have taken her mind off from its most destructive bent; but\nthese her indigence would not allow her to enjoy: forced then, by way of\nrelaxation, to play the tunes her lover admired, and handle the pencil\nhe taught her to hold, no wonder his image floated on her imagination,\nand that taste invigorated love.\n\nPoverty, and all its inelegant attendants, were in her mother's abode;\nand she, though a good sort of a woman, was not calculated to banish, by\nher trivial, uninteresting chat, the delirium in which her daughter was\nlost.\n\nThis ill-fated love had given a bewitching softness to her manners, a\ndelicacy so truly feminine, that a man of any feeling could not behold\nher without wishing to chase her sorrows away. She was timid and\nirresolute, and rather fond of dissipation; grief only had power to make\nher reflect.\n\nIn every thing it was not the great, but the beautiful, or the pretty,\nthat caught her attention. And in composition, the polish of style, and\nharmony of numbers, interested her much more than the flights of genius,\nor abstracted speculations.\n\nShe often wondered at the books Mary chose, who, though she had a lively\nimagination, would frequently study authors whose works were addressed\nto the understanding. This liking taught her to arrange her thoughts,\nand argue with herself, even when under the influence of the most\nviolent passions.\n\nAnn's misfortunes and ill health were strong ties to bind Mary to her;\nshe wished so continually to have a home to receive her in, that it\ndrove every other desire out of her mind; and, dwelling on the tender\nschemes which compassion and friendship dictated, she longed most\nardently to put them in practice.\n\nFondly as she loved her friend, she did not forget her mother, whose\ndecline was so imperceptible, that they were not aware of her\napproaching dissolution. The physician, however, observing the most\nalarming symptoms; her husband was apprised of her immediate danger; and\nthen first mentioned to her his designs with respect to his daughter.\n\nShe approved of them; Mary was sent for; she was not at home; she had\nrambled to visit Ann, and found her in an hysteric fit. The landlord of\nher little farm had sent his agent for the rent, which had long been due\nto him; and he threatened to seize the stock that still remained, and\nturn them out, if they did not very shortly discharge the arrears.\n\nAs this man made a private fortune by harassing the tenants of the\nperson to whom he was deputy, little was to be expected from his\nforbearance.\n\nAll this was told to Mary--and the mother added, she had many other\ncreditors who would, in all probability, take the alarm, and snatch from\nthem all that had been saved out of the wreck. \"I could bear all,\" she\ncried; \"but what will become of my children? Of this child,\" pointing to\nthe fainting Ann, \"whose constitution is already undermined by care and\ngrief--where will she go?\"--Mary's heart ceased to beat while she asked\nthe question--She attempted to speak; but the inarticulate sounds died\naway. Before she had recovered herself, her father called himself to\nenquire for her; and desired her instantly to accompany him home.\n\nEngrossed by the scene of misery she had been witness to, she walked\nsilently by his side, when he roused her out of her reverie by telling\nher that in all likelihood her mother had not many hours to live; and\nbefore she could return him any answer, informed her that they had both\ndetermined to marry her to Charles, his friend's son; he added, the\nceremony was to be performed directly, that her mother might be witness\nof it; for such a desire she had expressed with childish eagerness.\n\nOverwhelmed by this intelligence, Mary rolled her eyes about, then, with\na vacant stare, fixed them on her father's face; but they were no longer\na sense; they conveyed no ideas to the brain. As she drew near the\nhouse, her wonted presence of mind returned: after this suspension of\nthought, a thousand darted into her mind,--her dying mother,--her\nfriend's miserable situation,--and an extreme horror at taking--at being\nforced to take, such a hasty step; but she did not feel the disgust, the\nreluctance, which arises from a prior attachment.\n\nShe loved Ann better than any one in the world--to snatch her from the\nvery jaws of destruction--she would have encountered a lion. To have\nthis friend constantly with her; to make her mind easy with respect to\nher family, would it not be superlative bliss?\n\nFull of these thoughts she entered her mother's chamber, but they then\nfled at the sight of a dying parent. She went to her, took her hand; it\nfeebly pressed her's. \"My child,\" said the languid mother: the words\nreached her heart; she had seldom heard them pronounced with accents\ndenoting affection; \"My child, I have not always treated you with\nkindness--God forgive me! do you?\"--Mary's tears strayed in a\ndisregarded stream; on her bosom the big drops fell, but did not relieve\nthe fluttering tenant. \"I forgive you!\" said she, in a tone of\nastonishment.\n\nThe clergyman came in to read the service for the sick, and afterwards\nthe marriage ceremony was performed. Mary stood like a statue of\nDespair, and pronounced the awful vow without thinking of it; and then\nran to support her mother, who expired the same night in her arms.\n\nHer husband set off for the continent the same day, with a tutor, to\nfinish his studies at one of the foreign universities.\n\nAnn was sent for to console her, not on account of the departure of her\nnew relation, a boy she seldom took any notice of, but to reconcile her\nto her fate; besides, it was necessary she should have a female\ncompanion, and there was not any maiden aunt in the family, or cousin of\nthe same class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VI.\n\n\nMary was allowed to pay the rent which gave her so much uneasiness, and\nshe exerted every nerve to prevail on her father effectually to succour\nthe family; but the utmost she could obtain was a small sum very\ninadequate to the purpose, to enable the poor woman to carry into\nexecution a little scheme of industry near the metropolis.\n\nHer intention of leaving that part of the country, had much more weight\nwith him, than Mary's arguments, drawn from motives of philanthropy and\nfriendship; this was a language he did not understand; expressive of\noccult qualities he never thought of, as they could not be seen or\nfelt.\n\nAfter the departure of her mother, Ann still continued to languish,\nthough she had a nurse who was entirely engrossed by the desire of\namusing her. Had her health been re-established, the time would have\npassed in a tranquil, improving manner.\n\nDuring the year of mourning they lived in retirement; music, drawing,\nand reading, filled up the time; and Mary's taste and judgment were both\nimproved by contracting a habit of observation, and permitting the\nsimple beauties of Nature to occupy her thoughts.\n\nShe had a wonderful quickness in discerning distinctions and combining\nideas, that at the first glance did not appear to be similar. But these\nvarious pursuits did not banish all her cares, or carry off all her\nconstitutional black bile. Before she enjoyed Ann's society, she\nimagined it would have made her completely happy: she was disappointed,\nand yet knew not what to complain of.\n\nAs her friend could not accompany her in her walks, and wished to be\nalone, for a very obvious reason, she would return to her old haunts,\nretrace her anticipated pleasures--and wonder how they changed their\ncolour in possession, and proved so futile.\n\nShe had not yet found the companion she looked for. Ann and she were not\ncongenial minds, nor did she contribute to her comfort in the degree she\nexpected. She shielded her from poverty; but this was only a negative\nblessing; when under the pressure it was very grievous, and still more\nso were the apprehensions; but when exempt from them, she was not\ncontented.\n\nSuch is human nature, its laws were not to be inverted to gratify our\nheroine, and stop the progress of her understanding, happiness only\nflourished in paradise--we cannot taste and live.\n\nAnother year passed away with increasing apprehensions. Ann had a hectic\ncough, and many unfavourable prognostics: Mary then forgot every thing\nbut the fear of losing her, and even imagined that her recovery would\nhave made her happy.\n\nHer anxiety led her to study physic, and for some time she only read\nbooks of that cast; and this knowledge, literally speaking, ended in\nvanity and vexation of spirit, as it enabled her to foresee what she\ncould not prevent.\n\nAs her mind expanded, her marriage appeared a dreadful misfortune; she\nwas sometimes reminded of the heavy yoke, and bitter was the\nrecollection!\n\nIn one thing there seemed to be a sympathy between them, for she wrote\nformal answers to his as formal letters. An extreme dislike took root in\nher mind; the found of his name made her turn sick; but she forgot all,\nlistening to Ann's cough, and supporting her languid frame. She would\nthen catch her to her bosom with convulsive eagerness, as if to save her\nfrom sinking into an opening grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VII.\n\n\nIt was the will of Providence that Mary should experience almost every\nspecies of sorrow. Her father was thrown from his horse, when his blood\nwas in a very inflammatory state, and the bruises were very dangerous;\nhis recovery was not expected by the physical tribe.\n\nTerrified at seeing him so near death, and yet so ill prepared for it,\nhis daughter sat by his bed, oppressed by the keenest anguish, which her\npiety increased.\n\nHer grief had nothing selfish in it; he was not a friend or protector;\nbut he was her father, an unhappy wretch, going into eternity, depraved\nand thoughtless. Could a life of sensuality be a preparation for a\npeaceful death? Thus meditating, she passed the still midnight hour by\nhis bedside.\n\nThe nurse fell asleep, nor did a violent thunder storm interrupt her\nrepose, though it made the night appear still more terrific to Mary. Her\nfather's unequal breathing alarmed her, when she heard a long drawn\nbreath, she feared it was his last, and watching for another, a dreadful\npeal of thunder struck her ears. Considering the separation of the soul\nand body, this night seemed sadly solemn, and the hours long.\n\nDeath is indeed a king of terrors when he attacks the vicious man! The\ncompassionate heart finds not any comfort; but dreads an eternal\nseparation. No transporting greetings are anticipated, when the\nsurvivors also shall have finished their course; but all is black!--the\ngrave may truly be said to receive the departed--this is the sting of\ndeath!\n\nNight after night Mary watched, and this excessive fatigue impaired her\nown health, but had a worse effect on Ann; though she constantly went to\nbed, she could not rest; a number of uneasy thoughts obtruded\nthemselves; and apprehensions about Mary, whom she loved as well as her\nexhausted heart could love, harassed her mind. After a sleepless,\nfeverish night she had a violent fit of coughing, and burst a\nblood-vessel. The physician, who was in the house, was sent for, and\nwhen he left the patient, Mary, with an authoritative voice, insisted on\nknowing his real opinion. Reluctantly he gave it, that her friend was in\na critical state; and if she passed the approaching winter in England,\nhe imagined she would die in the spring; a season fatal to consumptive\ndisorders. The spring!--Her husband was then expected.--Gracious Heaven,\ncould she bear all this.\n\nIn a few days her father breathed his last. The horrid sensations his\ndeath occasioned were too poignant to be durable: and Ann's danger, and\nher own situation, made Mary deliberate what mode of conduct she should\npursue. She feared this event might hasten the return of her husband,\nand prevent her putting into execution a plan she had determined on. It\nwas to accompany Ann to a more salubrious climate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. VIII.\n\n\nI mentioned before, that Mary had never had any particular attachment,\nto give rise to the disgust that daily gained ground. Her friendship for\nAnn occupied her heart, and resembled a passion. She had had, indeed,\nseveral transient likings; but they did not amount to love. The society\nof men of genius delighted her, and improved her faculties. With beings\nof this class she did not often meet; it is a rare genus; her first\nfavourites were men past the meridian of life, and of a philosophic\nturn.\n\nDetermined on going to the South of France, or Lisbon; she wrote to the\nman she had promised to obey. The physicians had said change of air was\nnecessary for her as well as her friend. She mentioned this, and added,\n\"Her comfort, almost her existence, depended on the recovery of the\ninvalid she wished to attend; and that should she neglect to follow the\nmedical advice she had received, she should never forgive herself, or\nthose who endeavoured to prevent her.\" Full of her design, she wrote\nwith more than usual freedom; and this letter was like most of her\nothers, a transcript of her heart.\n\n\"This dear friend,\" she exclaimed, \"I love for her agreeable qualities,\nand substantial virtues. Continual attention to her health, and the\ntender office of a nurse, have created an affection very like a maternal\none--I am her only support, she leans on me--could I forsake the\nforsaken, and break the bruised reed--No--I would die first! I must--I\nwill go.\"\n\nShe would have added, \"you would very much oblige me by consenting;\" but\nher heart revolted--and irresolutely she wrote something about wishing\nhim happy.--\"Do I not wish all the world well?\" she cried, as she\nsubscribed her name--It was blotted, the letter sealed in a hurry, and\nsent out of her sight; and she began to prepare for her journey.\n\nBy the return of the post she received an answer; it contained some\ncommon-place remarks on her romantic friendship, as he termed it; \"But\nas the physicians advised change of air, he had no objection.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. IX.\n\n\nThere was nothing now to retard their journey; and Mary chose Lisbon\nrather than France, on account of its being further removed from the\nonly person she wished not to see.\n\nThey set off accordingly for Falmouth, in their way to that city. The\njourney was of use to Ann, and Mary's spirits were raised by her\nrecovered looks--She had been in despair--now she gave way to hope, and\nwas intoxicated with it. On ship-board Ann always remained in the cabin;\nthe sight of the water terrified her: on the contrary, Mary, after she\nwas gone to bed, or when she fell asleep in the day, went on deck,\nconversed with the sailors, and surveyed the boundless expanse before\nher with delight. One instant she would regard the ocean, the next the\nbeings who braved its fury. Their insensibility and want of fear, she\ncould not name courage; their thoughtless mirth was quite of an animal\nkind, and their feelings as impetuous and uncertain as the element they\nplowed.\n\nThey had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon,\nand the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits,\nthey were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and\nwhile one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them\none of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the\nIrish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.\n\nSome of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there\nwas a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying\nwith a nun she had entered into conversation with.\n\nOne of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck\nwith awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and\ntenderness flowed from her eyes. My Father, I thank thee! burst from\nher--words were inadequate to express her feelings. Silently, she\nsurveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces,\nstrange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.\n\nIn an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited\neternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any\none she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence\nof her Almighty Friend.\n\nThe arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to\nconduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids.\nUnfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of\nrain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather\ncurtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter\nthemselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way,\nand Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's\nprecautions.\n\nAs is the custom, the rest of the invalids, or lodgers, sent to enquire\nafter their health; and as soon as Ann left her chamber, in which her\ncomplaints seldom confined her the whole day, they came in person to pay\ntheir compliments. Three fashionable females, and two gentlemen; the\none a brother of the eldest of the young ladies, and the other an\ninvalid, who came, like themselves, for the benefit of the air. They\nentered into conversation immediately.\n\nPeople who meet in a strange country, and are all together in a house,\nsoon get acquainted, without the formalities which attend visiting in\nseparate houses, where they are surrounded by domestic friends. Ann was\nparticularly delighted at meeting with agreeable society; a little\nhectic fever generally made her low-spirited in the morning, and lively\nin the evening, when she wished for company. Mary, who only thought of\nher, determined to cultivate their acquaintance, as she knew, that if\nher mind could be diverted, her body might gain strength.\n\nThey were all musical, and proposed having little concerts. One of the\ngentlemen played on the violin, and the other on the german-flute. The\ninstruments were brought in, with all the eagerness that attends putting\na new scheme in execution.\n\nMary had not said much, for she was diffident; she seldom joined in\ngeneral conversations; though her quickness of penetration enabled her\nsoon to enter into the characters of those she conversed with; and her\nsensibility made her desirous of pleasing every human creature. Besides,\nif her mind was not occupied by any particular sorrow, or study, she\ncaught reflected pleasure, and was glad to see others happy, though\ntheir mirth did not interest her.\n\nThis day she was continually thinking of Ann's recovery, and encouraging\nthe cheerful hopes, which though they dissipated the spirits that had\nbeen condensed by melancholy, yet made her wish to be silent. The music,\nmore than the conversation, disturbed her reflections; but not at first.\nThe gentleman who played on the german-flute, was a handsome, well-bred,\nsensible man; and his observations, if not original, were pertinent.\n\nThe other, who had not said much, began to touch the violin, and played\na little Scotch ballad; he brought such a thrilling sound out of the\ninstrument, that Mary started, and looking at him with more attention\nthan she had done before, and saw, in a face rather ugly, strong lines\nof genius. His manners were awkward, that kind of awkwardness which is\noften found in literary men: he seemed a thinker, and delivered his\nopinions in elegant expressions, and musical tones of voice.\n\nWhen the concert was over, they all retired to their apartments. Mary\nalways slept with Ann, as she was subject to terrifying dreams; and\nfrequently in the night was obliged to be supported, to avoid\nsuffocation. They chatted about their new acquaintance in their own\napartment, and, with respect to the gentlemen, differed in opinion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. X.\n\n\nEvery day almost they saw their new acquaintance; and civility produced\nintimacy. Mary sometimes left her friend with them; while she indulged\nherself in viewing new modes of life, and searching out the causes which\nproduced them. She had a metaphysical turn, which inclined her to\nreflect on every object that passed by her; and her mind was not like a\nmirror, which receives every floating image, but does not retain them:\nshe had not any prejudices, for every opinion was examined before it was\nadopted.\n\nThe Roman Catholic ceremonies attracted her attention, and gave rise to\nconversations when they all met; and one of the gentlemen continually\nintroduced deistical notions, when he ridiculed the pageantry they all\nwere surprised at observing. Mary thought of both the subjects, the\nRomish tenets, and the deistical doubts; and though not a sceptic,\nthought it right to examine the evidence on which her faith was built.\nShe read Butler's Analogy, and some other authors: and these researches\nmade her a christian from conviction, and she learned charity,\nparticularly with respect to sectaries; saw that apparently good and\nsolid arguments might take their rise from different points of view; and\nshe rejoiced to find that those she should not concur with had some\nreason on their side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XI.\n\n\nWhen I mentioned the three ladies, I said they were fashionable women;\nand it was all the praise, as a faithful historian, I could bestow on\nthem; the only thing in which they were consistent. I forgot to mention\nthat they were all of one family, a mother, her daughter, and niece. The\ndaughter was sent by her physician, to avoid a northerly winter; the\nmother, her niece, and nephew, accompanied her.\n\nThey were people of rank; but unfortunately, though of an ancient\nfamily, the title had descended to a very remote branch--a branch they\ntook care to be intimate with; and servilely copied the Countess's\nairs. Their minds were shackled with a set of notions concerning\npropriety, the fitness of things for the world's eye, trammels which\nalways hamper weak people. What will the world say? was the first thing\nthat was thought of, when they intended doing any thing they had not\ndone before. Or what would the Countess do on such an occasion? And when\nthis question was answered, the right or wrong was discovered without\nthe trouble of their having any idea of the matter in their own heads.\nThis same Countess was a fine planet, and the satellites observed a most\nharmonic dance around her.\n\nAfter this account it is scarcely necessary to add, that their minds had\nreceived very little cultivation. They were taught French, Italian, and\nSpanish; English was their vulgar tongue. And what did they learn?\nHamlet will tell you--words--words. But let me not forget that they\nsqualled Italian songs in the true _gusto_. Without having any seeds\nsown in their understanding, or the affections of the heart set to work,\nthey were brought out of their nursery, or the place they were secluded\nin, to prevent their faces being common; like blazing stars, to\ncaptivate Lords.\n\nThey were pretty, and hurrying from one party of pleasure to another,\noccasioned the disorder which required change of air. The mother, if we\nexcept her being near twenty years older, was just the same creature;\nand these additional years only served to make her more tenaciously\nadhere to her habits of folly, and decide with stupid gravity, some\ntrivial points of ceremony, as a matter of the last importance; of\nwhich she was a competent judge, from having lived in the fashionable\nworld so long: that world to which the ignorant look up as we do to the\nsun.\n\nIt appears to me that every creature has some notion--or rather relish,\nof the sublime. Riches, and the consequent state, are the sublime of\nweak minds:--These images fill, nay, are too big for their narrow souls.\n\nOne afternoon, which they had engaged to spend together, Ann was so ill,\nthat Mary was obliged to send an apology for not attending the\ntea-table. The apology brought them on the carpet; and the mother, with\na look of solemn importance, turned to the sick man, whose name was\nHenry, and said;\n\n\"Though people of the first fashion are frequently at places of this\nkind, intimate with they know not who; yet I do not choose that my\ndaughter, whose family is so respectable, should be intimate with any\none she would blush to know elsewhere. It is only on that account, for I\nnever suffer her to be with any one but in my company,\" added she,\nsitting more erect; and a smile of self-complacency dressed her\ncountenance.\n\n\"I have enquired concerning these strangers, and find that the one who\nhas the most dignity in her manners, is really a woman of fortune.\"\n\"Lord, mamma, how ill she dresses:\" mamma went on; \"She is a romantic\ncreature, you must not copy her, miss; yet she is an heiress of the\nlarge fortune in ----shire, of which you may remember to have heard the\nCountess speak the night you had on the dancing-dress that was so much\nadmired; but she is married.\"\n\nShe then told them the whole story as she heard it from her maid, who\npicked it out of Mary's servant. \"She is a foolish creature, and this\nfriend that she pays as much attention to as if she was a lady of\nquality, is a beggar.\" \"Well, how strange!\" cried the girls.\n\n\"She is, however, a charming creature,\" said her nephew. Henry sighed,\nand strode across the room once or twice; then took up his violin, and\nplayed the air which first struck Mary; he had often heard her praise\nit.\n\nThe music was uncommonly melodious, \"And came stealing on the senses\nlike the sweet south.\" The well-known sounds reached Mary as she sat by\nher friend--she listened without knowing that she did--and shed tears\nalmost without being conscious of it. Ann soon fell asleep, as she had\ntaken an opiate. Mary, then brooding over her fears, began to imagine\nshe had deceived herself--Ann was still very ill; hope had beguiled many\nheavy hours; yet she was displeased with herself for admitting this\nwelcome guest.--And she worked up her mind to such a degree of anxiety,\nthat she determined, once more, to seek medical aid.\n\nNo sooner did she determine, than she ran down with a discomposed look,\nto enquire of the ladies who she should send for. When she entered the\nroom she could not articulate her fears--it appeared like pronouncing\nAnn's sentence of death; her faultering tongue dropped some broken\nwords, and she remained silent. The ladies wondered that a person of her\nsense should be so little mistress of herself; and began to administer\nsome common-place comfort, as, that it was our duty to submit to the\nwill of Heaven, and the like trite consolations, which Mary did not\nanswer; but waving her hand, with an air of impatience, she exclaimed,\n\"I cannot live without her!--I have no other friend; if I lose her, what\na desart will the world be to me.\" \"No other friend,\" re-echoed they,\n\"have you not a husband?\"\n\nMary shrunk back, and was alternately pale and red. A delicate sense of\npropriety prevented her replying; and recalled her bewildered\nreason.--Assuming, in consequence of her recollection, a more composed\nmanner, she made the intended enquiry, and left the room. Henry's eyes\nfollowed her while the females very freely animadverted on her strange\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XII.\n\n\nThe physician was sent for; his prescription afforded Ann a little\ntemporary relief; and they again joined the circle. Unfortunately, the\nweather happened to be constantly wet for more than a week, and confined\nthem to the house. Ann then found the ladies not so agreeable; when they\nsat whole hours together, the thread-bare topics were exhausted; and,\nbut for cards or music, the long evenings would have been yawned away in\nlistless indolence.\n\nThe bad weather had had as ill an effect on Henry as on Ann. He was\nfrequently very thoughtful, or rather melancholy; this melancholy would\nof itself have attracted Mary's notice, if she had not found his\nconversation so infinitely superior to the rest of the group. When she\nconversed with him, all the faculties of her soul unfolded themselves;\ngenius animated her expressive countenance and the most graceful,\nunaffected gestures gave energy to her discourse.\n\nThey frequently discussed very important subjects, while the rest were\nsinging or playing cards, nor were they observed for doing so, as Henry,\nwhom they all were pleased with, in the way of gallantry shewed them all\nmore attention than her. Besides, as there was nothing alluring in her\ndress or manner, they never dreamt of her being preferred to them.\n\nHenry was a man of learning; he had also studied mankind, and knew many\nof the intricacies of the human heart, from having felt the infirmities\nof his own. His taste was just, as it had a standard--Nature, which he\nobserved with a critical eye. Mary could not help thinking that in his\ncompany her mind expanded, as he always went below the surface. She\nincreased her stock of ideas, and her taste was improved.\n\nHe was also a pious man; his rational religious sentiments received\nwarmth from his sensibility; and, except on very particular occasions,\nkept it in proper bounds; these sentiments had likewise formed his\ntemper; he was gentle, and easily to be intreated. The ridiculous\nceremonies they were every day witness to, led them into what are termed\ngrave subjects, and made him explain his opinions, which, at other\ntimes, he was neither ashamed of, nor unnecessarily brought forward to\nnotice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIII.\n\n\nWhen the weather began to clear up, Mary sometimes rode out alone,\npurposely to view the ruins that still remained of the earthquake: or\nshe would ride to the banks of the Tagus, to feast her eyes with the\nsight of that magnificent river. At other times she would visit the\nchurches, as she was particularly fond of seeing historical paintings.\n\nOne of these visits gave rise to the subject, and the whole party\ndescanted on it; but as the ladies could not handle it well, they soon\nadverted to portraits; and talked of the attitudes and characters in\nwhich they should wish to be drawn. Mary did not fix on one--when\nHenry, with more apparent warmth than usual, said, \"I would give the\nworld for your picture, with the expression I have seen in your face,\nwhen you have been supporting your friend.\"\n\nThis delicate compliment did not gratify her vanity, but it reached her\nheart. She then recollected that she had once sat for her picture--for\nwhom was it designed? For a boy! Her cheeks flushed with indignation, so\nstrongly did she feel an emotion of contempt at having been thrown\naway--given in with an estate.\n\nAs Mary again gave way to hope, her mind was more disengaged; and her\nthoughts were employed about the objects around her.\n\nShe visited several convents, and found that solitude only eradicates\nsome passions, to give strength to others; the most baneful ones. She\nsaw that religion does not consist in ceremonies; and that many prayers\nmay fall from the lips without purifying the heart.\n\nThey who imagine they can be religious without governing their tempers,\nor exercising benevolence in its most extensive sense, must certainly\nallow, that their religious duties are only practiced from selfish\nprinciples; how then can they be called good? The pattern of all\ngoodness went about _doing_ good. Wrapped up in themselves, the nuns\nonly thought of inferior gratifications. And a number of intrigues were\ncarried on to accelerate certain points on which their hearts were\nfixed:\n\nSuch as obtaining offices of trust or authority; or avoiding those that\nwere servile or laborious. In short, when they could be neither wives\nnor mothers, they aimed at being superiors, and became the most selfish\ncreatures in the world: the passions that were curbed gave strength to\nthe appetites, or to those mean passions which only tend to provide for\nthe gratification of them. Was this seclusion from the world? or did\nthey conquer its vanities or avoid its vexations?\n\nIn these abodes the unhappy individual, who, in the first paroxysm of\ngrief flies to them for refuge, finds too late she took a wrong step.\nThe same warmth which determined her will make her repent; and sorrow,\nthe rust of the mind, will never have a chance of being rubbed off by\nsensible conversation, or new-born affections of the heart.\n\nShe will find that those affections that have once been called forth and\nstrengthened by exercise, are only smothered, not killed, by\ndisappointment; and that in one form or other discontent will corrode\nthe heart, and produce those maladies of the imagination, for which\nthere is no specific.\n\nThe community at large Mary disliked; but pitied many of them whose\nprivate distresses she was informed of; and to pity and relieve were the\nsame things with her.\n\nThe exercise of her various virtues gave vigor to her genius, and\ndignity to her mind; she was sometimes inconsiderate, and violent; but\nnever mean or cunning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIV.\n\n\nThe Portuguese are certainly the most uncivilized nation in Europe. Dr.\nJohnson would have said, \"They have the least mind.\". And can such serve\ntheir Creator in spirit and in truth? No, the gross ritual of Romish\nceremonies is all they can comprehend: they can do penance, but not\nconquer their revenge, or lust. Religion, or love, has never humanized\ntheir hearts; they want the vital part; the mere body worships. Taste is\nunknown; Gothic finery, and unnatural decorations, which they term\nornaments, are conspicuous in their churches and dress. Reverence for\nmental excellence is only to be found in a polished nation.\n\nCould the contemplation of such a people gratify Mary's heart? No: she\nturned disgusted from the prospects--turned to a man of refinement.\nHenry had been some time ill and low-spirited; Mary would have been\nattentive to any one in that situation; but to him she was particularly\nso; she thought herself bound in gratitude, on account of his constant\nendeavours to amuse Ann, and prevent her dwelling on the dreary prospect\nbefore her, which sometimes she could not help anticipating with a kind\nof quiet despair.\n\nShe found some excuse for going more frequently into the room they all\nmet in; nay, she avowed her desire to amuse him: offered to read to him,\nand tried to draw him into amusing conversations; and when she was full\nof these little schemes, she looked at him with a degree of tenderness\nthat she was not conscious of. This divided attention was of use to her,\nand prevented her continually thinking of Ann, whose fluctuating\ndisorder often gave rise to false hopes.\n\nA trifling thing occurred now which occasioned Mary some uneasiness. Her\nmaid, a well-looking girl, had captivated the clerk of a neighbouring\ncompting-house. As the match was an advantageous one, Mary could not\nraise any objection to it, though at this juncture it was very\ndisagreeable to her to have a stranger about her person. However, the\ngirl consented to delay the marriage, as she had some affection for her\nmistress; and, besides, looked forward to Ann's death as a time of\nharvest.\n\nHenry's illness was not alarming, it was rather pleasing, as it gave\nMary an excuse to herself for shewing him how much she was interested\nabout him; and giving little artless proofs of affection, which the\npurity of her heart made her never wish to restrain.\n\nThe only visible return he made was not obvious to common observers. He\nwould sometimes fix his eyes on her, and take them off with a sigh that\nwas coughed away; or when he was leisurely walking into the room, and\ndid not expect to see her, he would quicken his steps, and come up to\nher with eagerness to ask some trivial question. In the same style, he\nwould try to detain her when he had nothing to say--or said nothing.\n\nAnn did not take notice of either his or Mary's behaviour, nor did she\nsuspect that he was a favourite, on any other account than his\nappearing neither well nor happy. She had often seen that when a person\nwas unfortunate, Mary's pity might easily be mistaken for love, and,\nindeed, it was a temporary sensation of that kind. Such it was--why it\nwas so, let others define, I cannot argue against instincts. As reason\nis cultivated in man, they are supposed to grow weaker, and this may\nhave given rise to the assertion, \"That as judgment improves, genius\nevaporates.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XV.\n\n\nOne morning they set out to visit the aqueduct; though the day was very\nfine when they left home, a very heavy shower fell before they reached\nit; they lengthened their ride, the clouds dispersed, and the sun came\nfrom behind them uncommonly bright.\n\nMary would fain have persuaded Ann not to have left the carriage; but\nshe was in spirits, and obviated all her objections, and insisted on\nwalking, tho' the ground was damp. But her strength was not equal to her\nspirits; she was soon obliged to return to the carriage so much\nfatigued, that she fainted, and remained insensible a long time.\n\nHenry would have supported her; but Mary would not permit him; her\nrecollection was instantaneous, and she feared sitting on the damp\nground might do him a material injury: she was on that account positive,\nthough the company did not guess the cause of her being so. As to\nherself, she did not fear bodily pain; and, when her mind was agitated,\nshe could endure the greatest fatigue without appearing sensible of it.\n\nWhen Ann recovered, they returned slowly home; she was carried to bed,\nand the next morning Mary thought she observed a visible change for the\nworse. The physician was sent for, who pronounced her to be in the most\nimminent danger.\n\nAll Mary's former fears now returned like a torrent, and carried every\nother care away; she even added to her present anguish by upbraiding\nherself for her late tranquillity--it haunted her in the form of a\ncrime.\n\nThe disorder made the most rapid advances--there was no hope!--Bereft of\nit, Mary again was tranquil; but it was a very different kind of\ntranquillity. She stood to brave the approaching storm, conscious she\nonly could be overwhelmed by it.\n\nShe did not think of Henry, or if her thoughts glanced towards him, it\nwas only to find fault with herself for suffering a thought to have\nstrayed from Ann.--Ann!--this dear friend was soon torn from her--she\ndied suddenly as Mary was assisting her to walk across the room.--The\nfirst string was severed from her heart--and this \"slow, sudden-death\"\ndisturbed her reasoning faculties; she seemed stunned by it; unable to\nreflect, or even to feel her misery.\n\nThe body was stolen out of the house the second night, and Mary refused\nto see her former companions. She desired her maid to conclude her\nmarriage, and request her intended husband to inform her when the first\nmerchantman was to leave the port, as the packet had just sailed, and\nshe determined not to stay in that hated place any longer than was\nabsolutely necessary.\n\nShe then sent to request the ladies to visit her; she wished to avoid a\nparade of grief--her sorrows were her own, and appeared to her not to\nadmit of increase or softening. She was right; the sight of them did not\naffect her, or turn the stream of her sullen sorrow; the black wave\nrolled along in the same course, it was equal to her where she cast her\neyes; all was impenetrable gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVI.\n\n\nSoon after the ladies left her, she received a message from Henry,\nrequesting, as she saw company, to be permitted to visit her: she\nconsented, and he entered immediately, with an unassured pace. She ran\neagerly up to him--saw the tear trembling in his eye, and his\ncountenance softened by the tenderest compassion; the hand which pressed\nhers seemed that of a fellow-creature. She burst into tears; and, unable\nto restrain them, she hid her face with both her hands; these tears\nrelieved her, (she had before had a difficulty in breathing,) and she\nsat down by him more composed than she had appeared since Ann's death;\nbut her conversation was incoherent.\n\nShe called herself \"a poor disconsolate creature!\"--\"Mine is a selfish\ngrief,\" she exclaimed--\"Yet; Heaven is my witness, I do not wish her\nback now she has reached those peaceful mansions, where the weary rest.\nHer pure spirit is happy; but what a wretch am I!\"\n\nHenry forgot his cautious reserve. \"Would you allow me to call you\nfriend?\" said he in a hesitating voice. \"I feel, dear girl, the tendered\ninterest in whatever concerns thee.\" His eyes spoke the rest. They were\nboth silent a few moments; then Henry resumed the conversation. \"I have\nalso been acquainted with grief! I mourn the loss of a woman who was not\nworthy of my regard. Let me give thee some account of the man who now\nsolicits thy friendship; and who, from motives of the purest\nbenevolence, wishes to give comfort to thy wounded heart.\"\n\n\"I have myself,\" said he, mournfully, \"shaken hands with happiness, and\nam dead to the world; I wait patiently for my dissolution; but, for\nthee, Mary, there may be many bright days in store.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" replied she, in a peevish tone, as if he had insulted her\nby the supposition; her feelings were so much in unison with his, that\nshe was in love with misery.\n\nHe smiled at her impatience, and went on. \"My father died before I knew\nhim, and my mother was so attached to my eldest brother, that she took\nvery little pains to fit me for the profession to which I was destined:\nand, may I tell thee, I left my family, and, in many different stations,\nrambled about the world; saw mankind in every rank of life; and, in\norder to be independent, exerted those talents Nature has given me:\nthese exertions improved my understanding; and the miseries I was\nwitness to, gave a keener edge to my sensibility. My constitution is\nnaturally weak; and, perhaps, two or three lingering disorders in my\nyouth, first gave me a habit of reflecting, and enabled me to obtain\nsome dominion over my passions. At least,\" added he, stifling a sigh,\n\"over the violent ones, though I fear, refinement and reflection only\nrenders the tender ones more tyrannic.\n\n\"I have told you already I have been in love, and disappointed--the\nobject is now no more; let her faults sleep with her! Yet this passion\nhas pervaded my whole soul, and mixed itself with all my affections and\npursuits.--I am not peacefully indifferent; yet it is only to my violin\nI tell the sorrows I now confide with thee. The object I loved forfeited\nmy esteem; yet, true to the sentiment, my fancy has too frequently\ndelighted to form a creature that I could love, that could convey to my\nsoul sensations which the gross part of mankind have not any conception\nof.\"\n\nHe stopped, as Mary seemed lost in thought; but as she was still in a\nlistening attitude, continued his little narrative. \"I kept up an\nirregular correspondence with my mother; my brother's extravagance and\ningratitude had almost broken her heart, and made her feel something\nlike a pang of remorse, on account of her behaviour to me. I hastened to\ncomfort her--and was a comfort to her.\n\n\"My declining health prevented my taking orders, as I had intended; but\nI with warmth entered into literary pursuits; perhaps my heart, not\nhaving an object, made me embrace the substitute with more eagerness.\nBut, do not imagine I have always been a die-away swain. No: I have\nfrequented the cheerful haunts of men, and wit!--enchanting wit! has\nmade many moments fly free from care. I am too fond of the elegant arts;\nand woman--lovely woman! thou hast charmed me, though, perhaps, it would\nnot be easy to find one to whom my reason would allow me to be constant.\n\n\"I have now only to tell you, that my mother insisted on my spending\nthis winter in a warmer climate; and I fixed on Lisbon, as I had before\nvisited the Continent.\" He then looked Mary full in the face; and, with\nthe most insinuating accents, asked \"if he might hope for her\nfriendship? If she would rely on him as if he was her father; and that\nthe tenderest father could not more anxiously interest himself in the\nfate of a darling child, than he did in her's.\"\n\nSuch a crowd of thoughts all at once rushed into Mary's mind, that she\nin vain attempted to express the sentiments which were most predominant.\nHer heart longed to receive a new guest; there was a void in it:\naccustomed to have some one to love, she was alone, and comfortless, if\nnot engrossed by a particular affection.\n\nHenry saw her distress, and not to increase it, left the room. He had\nexerted himself to turn her thoughts into a new channel, and had\nsucceeded; she thought of him till she began to chide herself for\ndefrauding the dead, and, determining to grieve for Ann, she dwelt on\nHenry's misfortunes and ill health; and the interest he took in her fate\nwas a balm to her sick mind. She did not reason on the subject; but she\nfelt he was attached to her: lost in this delirium, she never asked\nherself what kind of an affection she had for him, or what it tended to;\nnor did she know that love and friendship are very distinct; she thought\nwith rapture, that there was one person in the world who had an\naffection for her, and that person she admired--had a friendship for.\n\nHe had called her his dear girl; the words might have fallen from him by\naccident; but they did not fall to the ground. My child! His child,\nwhat an association of ideas! If I had had a father, such a father!--She\ncould not dwell on the thoughts, the wishes which obtruded themselves.\nHer mind was unhinged, and passion unperceived filled her whole soul.\nLost, in waking dreams, she considered and reconsidered Henry's account\nof himself; till she actually thought she would tell Ann--a bitter\nrecollection then roused her out of her reverie; and aloud she begged\nforgiveness of her.\n\nBy these kind of conflicts the day was lengthened; and when she went to\nbed, the night passed away in feverish slumbers; though they did not\nrefresh her, she was spared the labour of thinking, of restraining her\nimagination; it sported uncontrouled; but took its colour from her\nwaking train of thoughts. One instant she was supporting her dying\nmother; then Ann was breathing her last, and Henry was comforting her.\n\nThe unwelcome light visited her languid eyes; yet, I must tell the\ntruth, she thought she should see Henry, and this hope set her spirits\nin motion: but they were quickly depressed by her maid, who came to tell\nher that she had heard of a vessel on board of which she could be\naccommodated, and that there was to be another female passenger on\nboard, a vulgar one; but perhaps she would be more useful on that\naccount--Mary did not want a companion.\n\nAs she had given orders for her passage to be engaged in the first\nvessel that sailed, she could not now retract; and must prepare for the\nlonely voyage, as the Captain intended taking advantage of the first\nfair wind. She had too much strength of mind to waver in her\ndetermination but to determine wrung her very heart, opened all her old\nwounds, and made them bleed afresh. What was she to do? where go? Could\nshe set a seal to a hasty vow, and tell a deliberate lie; promise to\nlove one man, when the image of another was ever present to her--her\nsoul revolted. \"I might gain the applause of the world by such mock\nheroism; but should I not forfeit my own? forfeit thine, my father!\"\n\nThere is a solemnity in the shortest ejaculation, which, for a while,\nstills the tumult of passion. Mary's mind had been thrown off its poise;\nher devotion had been, perhaps, more fervent for some time past; but\nless regular. She forgot that happiness was not to be found on earth,\nand built a terrestrial paradise liable to be destroyed by the first\nserious thought: when, she reasoned she became inexpressibly sad, to\nrender life bearable she gave way to fancy--this was madness.\n\nIn a few days she must again go to sea; the weather was very\ntempestuous--what of that, the tempest in her soul rendered every other\ntrifling--it was not the contending elements, but _herself_ she feared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVII.\n\n\nIn order to gain strength to support the expected interview, she went\nout in a carriage. The day was fine; but all nature was to her a\nuniversal blank; she could neither enjoy it, nor weep that she could\nnot. She passed by the ruins of an old monastery on a very high hill she\ngot out to walk amongst the ruins; the wind blew violently, she did not\navoid its fury, on the contrary, wildly bid it blow on, and seemed glad\nto contend with it, or rather walk against it. Exhausted she returned to\nthe carriage was soon at home, and in the old room.\n\nHenry started at the sight of her altered appearance; the day before her\ncomplexion had been of the most pallid hue; but now her cheeks were\nflushed, and her eyes enlivened with a false vivacity, an unusual fire.\nHe was not well, his illness was apparent in his countenance, and he\nowned he had not closed his eyes all night; this roused her dormant\ntenderness, she forgot they were so soon to part-engrossed by the\npresent happiness of seeing, of hearing him.\n\nOnce or twice she essayed to tell him that she was, in a few days, to\ndepart; but she could not; she was irresolute; it will do to-morrow;\nshould the wind change they could not sail in such a hurry; thus she\nthought, and insensibly grew more calm. The Ladies prevailed on her to\nspend the evening with them; but she retired very early to rest, and sat\non the side of her bed several hours, then threw herself on it, and\nwaited for the dreaded to-morrow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XVIII.\n\n\nThe ladies heard that her servant was to be married that day, and that\nshe was to sail in the vessel which was then clearing out at the\nCustom-house. Henry heard, but did not make any remarks; and Mary called\nup all her fortitude to support her, and enable her to hide from the\nfemales her internal struggles. She durst not encounter Henry's glances\nwhen she found he had been informed of her intention; and, trying to\ndraw a veil over her wretched state of mind, she talked incessantly, she\nknew not what; flashes of wit burst from her, and when she began to\nlaugh she could not stop herself.\n\nHenry smiled at some of her sallies, and looked at her with such\nbenignity and compassion, that he recalled her scattered thoughts; and,\nthe ladies going to dress for dinner, they were left alone; and remained\nsilent a few moments: after the noisy conversation it appeared solemn.\nHenry began. \"You are going, Mary, and going by yourself; your mind is\nnot in a state to be left to its own operations--yet I cannot, dissuade\nyou; if I attempted to do it, I should ill deserve the title I wish to\nmerit. I only think of your happiness; could I obey the strongest\nimpulse of my heart, I should accompany thee to England; but such a step\nmight endanger your future peace.\"\n\nMary, then, with all the frankness which marked her character, explained\nher situation to him and mentioned her fatal tie with such disgust that\nhe trembled for her. \"I cannot see him; he is not the man formed for me\nto love!\" Her delicacy did not restrain her, for her dislike to her\nhusband had taken root in her mind long before she knew Henry. Did she\nnot fix on Lisbon rather than France on purpose to avoid him? and if Ann\nhad been in tolerable health she would have flown with her to some\nremote corner to have escaped from him.\n\n\"I intend,\" said Henry, \"to follow you in the next packet; where shall I\nhear of your health?\" \"Oh! let me hear of thine,\" replied Mary. \"I am\nwell, very well; but thou art very ill--thy health is in the most\nprecarious state.\" She then mentioned her intention of going to Ann's\nrelations. \"I am her representative, I have duties to fulfil for her:\nduring my voyage I have time enough for reflection; though I think I\nhave already determined.\"\n\n\"Be not too hasty, my child,\" interrupted Henry; \"far be it from me to\npersuade thee to do violence to thy feelings--but consider that all thy\nfuture life may probably take its colour from thy present mode of\nconduct. Our affections as well as our sentiments are fluctuating; you\nwill not perhaps always either think or feel as you do at present: the\nobject you now shun may appear in a different light.\" He paused. \"In\nadvising thee in this style, I have only thy good at heart, Mary.\"\n\nShe only answered to expostulate. \"My affections are involuntary--yet\nthey can only be fixed by reflection, and when they are they make quite\na part of my soul, are interwoven in it, animate my actions, and form\nmy taste: certain qualities are calculated to call forth my sympathies,\nand make me all I am capable of being. The governing affection gives its\nstamp to the rest--because I am capable of loving one, I have that kind\nof charity to all my fellow-creatures which is not easily provoked.\nMilton has asserted, That earthly love is the scale by which to heavenly\nwe may ascend.\"\n\nShe went on with eagerness. \"My opinions on some subjects are not\nwavering; my pursuit through life has ever been the same: in solitude\nwere my sentiments formed; they are indelible, and nothing can efface\nthem but death--No, death itself cannot efface them, or my soul must be\ncreated afresh, and not improved. Yet a little while am I parted from\nmy Ann--I could not exist without the hope of seeing her again--I could\nnot bear to think that time could wear away an affection that was\nfounded on what is not liable to perish; you might as well attempt to\npersuade me that my soul is matter, and that its feelings arose from\ncertain modifications of it.\"\n\n\"Dear enthusiastic creature,\" whispered Henry, \"how you steal into my\nsoul.\" She still continued. \"The same turn of mind which leads me to\nadore the Author of all Perfection--which leads me to conclude that he\nonly can fill my soul; forces me to admire the faint image-the shadows\nof his attributes here below; and my imagination gives still bolder\nstrokes to them. I knew I am in some degree under the influence of a\ndelusion--but does not this strong delusion prove that I myself 'am _of\nsubtiler essence than the trodden clod_' these flights of the\nimagination point to futurity; I cannot banish them. Every cause in\nnature produces an effect; and am I an exception to the general rule?\nhave I desires implanted in me only to make me miserable? will they\nnever be gratified? shall I never be happy? My feelings do not accord\nwith the notion of solitary happiness. In a state of bliss, it will be\nthe society of beings we can love, without the alloy that earthly\ninfirmities mix with our best affections, that will constitute great\npart of our happiness.\n\n\"With these notions can I conform to the maxims of worldly wisdom? can\nI listen to the cold dictates of worldly prudence and bid my tumultuous\npassions cease to vex me, be still, find content in grovelling pursuits,\nand the admiration of the misjudging crowd, when it is only one I wish\nto please--one who could be all the world to me. Argue not with me, I am\nbound by human ties; but did my spirit ever promise to love, or could I\nconsider when forced to bind myself--to take a vow, that at the awful\nday of judgment I must give an account of. My conscience does not smite\nme, and that Being who is greater than the internal monitor, may approve\nof what the world condemns; sensible that in Him I live, could I brave\nHis presence, or hope in solitude to find peace, if I acted contrary to\nconviction, that the world might approve of my conduct--what could the\nworld give to compensate for my own esteem? it is ever hostile and armed\nagainst the feeling heart!\n\n\"Riches and honours await me, and the cold moralist might desire me to\nsit down and enjoy them--I cannot conquer my feelings, and till I do,\nwhat are these baubles to me? you may tell me I follow a fleeting good,\nan _ignis fatuus_; but this chase, these struggles prepare me for\neternity--when I no longer see through a glass darkly I shall not reason\nabout, but _feel_ in what happiness consists.\"\n\nHenry had not attempted to interrupt her; he saw she was determined, and\nthat these sentiments were not the effusion of the moment, but well\ndigested ones, the result of strong affections, a high sense of honour,\nand respect for the source of all virtue and truth. He was startled, if\nnot entirely convinced by her arguments; indeed her voice, her gestures\nwere all persuasive.\n\nSome one now entered the room; he looked an answer to her long harangue;\nit was fortunate for him, or he might have been led to say what in a\ncooler moment he had determined to conceal; but were words necessary to\nreveal it? He wished not to influence her conduct--vain precaution; she\nknew she was beloved; and could she forget that such a man loved her, or\nrest satisfied with any inferior gratification. When passion first\nenters the heart, it is only a return of affection that is sought after,\nand every other remembrance and wish is blotted out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XIX.\n\n\nTwo days passed away without any particular conversation; Henry, trying\nto be indifferent, or to appear so, was more assiduous than ever. The\nconflict was too violent for his present state of health; the spirit was\nwilling, but the body suffered; he lost his appetite, and looked\nwretchedly; his spirits were calmly low--the world seemed to fade\naway--what was that world to him that Mary did not inhabit; she lived\nnot for him.\n\nHe was mistaken; his affection was her only support; without this dear\nprop she had sunk into the grave of her lost--long-loved friend;--his\nattention snatched her from despair. Inscrutable are the ways of\nHeaven!\n\nThe third day Mary was desired to prepare herself; for if the wind\ncontinued in the same point, they should set sail the next evening. She\ntried to prepare her mind, and her efforts were not useless she appeared\nless agitated than could have been expected, and talked of her voyage\nwith composure. On great occasions she was generally calm and collected,\nher resolution would brace her unstrung nerves; but after the victory\nshe had no triumph; she would sink into a state of moping melancholy,\nand feel ten-fold misery when the heroic enthusiasm was over.\n\nThe morning of the day fixed on for her departure she was alone with\nHenry only a few moments, and an awkward kind of formality made them\nslip away without their having said much to each other. Henry was\nafraid to discover his passion, or give any other name to his regard but\nfriendship; yet his anxious solicitude for her welfare was ever breaking\nout-while she as artlessly expressed again and again, her fears with\nrespect to his declining health.\n\n\"We shall soon meet,\" said he, with a faint smile; Mary smiled too; she\ncaught the sickly beam; it was still fainter by being reflected, and not\nknowing what she wished to do, started up and left the room. When she\nwas alone she regretted she had left him so precipitately. \"The few\nprecious moments I have thus thrown away may never return,\" she\nthought-the reflection led to misery.\n\nShe waited for, nay, almost wished for the summons to depart. She could\nnot avoid spending the intermediate time with the ladies and Henry; and\nthe trivial conversations she was obliged to bear a part in harassed her\nmore than can be well conceived.\n\nThe summons came, and the whole party attended her to the vessel. For a\nwhile the remembrance of Ann banished her regret at parting with Henry,\nthough his pale figure pressed on her sight; it may seem a paradox, but\nhe was more present to her when she sailed; her tears then were all his\nown.\n\n\"My poor Ann!\" thought Mary, \"along this road we came, and near this\nspot you called me your guardian angel--and now I leave thee here! ah!\nno, I do not--thy spirit is not confined to its mouldering tenement!\nTell me, thou soul of her I love, tell me, ah! whither art thou fled?\"\nAnn occupied her until they reached the ship.\n\nThe anchor was weighed. Nothing can be more irksome than waiting to say\nfarewel. As the day was serene, they accompanied her a little way, and\nthen got into the boat; Henry was the last; he pressed her hand, it had\nnot any life in it; she leaned over the side of the ship without looking\nat the boat, till it was so far distant, that she could not see the\ncountenances of those that were in it: a mist spread itself over her\nsight--she longed to exchange one look--tried to recollect the\nlast;--the universe contained no being but Henry!--The grief of parting\nwith him had swept all others clean away. Her eyes followed the keel of\nthe boat, and when she could no longer perceive its traces: she looked\nround on the wide waste of waters, thought of the precious moments\nwhich had been stolen from the waste of murdered time.\n\nShe then descended into the cabin, regardless of the surrounding\nbeauties of nature, and throwing herself on her bed in the little hole\nwhich was called the state-room--she wished to forget her existence. On\nthis bed she remained two days, listening to the dashing waves, unable\nto close her eyes. A small taper made the darkness visible; and the\nthird night, by its glimmering light, she wrote the following fragment.\n\n\"Poor solitary wretch that I am; here alone do I listen to the whistling\nwinds and dashing waves;--on no human support can I rest--when not lost\nto hope I found pleasure in the society of those rough beings; but now\nthey appear not like my fellow creatures; no social ties draw me to\nthem. How long, how dreary has this day been; yet I scarcely wish it\nover--for what will to-morrow bring--to-morrow, and to-morrow will only\nbe marked with unvaried characters of wretchedness.--Yet surely, I am\nnot alone!\"\n\nHer moistened eyes were lifted up to heaven; a crowd of thoughts darted\ninto her mind, and pressing her hand against her forehead, as if to bear\nthe intellectual weight, she tried, but tried in vain, to arrange them.\n\"Father of Mercies, compose this troubled spirit: do I indeed wish it to\nbe composed--to forget my Henry?\" the _my_, the pen was directly drawn\nacross in an agony.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XX.\n\n\nThe mate of the ship, who heard her stir, came to offer her some\nrefreshment; and she, who formerly received every offer of kindness or\ncivility with pleasure, now shrunk away disgusted: peevishly she desired\nhim not to disturb her; but the words were hardly articulated when her\nheart smote her, she called him back, and requested something to drink.\nAfter drinking it, fatigued by her mental exertions, she fell into a\ndeath-like slumber, which lasted some hours; but did not refresh her, on\nthe contrary, she awoke languid and stupid.\n\nThe wind still continued contrary; a week, a dismal week, had she\nstruggled with her sorrows; and the struggle brought on a slow fever,\nwhich sometimes gave her false spirits.\n\nThe winds then became very tempestuous, the Great Deep was troubled, and\nall the passengers appalled. Mary then left her bed, and went on deck,\nto survey the contending elements: the scene accorded with the present\nstate of her soul; she thought in a few hours I may go home; the\nprisoner may be released. The vessel rose on a wave and descended into a\nyawning gulph--Not slower did her mounting soul return to earth,\nfor--Ah! her treasure and her heart was there. The squalls rattled\namongst the sails, which were quickly taken down; the wind would then\ndie away, and the wild undirected waves rushed on every side with a\ntremendous roar. In a little vessel in the midst of such a storm she\nwas not dismayed; she felt herself independent.\n\nJust then one of the crew perceived a signal of distress; by the help of\na glass he could plainly discover a small vessel dismasted, drifted\nabout, for the rudder had been broken by the violence of the storm.\nMary's thoughts were now all engrossed by the crew on the brink of\ndestruction. They bore down to the wreck; they reached it, and hailed\nthe trembling wretches; at the sound of the friendly greeting, loud\ncries of tumultuous joy were mixed with the roaring of the waves, and\nwith ecstatic transport they leaped on the shattered deck, launched\ntheir boat in a moment, and committed themselves to the mercy of the\nsea. Stowed between two casks, and leaning on a sail, she watched the\nboat, and when a wave intercepted it from her view--she ceased to\nbreathe, or rather held her breath until it rose again.\n\nAt last the boat arrived safe along-side the ship, and Mary caught the\npoor trembling wretches as they stumbled into it, and joined them in\nthanking that gracious Being, who though He had not thought fit to still\nthe raging of the sea, had afforded them unexpected succour.\n\nAmongst the wretched crew was one poor woman, who fainted when she was\nhauled on board: Mary undressed her, and when she had recovered, and\nsoothed her, left her to enjoy the rest she required to recruit her\nstrength, which fear had quite exhausted. She returned again to view the\nangry deep; and when she gazed on its perturbed state, she thought of\nthe Being who rode on the wings of the wind, and stilled the noise of\nthe sea; and the madness of the people--He only could speak peace to\nher troubled spirit! she grew more calm; the late transaction had\ngratified her benevolence, and stole her out of herself.\n\nOne of the sailors, happening to say to another, \"that he believed the\nworld was going to be at an end;\" this observation led her into a new\ntrain of thoughts: some of Handel's sublime compositions occurred to\nher, and she sung them to the grand accompaniment. The Lord God\nOmnipotent reigned, and would reign for ever, and ever!--Why then did\nshe fear the sorrows that were passing away, when she knew that He would\nbind up the broken-hearted, and receive those who came out of great\ntribulation. She retired to her cabin; and wrote in the little book that\nwas now her only confident. It was after midnight.\n\n\"At this solemn hour, the great day of judgment fills my thoughts; the\nday of retribution, when the secrets of all hearts will be revealed;\nwhen all worldly distinctions will fade away, and be no more seen. I\nhave not words to express the sublime images which the bare\ncontemplation of this awful day raises in my mind. Then, indeed, the\nLord Omnipotent will reign, and He will wipe the tearful eye, and\nsupport the trembling heart--yet a little while He hideth his face, and\nthe dun shades of sorrow, and the thick clouds of folly separate us from\nour God; but when the glad dawn of an eternal day breaks, we shall know\neven as we are known. Here we walk by faith, and not by sight; and we\nhave this alternative, either to enjoy the pleasures of life which are\nbut for a season, or look forward to the prize of our high calling, and\nwith fortitude, and that wisdom which is from above, endeavour to bear\nthe warfare of life. We know that many run the race; but he that\nstriveth obtaineth the crown of victory. Our race is an arduous one! How\nmany are betrayed by traitors lodged in their own breasts, who wear the\ngarb of Virtue, and are so near akin; we sigh to think they should ever\nlead into folly, and slide imperceptibly into vice. Surely any thing\nlike happiness is madness! Shall probationers of an hour presume to\npluck the fruit of immortality, before they have conquered death? it is\nguarded, when the great day, to which I allude, arrives, the way will\nagain be opened. Ye dear delusions, gay deceits, farewel! and yet I\ncannot banish ye for ever; still does my panting soul push forward, and\nlive in futurity, in the deep shades o'er which darkness hangs.--I try\nto pierce the gloom, and find a resting-place, where my thirst of\nknowledge will be gratified, and my ardent affections find an object to\nfix them. Every thing material must change; happiness and this\nfluctating principle is not compatible. Eternity, immateriality, and\nhappiness,--what are ye? How shall I grasp the mighty and fleeting\nconceptions ye create?\"\n\nAfter writing, serenely she delivered her soul into the hands of the\nFather of Spirits; and slept in peace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXI.\n\n\nMary rose early, refreshed by the seasonable rest, and went to visit the\npoor woman, whom she found quite recovered: and, on enquiry, heard that\nshe had lately buried her husband, a common sailor; and that her only\nsurviving child had been washed over-board the day before. Full of her\nown danger, she scarcely thought of her child till that was over; and\nthen she gave way to boisterous emotions.\n\nMary endeavoured to calm her at first, by sympathizing with her; and she\ntried to point out the only solid source of comfort but in doing this\nshe encountered many difficulties; she found her grossly ignorant, yet\nshe did not despair: and as the poor creature could not receive comfort\nfrom the operations of her own mind, she laboured to beguile the hours,\nwhich grief made heavy, by adapting her conversation to her capacity.\n\nThere are many minds that only receive impressions through the medium of\nthe senses: to them did Mary address herself; she made her some\npresents, and promised to assist her when they should arrive in England.\nThis employment roused her out of her late stupor, and again set the\nfaculties of her soul in motion; made the understanding contend with the\nimagination, and the heart throbbed not so irregularly during the\ncontention. How short-lived was the calm! when the English coast was\ndescried, her sorrows returned with redoubled vigor.--She was to visit\nand comfort the mother of her lost friend--And where then should she\ntake up her residence? These thoughts suspended the exertions of her\nunderstanding; abstracted reflections gave way to alarming\napprehensions; and tenderness undermined fortitude.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXII.\n\n\nIn England then landed the forlorn wanderer. She looked round for some\nfew moments--her affections were not attracted to any particular part of\nthe Island. She knew none of the inhabitants of the vast city to which\nshe was going: the mass of buildings appeared to her a huge body without\nan informing soul. As she passed through the streets in an\nhackney-coach, disgust and horror alternately filled her mind. She met\nsome women drunk; and the manners of those who attacked the sailors,\nmade her shrink into herself, and exclaim, are these my fellow\ncreatures!\n\nDetained by a number of carts near the water-side, for she came up the\nriver in the vessel, not having reason to hasten on shore, she saw\nvulgarity, dirt, and vice--her soul sickened; this was the first time\nsuch complicated misery obtruded itself on her sight.--Forgetting her\nown griefs, she gave the world a much indebted tear; mourned for a world\nin ruins. She then perceived, that great part of her comfort must arise\nfrom viewing the smiling face of nature, and be reflected from the view\nof innocent enjoyments: she was fond of seeing animals play, and could\nnot bear to see her own species sink below them.\n\nIn a little dwelling in one of the villages near London, lived the\nmother of Ann; two of her children still remained with her; but they did\nnot resemble Ann. To her house Mary directed the coach, and told the\nunfortunate mother of her loss. The poor woman, oppressed by it, and her\nmany other cares, after an inundation of tears, began to enumerate all\nher past misfortunes, and present cares. The heavy tale lasted until\nmidnight, and the impression it made on Mary's mind was so strong, that\nit banished sleep till towards morning; when tired nature sought\nforgetfulness, and the soul ceased to ruminate about many things.\n\nShe sent for the poor woman they took up at sea, provided her a lodging,\nand relieved her present necessities. A few days were spent in a kind of\nlistless way; then the mother of Ann began to enquire when she thought\nof returning home. She had hitherto treated her with the greatest\nrespect, and concealed her wonder at Mary's choosing a remote room in\nthe house near the garden, and ordering some alterations to be made, as\nif she intended living in it.\n\nMary did not choose to explain herself; had Ann lived, it is probable\nshe would never have loved Henry so fondly; but if she had, she could\nnot have talked of her passion to any human creature. She deliberated,\nand at last informed the family, that she had a reason for not living\nwith her husband, which must some time remain a secret--they stared--Not\nlive with him! how will you live then? This was a question she could not\nanswer; she had only about eighty pounds remaining, of the money she\ntook with her to Lisbon; when it was exhausted where could she get more?\nI will work, she cried, do any thing rather than be a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIII.\n\n\nUnhappy, she wandered about the village, and relieved the poor; it was\nthe only employment that eased her aching heart; she became more\nintimate with misery--the misery that rises from poverty and the want of\neducation. She was in the vicinity of a great city; the vicious poor in\nand about it must ever grieve a benevolent contemplative mind.\n\nOne evening a man who stood weeping in a little lane, near the house she\nresided in, caught her eye. She accosted him; in a confused manner, he\ninformed her, that his wife was dying, and his children crying for the\nbread he could not earn. Mary desired to be conducted to his\nhabitation; it was not very distant, and was the upper room in an old\nmansion-house, which had been once the abode of luxury. Some tattered\nshreds of rich hangings still remained, covered with cobwebs and filth;\nround the ceiling, through which the rain drop'd, was a beautiful\ncornice mouldering; and a spacious gallery was rendered dark by the\nbroken windows being blocked up; through the apertures the wind forced\nits way in hollow sounds, and reverberated along the former scene of\nfestivity.\n\nIt was crowded with inhabitants: som were scolding, others swearing, or\nsinging indecent songs. What a sight for Mary! Her blood ran cold; yet\nshe had sufficient resolution to mount to the top of the house. On the\nfloor, in one corner of a very small room, lay an emaciated figure of a\nwoman; a window over her head scarcely admitted any light, for the\nbroken panes were stuffed with dirty rags. Near her were five children,\nall young, and covered with dirt; their sallow cheeks, and languid eyes,\nexhibited none of the charms of childhood. Some were fighting, and\nothers crying for food; their yells were mixed with their mother's\ngroans, and the wind which rushed through the passage. Mary was\npetrified; but soon assuming more courage, approached the bed, and,\nregardless of the surrounding nastiness, knelt down by the poor wretch,\nand breathed the most poisonous air; for the unfortunate creature was\ndying of a putrid fever, the consequence of dirt and want.\n\nTheir state did not require much explanation. Mary sent the husband for\na poor neighbour, whom she hired to nurse the woman, and take care of\nthe children; and then went herself to buy them some necessaries at a\nshop not far distant. Her knowledge of physic had enabled her to\nprescribe for the woman; and she left the house, with a mixture of\nhorror and satisfaction.\n\nShe visited them every day, and procured them every comfort; contrary to\nher expectation, the woman began to recover; cleanliness and wholesome\nfood had a wonderful effect; and Mary saw her rising as it were from the\ngrave. Not aware of the danger she ran into, she did not think of it\ntill she perceived she had caught the fever. It made such an alarming\nprogress, that she was prevailed on to send for a physician; but the\ndisorder was so violent, that for some days it baffled his skill; and\nMary felt not her danger, as she was delirious. After the crisis, the\nsymptoms were more favourable, and she slowly recovered, without\nregaining much strength or spirits; indeed they were intolerably low:\nshe wanted a tender nurse.\n\nFor some time she had observed, that she was not treated with the same\nrespect as formerly; her favors were forgotten when no more were\nexpected. This ingratitude hurt her, as did a similar instance in the\nwoman who came out of the ship. Mary had hitherto supported her; as her\nfinances were growing low, she hinted to her, that she ought to try to\nearn her own subsistence: the woman in return loaded her with abuse.\n\nTwo months were elapsed; she had not seen, or heard from Henry. He was\nsick--nay, perhaps had forgotten her; all the world was dreary, and all\nthe people ungrateful.\n\nShe sunk into apathy, and endeavouring to rouse herself out of it, she\nwrote in her book another fragment:\n\n\"Surely life is a dream, a frightful one! and after those rude,\ndisjointed images are fled, will light ever break in? Shall I ever feel\njoy? Do all suffer like me; or am I framed so as to be particularly\nsusceptible of misery? It is true, I have experienced the most rapturous\nemotions--short-lived delight!--ethereal beam, which only serves to shew\nmy present misery--yet lie still, my throbbing heart, or burst; and my\nbrain--why dost thou whirl about at such a terrifying rate? why do\nthoughts so rapidly rush into my mind, and yet when they disappear\nleave such deep traces? I could almost wish for the madman's happiness,\nand in a strong imagination lose a sense of woe.\n\n\"Oh! reason, thou boasted guide, why desert me, like the world, when I\nmost need thy assistance! Canst thou not calm this internal tumult, and\ndrive away the death-like sadness which presses so sorely on me,--a\nsadness surely very nearly allied to despair. I am now the prey of\napathy--I could wish for the former storms! a ray of hope sometimes\nillumined my path; I had a pursuit; but now _it visits not my haunts\nforlorn_. Too well have I loved my fellow creatures! I have been wounded\nby ingratitude; from every one it has something of the serpent's tooth.\n\n\"When overwhelmed by sorrow, I have met unkindness; I looked for some\none to have pity on me; but found none!--The healing balm of sympathy is\ndenied; I weep, a solitary wretch, and the hot tears scald my cheeks. I\nhave not the medicine of life, the dear chimera I have so often chased,\na friend. Shade of my loved Ann! dost thou ever visit thy poor Mary?\nRefined spirit, thou wouldst weep, could angels weep, to see her\nstruggling with passions she cannot subdue; and feelings which corrode\nher small portion of comfort!\"\n\nShe could not write any more; she wished herself far distant from all\nhuman society; a thick gloom spread itself over her mind: but did not\nmake her forget the very beings she wished to fly from. She sent for the\npoor woman she found in the garret; gave her money to clothe herself\nand children, and buy some furniture for a little hut, in a large\ngarden, the master of which agreed to employ her husband, who had been\nbred a gardener. Mary promised to visit the family, and see their new\nabode when she was able to go out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIV.\n\n\nMary still continued weak and low, though it was spring, and all nature\nbegan to look gay; with more than usual brightness the sun shone, and a\nlittle robin which she had cherished during the winter sung one of his\nbest songs. The family were particularly civil this fine morning, and\ntried to prevail on her to walk out. Any thing like kindness melted her;\nshe consented.\n\nSofter emotions banished her melancholy, and she directed her steps to\nthe habitation she had rendered comfortable.\n\nEmerging out of a dreary chamber, all nature looked cheerful; when she\nhad last walked out, snow covered the ground, and bleak winds pierced\nher through and through: now the hedges were green, the blossoms adorned\nthe trees, and the birds sung. She reached the dwelling, without being\nmuch exhausted and while she rested there, observed the children\nsporting on the grass, with improved complexions. The mother with tears\nthanked her deliverer, and pointed out her comforts. Mary's tears flowed\nnot only from sympathy, but a complication of feelings and recollections\nthe affections which bound her to her fellow creatures began again to\nplay, and reanimated nature. She observed the change in herself, tried\nto account for it, and wrote with her pencil a rhapsody on sensibility.\n\n\"Sensibility is the most exquisite feeling of which the human soul is\nsusceptible: when it pervades us, we feel happy; and could it last\nunmixed, we might form some conjecture of the bliss of those\nparadisiacal days, when the obedient passions were under the dominion of\nreason, and the impulses of the heart did not need correction.\n\n\"It is this quickness, this delicacy of feeling, which enables us to\nrelish the sublime touches of the poet, and the painter; it is this,\nwhich expands the soul, gives an enthusiastic greatness, mixed with\ntenderness, when we view the magnificent objects of nature; or hear of a\ngood action. The same effect we experience in the spring, when we hail\nthe returning sun, and the consequent renovation of nature; when the\nflowers unfold themselves, and exhale their sweets, and the voice of\nmusic is heard in the land. Softened by tenderness; the soul is\ndisposed to be virtuous. Is any sensual gratification to be compared to\nthat of feelings the eves moistened after having comforted the\nunfortunate?\n\n\"Sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these\nraptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by\nwhat strikes his gross senses; the delicate embellishments of nature\nescape his notice; as do the gentle and interesting affections.--But it\nis only to be felt; it escapes discussion.\"\n\nShe then returned home, and partook of the family meal, which was\nrendered more cheerful by the presence of a man, past the meridian of\nlife, of polished manners, and dazzling wit. He endeavoured to draw Mary\nout, and succeeded; she entered into conversation, and some of her\nartless flights of genius struck him with surprise; he found she had a\ncapacious mind, and that her reason was as profound as her imagination\nwas lively. She glanced from earth to heaven, and caught the light of\ntruth. Her expressive countenance shewed what passed in her mind, and\nher tongue was ever the faithful interpreter of her heart; duplicity\nnever threw a shade over her words or actions. Mary found him a man of\nlearning; and the exercise of her understanding would frequently make\nher forget her griefs, when nothing else could, except benevolence.\n\nThis man had known the mistress of the house in her youth; good nature\ninduced him to visit her; but when he saw Mary he had another\ninducement. Her appearance, and above all, her genius, and cultivation\nof mind, roused his curiosity; but her dignified manners had such an\neffect on him, he was obliged to suppress it. He knew men, as well as\nbooks; his conversation was entertaining and improving. In Mary's\ncompany he doubted whether heaven was peopled with spirits masculine;\nand almost forgot that he had called the sex \"the pretty play things\nthat render life tolerable.\"\n\nHe had been the slave of beauty, the captive of sense; love he ne'er had\nfelt; the mind never rivetted the chain, nor had the purity of it made\nthe body appear lovely in his eyes. He was humane, despised meanness;\nbut was vain of his abilities, and by no means a useful member of\nsociety. He talked often of the beauty of virtue; but not having any\nsolid foundation to build the practice on, he was only a shining, or\nrather a sparkling character: and though his fortune enabled him to\nhunt down pleasure, he was discontented.\n\nMary observed his character, and wrote down a train of reflections,\nwhich these observations led her to make; these reflections received a\ntinge from her mind; the present state of it, was that kind of painful\nquietness which arises from reason clouded by disgust; she had not yet\nlearned to be resigned; vague hopes agitated her.\n\n\"There are some subjects that are so enveloped in clouds, as you\ndissipate one, another overspreads it. Of this kind are our reasonings\nconcerning happiness; till we are obliged to cry out with the Apostle,\n_That it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive in what it\ncould consist_, or how satiety could be prevented. Man seems formed for\naction, though the passions are seldom properly managed; they are\neither so languid as not to serve as a spur, or else so violent, as to\noverleap all bounds.\n\n\"Every individual has its own peculiar trials; and anguish, in one shape\nor other, visits every heart. Sensibility produces flights of virtue;\nand not curbed by reason, is on the brink of vice talking, and even\nthinking of virtue.\n\n\"Christianity can only afford just principles to govern the wayward\nfeelings and impulses of the heart: every good disposition runs wild, if\nnot transplanted into this soil; but how hard is it to keep the heart\ndiligently, though convinced that the issues of life depend on it.\n\n\"It is very difficult to discipline the mind of a thinker, or reconcile\nhim to the weakness, the inconsistency of his understanding; and a\nstill more laborious task for him to conquer his passions, and learn to\nseek content, instead of happiness. Good dispositions, and virtuous\npropensities, without the light of the Gospel, produce eccentric\ncharacters: comet-like, they are always in extremes; while revelation\nresembles the laws of attraction, and produces uniformity; but too often\nis the attraction feeble; and the light so obscured by passion, as to\nforce the bewildered soul to fly into void space, and wander in\nconfusion.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXV.\n\n\nA few mornings after, as Mary was sitting ruminating, harassed by\nperplexing thoughts, and fears, a letter was delivered to her: the\nservant waited for an answer. Her heart palpitated; it was from Henry;\nshe held it some time in her hand, then tore it open; it was not a long\none; and only contained an account of a relapse, which prevented his\nsailing in the first packet, as he had intended. Some tender enquiries\nwere added, concerning her health, and state of mind; but they were\nexpressed in rather a formal style: it vexed her, and the more so, as it\nstopped the current of affection, which the account of his arrival and\nillness had made flow to her heart--it ceased to beat for a moment--she\nread the passage over again; but could not tell what she was hurt\nby--only that it did not answer the expectations of her affection. She\nwrote a laconic, incoherent note in return, allowing him to call on her\nthe next day--he had requested permission at the conclusion of his\nletter.\n\nHer mind was then painfully active; she could not read or walk; she\ntried to fly from herself, to forget the long hours that were yet to run\nbefore to-morrow could arrive: she knew not what time he would come;\ncertainly in the morning, she concluded; the morning then was anxiously\nwished for; and every wish produced a sigh, that arose from expectation\non the stretch, damped by fear and vain regret.\n\nTo beguile the tedious time, Henry's favorite tunes were sung; the books\nthey read together turned over; and the short epistle read at least a\nhundred times.--Any one who had seen her, would have supposed that she\nwas trying to decypher Chinese characters.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, she hailed the tardy day, watched the rising\nsun, and then listened for every footstep, and started if she heard the\nstreet door opened. At last he came, and she who had been counting the\nhours, and doubting whether the earth moved, would gladly have escaped\nthe approaching interview.\n\nWith an unequal, irresolute pace, she went to meet him; but when she\nbeheld his emaciated countenance, all the tenderness, which the\nformality of his letter had damped, returned, and a mournful\npresentiment stilled the internal conflict. She caught his hand, and\nlooking wistfully at him, exclaimed, \"Indeed, you are not well!\"\n\n\"I am very far from well; but it matters not,\" added he with a smile of\nresignation; \"my native air may work wonders, and besides, my mother is\na tender nurse, and I shall sometimes see thee.\"\n\nMary felt for the first time in her life, envy; she wished\ninvoluntarily, that all the comfort he received should be from her. She\nenquired about the symptoms of his disorder; and heard that he had been\nvery ill; she hastily drove away the fears, that former dear bought\nexperience suggested: and again and again did she repeat, that she was\nsure he would soon recover. She would then look in his face, to see if\nhe assented, and ask more questions to the same purport. She tried to\navoid speaking of herself, and Henry left her, with, a promise of\nvisiting her the next day.\n\nHer mind was now engrossed by one fear--yet she would not allow herself\nto think that she feared an event she could not name. She still saw his\npale face; the sound of his voice still vibrated on her ears; she tried\nto retain it; she listened, looked round, wept, and prayed.\n\nHenry had enlightened the desolate scene: was this charm of life to fade\naway, and, like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wreck\nbehind? These thoughts disturbed her reason, she shook her head, as if\nto drive them out of it; a weight, a heavy one, was on her heart; all\nwas not well there.\n\nOut of this reverie she was soon woke to keener anguish, by the arrival\nof a letter from her husband; it came to Lisbon after her departure:\nHenry had forwarded it to her, but did not choose to deliver it\nhimself, for a very obvious reason; it might have produced a\nconversation he wished for some time to avoid; and his precaution took\nits rise almost equally from benevolence and love.\n\nShe could not muster up sufficient resolution to break the seal: her\nfears were not prophetic, for the contents gave her comfort. He informed\nher that he intended prolonging his tour, as he was now his own master,\nand wished to remain some time on the continent, and in particular to\nvisit Italy without any restraint: but his reasons for it appeared\nchildish; it was not to cultivate his taste, or tread on classic ground,\nwhere poets and philosophers caught their lore; but to join in the\nmasquerades, and such burlesque amusements.\n\nThese instances of folly relieved Mary, in some degree reconciled her\nto herself added fuel to the devouring flame--and silenced something\nlike a pang, which reason and conscience made her feel, when she\nreflected, that it is the office of Religion to reconcile us to the\nseemingly hard dispensations of providence; and that no inclination,\nhowever strong, should oblige us to desert the post assigned us, or\nforce us to forget that virtue should be an active principle; and that\nthe most desirable station, is the one that exercises our faculties,\nrefines our affections, and enables us to be useful.\n\nOne reflection continually wounded her repose; she feared not poverty;\nher wants were few; but in giving up a fortune, she gave up the power of\ncomforting the miserable, and making the sad heart sing for joy.\n\nHeaven had endowed her with uncommon humanity, to render her one of His\nbenevolent agents, a messenger of peace; and should she attend to her\nown inclinations?\n\nThese suggestions, though they could not subdue a violent passion,\nincreased her misery. One moment she was a heroine, half determined to\nbear whatever fate should inflict; the next, her mind would recoil--and\ntenderness possessed her whole soul. Some instances of Henry's\naffection, his worth and genius, were remembered: and the earth was only\na vale of tears, because he was not to sojourn with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVI.\n\n\nHenry came the next day, and once or twice in the course of the\nfollowing week; but still Mary kept up some little formality, a certain\nconsciousness restrained her; and Henry did not enter on the subject\nwhich he found she wished to avoid. In the course of conversation,\nhowever, she mentioned to him, that she earnestly desired to obtain a\nplace in one of the public offices for Ann's brother, as the family were\nagain in a declining way.\n\nHenry attended, made a few enquiries, and dropped the subject; but the\nfollowing week, she heard him enter with unusual haste; it was to inform\nher, that he had made interest with a person of some consequence, whom\nhe had once obliged in a very disagreeable exigency, in a foreign\ncountry; and that he had procured a place for her friend, which would\ninfallibly lead to something better, if he behaved with propriety. Mary\ncould not speak to thank him; emotions of gratitude and love suffused\nher face; her blood eloquently spoke. She delighted to receive benefits\nthrough the medium of her fellow creatures; but to receive them from\nHenry was exquisite pleasure.\n\nAs the summer advanced, Henry grew worse; the closeness of the air, in\nthe metropolis, affected his breath; and his mother insisted on his\nfixing on some place in the country, where she would accompany him. He\ncould not think of going far off, but chose a little village on the\nbanks of the Thames, near Mary's dwelling: he then introduced her to his\nmother.\n\nThey frequently went down the river in a boat; Henry would take his\nviolin, and Mary would sometimes sing, or read, to them. She pleased his\nmother; she inchanted him. It was an advantage to Mary that friendship\nfirst possessed her heart; it opened it to all the softer sentiments of\nhumanity:--and when this first affection was torn away, a similar one\nsprung up, with a still tenderer sentiment added to it.\n\nThe last evening they were on the water, the clouds grew suddenly black,\nand broke in violent showers, which interrupted the solemn stillness\nthat had prevailed previous to it. The thunder roared; and the oars\nplying quickly, in order to reach the shore, occasioned a not\nunpleasing sound. Mary drew still nearer Henry; she wished to have\nsought with him a watry grave; to have escaped the horror of surviving\nhim.--She spoke not, but Henry saw the workings of her mind--he felt\nthem; threw his arm round her waist--and they enjoyed the luxury of\nwretchedness.--As they touched the shore, Mary perceived that Henry was\nwet; with eager anxiety she cried, What shall I do!--this day will kill\nthee, and I shall not die with thee!\n\nThis accident put a stop to their pleasurable excursions; it had injured\nhim, and brought on the spitting of blood he was subject to--perhaps it\nwas not the cold that he caught, that occasioned it. In vain did Mary\ntry to shut her eyes; her fate pursued her! Henry every day grew worse\nand worse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVII.\n\n\nOppressed by her foreboding fears, her sore mind was hurt by new\ninstances of ingratitude: disgusted with the family, whose misfortunes\nhad often disturbed her repose, and lost in anticipated sorrow, she\nrambled she knew not where; when turning down a shady walk, she\ndiscovered her feet had taken the path they delighted to tread. She saw\nHenry sitting in his garden alone; he quickly opened the garden-gate,\nand she sat down by him.\n\n\"I did not,\" said he, \"expect to see thee this evening, my dearest Mary;\nbut I was thinking of thee. Heaven has endowed thee with an uncommon\nportion of fortitude, to support one of the most affectionate hearts in\nthe world. This is not a time for disguise; I know I am dear to\nthee--and my affection for thee is twisted with every fibre of my\nheart.--I loved thee ever since I have been acquainted with thine: thou\nart the being my fancy has delighted to form; but which I imagined\nexisted only there! In a little while the shades of death will encompass\nme--ill-fated love perhaps added strength to my disease, and smoothed\nthe rugged path. Try, my love, to fulfil thy destined course--try to add\nto thy other virtues patience. I could have wished, for thy sake, that\nwe could have died together--or that I could live to shield thee from\nthe assaults of an unfeeling world! Could I but offer thee an asylum in\nthese arms--a faithful bosom, in which thou couldst repose all thy\ngriefs--\" He pressed her to it, and she returned the pressure--he felt her\nthrobbing heart. A mournful silence ensued! when he resumed the\nconversation. \"I wished to prepare thee for the blow--too surely do I\nfeel that it will not be long delayed! The passion I have nursed is so\npure, that death cannot extinguish it--or tear away the impression thy\nvirtues have made on my soul. I would fain comfort thee--\"\n\n\"Talk not of comfort,\" interrupted Mary, \"it will be in heaven with thee\nand Ann--while I shall remain on earth the veriest wretch!\"--She grasped\nhis hand.\n\n\"There we shall meet, my love, my Mary, in our Father's--\" His voice\nfaultered; he could not finish the sentence; he was almost\nsuffocated--they both wept, their tears relieved them; they walked\nslowly to the garden-gate (Mary would not go into the house); they could\nnot say farewel when they reached it--and Mary hurried down the lane; to\nspare Henry the pain of witnessing her emotions.\n\nWhen she lost sight of the house she sat down on the ground, till it\ngrew late, thinking of all that had passed. Full of these thoughts, she\ncrept along, regardless of the descending rain; when lifting up her eyes\nto heaven, and then turning them wildly on the prospects around, without\nmarking them; she only felt that the scene accorded with her present\nstate of mind. It was the last glimmering of twilight, with a full moon,\nover which clouds continually flitted. Where am I wandering, God of\nMercy! she thought; she alluded to the wanderings of her mind. In what a\nlabyrinth am I lost! What miseries have I already encountered--and what\na number lie still before me.\n\nHer thoughts flew rapidly to something. I could be happy listening to\nhim, soothing his cares.--Would he not smile upon me--call me his own\nMary? I am not his--said she with fierceness--I am a wretch! and she\nheaved a sigh that almost broke her heart, while the big tears rolled\ndown her burning cheeks; but still her exercised mind, accustomed to\nthink, began to observe its operation, though the barrier of reason was\nalmost carried away, and all the faculties not restrained by her, were\nrunning into confusion. Wherefore am I made thus? Vain are my\nefforts--I cannot live without loving--and love leads to madness.--Yet\nI will not weep; and her eyes were now fixed by despair, dry and\nmotionless; and then quickly whirled about with a look of distraction.\n\nShe looked for hope; but found none--all was troubled waters.--No where\ncould she find rest. I have already paced to and fro in the earth; it is\nnot my abiding place--may I not too go home! Ah! no. Is this complying\nwith my Henry's request, could a spirit thus disengaged expect to\nassociate with his? Tears of tenderness strayed down her relaxed\ncountenance, and her softened heart heaved more regularly. She felt the\nrain, and turned to her solitary home.\n\nFatigued by the tumultuous emotions she had endured, when she entered\nthe house she ran to her own room, sunk on the bed; and exhausted\nnature soon closed her eyes; but active fancy was still awake, and a\nthousand fearful dreams interrupted her slumbers.\n\nFeverish and languid, she opened her eyes, and saw the unwelcome sun\ndart his rays through a window, the curtains of which she had forgotten\nto draw. The dew hung on the adjacent trees, and added to the lustre;\nthe little robin began his song, and distant birds joined. She looked;\nher countenance was still vacant--her sensibility was absorbed by one\nobject.\n\nDid I ever admire the rising sun, she slightly thought, turning from the\nWindow, and shutting her eyes: she recalled to view the last night's\nscene. His faltering voice, lingering step, and the look of tender woe,\nwere all graven on her heart; as were the words \"Could these arms\nshield thee from sorrow--afford thee an asylum from an unfeeling world.\"\nThe pressure to his bosom was not forgot. For a moment she was happy;\nbut in a long-drawn sigh every delightful sensation evaporated.\nSoon--yes, very soon, will the grave again receive all I love! and the\nremnant of my days--she could not proceed--Were there then days to come\nafter that?\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXVIII.\n\n\nJust as she was going to quit her room, to visit Henry, his mother\ncalled on her.\n\n\"My son is worse to-day,\" said she, \"I come to request you to spend not\nonly this day, but a week or two with me.--Why should I conceal any\nthing from you? Last night my child made his mother his confident, and,\nin the anguish of his heart, requested me to be thy friend--when I shall\nbe childless. I will not attempt to describe what I felt when he talked\nthus to me. If I am to lose the support of my age, and be again a\nwidow--may I call her Child whom my Henry wishes me to adopt?\"\n\nThis new instance of Henry's disinterested affection, Mary felt most\nforcibly; and striving to restrain the complicated emotions, and sooth\nthe wretched mother, she almost fainted: when the unhappy parent forced\ntears from her, by saying, \"I deserve this blow; my partial fondness\nmade me neglect him, when most he wanted a mother's care; this neglect,\nperhaps, first injured his constitution: righteous Heaven has made my\ncrime its own punishment; and now I am indeed a mother, I shall loss my\nchild--my only child!\"\n\nWhen they were a little more composed they hastened to the invalide; but\nduring the short ride, the mother related several instances of Henry's\ngoodness of heart. Mary's tears were not those of unmixed anguish; the\ndisplay of his virtues gave her extreme delight--yet human nature\nprevailed; she trembled to think they would soon unfold themselves in a\nmore genial clime.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXIX.\n\n\nShe found Henry very ill. The physician had some weeks before declared\nhe never knew a person with a similar pulse recover. Henry was certain\nhe could not live long; all the rest he could obtain, was procured by\nopiates. Mary now enjoyed the melancholy pleasure of nursing him, and\nsoftened by her tenderness the pains she could not remove. Every sigh\ndid she stifle, every tear restrain, when he could see or hear them. She\nwould boast of her resignation--yet catch eagerly at the least ray of\nhope. While he slept she would support his pillow, and rest her head\nwhere she could feel his breath. She loved him better than herself--she\ncould not pray for his recovery; she could only say, The will of Heaven\nbe done.\n\nWhile she was in this state, she labored to acquire fortitude; but one\ntender look destroyed it all--she rather labored, indeed, to make him\nbelieve he was resigned, than really to be so.\n\nShe wished to receive the sacrament with him, as a bond of union which\nwas to extend beyond the grave. She did so, and received comfort from\nit; she rose above her misery.\n\nHis end was now approaching. Mary sat on the side of the bed. His eyes\nappeared fixed--no longer agitated by passion, he only felt that it was\na fearful thing to die. The soul retired to the citadel; but it was not\nnow solely filled by the image of her who in silent despair watched for\nhis last breath. Collected, a frightful calmness stilled every turbulent\nemotion.\n\nThe mother's grief was more audible. Henry had for some time only\nattended to Mary--Mary pitied the parent, whose stings of conscience\nincreased her sorrow; she whispered him, \"Thy mother weeps, disregarded\nby thee; oh! comfort her!--My mother, thy son blesses thee.--\" The\noppressed parent left the room. And Mary _waited_ to see him die.\n\nShe pressed with trembling eagerness his parched lips--he opened his\neyes again; the spreading film retired, and love returned them--he gave\na look--it was never forgotten. My Mary, will you be comforted?\n\nYes, yes, she exclaimed in a firm voice; you go to be happy--I am not a\ncomplete wretch! The words almost choked her.\n\nHe was a long time silent; the opiate produced a kind of stupor. At\nlast, in an agony, he cried, It is dark; I cannot see thee; raise me up.\nWhere is Mary? did she not say she delighted to support me? let me die\nin her arms.\n\nHer arms were opened to receive him; they trembled not. Again he was\nobliged to lie down, resting on her: as the agonies increased he leaned\ntowards her: the soul seemed flying to her, as it escaped out of its\nprison. The breathing was interrupted; she heard distinctly the last\nsigh--and lifting up to Heaven her eyes, Father, receive his spirit, she\ncalmly cried.\n\nThe attendants gathered round; she moved not, nor heard the clamor; the\nhand seemed yet to press hers; it still was warm. A ray of light from\nan opened window discovered the pale face.\n\nShe left the room, and retired to one very near it; and sitting down on\nthe floor, fixed her eyes on the door of the apartment which contained\nthe body. Every event of her life rushed across her mind with wonderful\nrapidity--yet all was still--fate had given the finishing stroke. She\nsat till midnight.--Then rose in a phrensy, went into the apartment, and\ndesired those who watched the body to retire.\n\nShe knelt by the bed side;--an enthusiastic devotion overcame the\ndictates of despair.--She prayed most ardently to be supported, and\ndedicated herself to the service of that Being into whose hands, she had\ncommitted the spirit she almost adored--again--and again,--she prayed\nwildly--and fervently--but attempting to touch the lifeless hand--her\nhead swum--she sunk--\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXX.\n\n\nThree months after, her only friend, the mother of her lost Henry began\nto be alarmed, at observing her altered appearance; and made her own\nhealth a pretext for travelling. These complaints roused Mary out of her\ntorpid state; she imagined a new duty now forced her to exert herself--a\nduty love made sacred!--\n\nThey went to Bath, from that to Bristol; but the latter place they\nquickly left; the sight of the sick that resort there, they neither of\nthem could bear. From Bristol they flew to Southampton. The road was\npleasant--yet Mary shut her eyes;--or if they were open, green fields\nand commons, passed in quick succession, and left no more traces behind\nthan if they had been waves of the sea.\n\nSome time after they were settled at Southampton, they met the man who\ntook so much notice of Mary, soon after her return to England. He\nrenewed his acquaintance; he was really interested in her fate, as he\nhad heard her uncommon story; besides, he knew her husband; knew him to\nbe a good-natured, weak man. He saw him soon after his arrival in his\nnative country, and prevented his hastening to enquire into the reasons\nof Mary's strange conduct. He desired him not to be too precipitate, if\nhe ever wished to possess an invaluable treasure. He was guided by him,\nand allowed him to follow Mary to Southampton, and speak first to her\nfriend.\n\nThis friend determined to trust to her native strength of mind, and\ninformed her of the circumstance; but she overrated it: Mary was not\nable, for a few days after the intelligence, to fix on the mode of\nconduct she ought now to pursue. But at last she conquered her disgust,\nand wrote her _husband_ an account of what had passed since she had\ndropped his correspondence.\n\nHe came in person to answer the letter. Mary fainted when he approached\nher unexpectedly. Her disgust returned with additional force, in spite\nof previous reasonings, whenever he appeared; yet she was prevailed on\nto promise to live with him, if he would permit her to pass one year,\ntravelling from place to place; he was not to accompany her.\n\nThe time too quickly elapsed, and she gave him her hand--the struggle\nwas almost more than she could endure. She tried to appear calm; time\nmellowed her grief, and mitigated her torments; but when her husband\nwould take her hand, or mention any thing like love, she would instantly\nfeel a sickness, a faintness at her heart, and wish, involuntarily, that\nthe earth would open and swallow her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAP. XXXI.\n\n\nMary visited the continent, and sought health in different climates; but\nher nerves were not to be restored to their former state. She then\nretired to her house in the country, established manufactories, threw\nthe estate into small farms; and continually employed herself this way\nto dissipate care, and banish unavailing regret. She visited the sick,\nsupported the old, and educated the young.\n\nThese occupations engrossed her mind; but there were hours when all her\nformer woes would return and haunt her.--Whenever she did, or said, any\nthing she thought Henry would have approved of--she could not avoid\nthinking with anguish, of the rapture his approbation ever conveyed to\nher heart--a heart in which there was a void, that even benevolence and\nreligion could not fill. The latter taught her to struggle for\nresignation; and the former rendered life supportable.\n\nHer delicate state of health did not promise long life. In moments of\nsolitary sadness, a gleam of joy would dart across her mind--She thought\nshe was hastening to that world _where there is neither marrying_, nor\ngiving in marriage.", "answers": ["Because she is in unrequited love with someone else"], "length": 23316, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "26c6325283dece0b557e34cde9a5c57999ec5c68782e8194"}

                  _110\n Till in this cave they found the lady lone,\n Sitting upon a seat of emerald stone.\n\n 9.\n And universal Pan, 'tis said, was there,\n And though none saw him,--through the adamant\n Of the deep mountains, through the trackless air,             _115\n And through those living spirits, like a want,\n He passed out of his everlasting lair\n Where the quick heart of the great world doth pant,\n And felt that wondrous lady all alone,--\n And she felt him, upon her emerald throne.                    _120\n\n 10.\n And every nymph of stream and spreading tree,\n And every shepherdess of Ocean's flocks,\n Who drives her white waves over the green sea,\n And Ocean with the brine on his gray locks,\n And quaint Priapus with his company,                          _125\n All came, much wondering how the enwombed rocks\n Could have brought forth so beautiful a birth;--\n Her love subdued their wonder and their mirth.\n\n 11.\n The herdsmen and the mountain maidens came,\n And the rude kings of pastoral Garamant--                     _130\n Their spirits shook within them, as a flame\n Stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt:\n Pigmies, and Polyphemes, by many a name,\n Centaurs, and Satyrs, and such shapes as haunt\n Wet clefts,--and lumps neither alive nor dead,                _135\n Dog-headed, bosom-eyed, and bird-footed.\n\n 12.\n For she was beautiful--her beauty made\n The bright world dim, and everything beside\n Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:\n No thought of living spirit could abide,                      _140\n Which to her looks had ever been betrayed,\n On any object in the world so wide,\n On any hope within the circling skies,\n But on her form, and in her inmost eyes.\n\n 13.\n Which when the lady knew, she took her spindle                _145\n And twined three threads of fleecy mist, and three\n Long lines of light, such as the dawn may kindle\n The clouds and waves and mountains with; and she\n As many star-beams, ere their lamps could dwindle\n In the belated moon, wound skilfully;                         _150\n And with these threads a subtle veil she wove--\n A shadow for the splendour of her love.\n\n 14.\n The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling\n Were stored with magic treasures--sounds of air,\n Which had the power all spirits of compelling,                _155\n Folded in cells of crystal silence there;\n Such as we hear in youth, and think the feeling\n Will never die--yet ere we are aware,\n The feeling and the sound are fled and gone,\n And the regret they leave remains alone.                      _160\n\n 15.\n And there lay Visions swift, and sweet, and quaint,\n Each in its thin sheath, like a chrysalis,\n Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint\n With the soft burthen of intensest bliss.\n It was its work to bear to many a saint                       _165\n Whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is,\n Even Love's:--and others white, green, gray, and black,\n And of all shapes--and each was at her beck.\n\n 16.\n And odours in a kind of aviary\n Of ever-blooming Eden-trees she kept,                         _170\n Clipped in a floating net, a love-sick Fairy\n Had woven from dew-beams while the moon yet slept;\n As bats at the wired window of a dairy,\n They beat their vans; and each was an adept,\n When loosed and missioned, making wings of winds,             _175\n To stir sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds.\n\n 17.\n And liquors clear and sweet, whose healthful might\n Could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep,\n And change eternal death into a night\n Of glorious dreams--or if eyes needs must weep,               _180\n Could make their tears all wonder and delight,\n She in her crystal vials did closely keep:\n If men could drink of those clear vials, 'tis said\n The living were not envied of the dead.\n\n 18.\n Her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device,           _185\n The works of some Saturnian Archimage,\n Which taught the expiations at whose price\n Men from the Gods might win that happy age\n Too lightly lost, redeeming native vice;\n And which might quench the Earth-consuming rage               _190\n Of gold and blood--till men should live and move\n Harmonious as the sacred stars above;\n\n 19.\n And how all things that seem untameable,\n Not to be checked and not to be confined,\n Obey the spells of Wisdom's wizard skill;                     _195\n Time, earth, and fire--the ocean and the wind,\n And all their shapes--and man's imperial will;\n And other scrolls whose writings did unbind\n The inmost lore of Love--let the profane\n Tremble to ask what secrets they contain.                     _200\n\n 20.\n And wondrous works of substances unknown,\n To which the enchantment of her father's power\n Had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone,\n Were heaped in the recesses of her bower;\n Carved lamps and chalices, and vials which shone              _205\n In their own golden beams--each like a flower,\n Out of whose depth a fire-fly shakes his light\n Under a cypress in a starless night.\n\n 21.\n At first she lived alone in this wild home,\n And her own thoughts were each a minister,                    _210\n Clothing themselves, or with the ocean foam,\n Or with the wind, or with the speed of fire,\n To work whatever purposes might come\n Into her mind; such power her mighty Sire\n Had girt them with, whether to fly or run,                    _215\n Through all the regions which he shines upon.\n\n 22.\n The Ocean-nymphs and Hamadryades,\n Oreads and Naiads, with long weedy locks,\n Offered to do her bidding through the seas,\n Under the earth, and in the hollow rocks,                     _220\n And far beneath the matted roots of trees,\n And in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks,\n So they might live for ever in the light\n Of her sweet presence--each a satellite.\n\n 23.\n 'This may not be,' the wizard maid replied;                   _225\n 'The fountains where the Naiades bedew\n Their shining hair, at length are drained and dried;\n The solid oaks forget their strength, and strew\n Their latest leaf upon the mountains wide;\n The boundless ocean like a drop of dew                        _230\n Will be consumed--the stubborn centre must\n Be scattered, like a cloud of summer dust.\n\n 24.\n 'And ye with them will perish, one by one;--\n If I must sigh to think that this shall be,\n If I must weep when the surviving Sun                         _235\n Shall smile on your decay--oh, ask not me\n To love you till your little race is run;\n I cannot die as ye must--over me\n Your leaves shall glance--the streams in which ye dwell\n Shall be my paths henceforth, and so--farewell!'--            _240\n\n 25.\n She spoke and wept:--the dark and azure well\n Sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears,\n And every little circlet where they fell\n Flung to the cavern-roof inconstant spheres\n And intertangled lines of light:--a knell                     _245\n Of sobbing voices came upon her ears\n From those departing Forms, o'er the serene\n Of the white streams and of the forest green.\n\n 26.\n All day the wizard lady sate aloof,\n Spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity,                      _250\n Under the cavern's fountain-lighted roof;\n Or broidering the pictured poesy\n Of some high tale upon her growing woof,\n Which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye\n In hues outshining heaven--and ever she                       _255\n Added some grace to the wrought poesy.\n\n 27.\n While on her hearth lay blazing many a piece\n Of sandal wood, rare gums, and cinnamon;\n Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is--\n Each flame of it is as a precious stone                       _260\n Dissolved in ever-moving light, and this\n Belongs to each and all who gaze upon.\n The Witch beheld it not, for in her hand\n She held a woof that dimmed the burning brand.\n\n 28.\n This lady never slept, but lay in trance                      _265\n All night within the fountain--as in sleep.\n Its emerald crags glowed in her beauty's glance;\n Through the green splendour of the water deep\n She saw the constellations reel and dance\n Like fire-flies--and withal did ever keep                     _270\n The tenour of her contemplations calm,\n With open eyes, closed feet, and folded palm.\n\n 29.\n And when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended\n From the white pinnacles of that cold hill,\n She passed at dewfall to a space extended,                    _275\n Where in a lawn of flowering asphodel\n Amid a wood of pines and cedars blended,\n There yawned an inextinguishable well\n Of crimson fire--full even to the brim,\n And overflowing all the margin trim.                          _280\n\n 30.\n Within the which she lay when the fierce war\n Of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor\n In many a mimic moon and bearded star\n O'er woods and lawns;--the serpent heard it flicker\n In sleep, and dreaming still, he crept afar--                 _285\n And when the windless snow descended thicker\n Than autumn leaves, she watched it as it came\n Melt on the surface of the level flame.\n\n 31.\n She had a boat, which some say Vulcan wrought\n For Venus, as the chariot of her star;                        _290\n But it was found too feeble to be fraught\n With all the ardours in that sphere which are,\n And so she sold it, and Apollo bought\n And gave it to this daughter: from a car\n Changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                  _295\n Which ever upon mortal stream did float.\n\n 32.\n And others say, that, when but three hours old,\n The first-born Love out of his cradle lept,\n And clove dun Chaos with his wings of gold,\n And like a horticultural adept,                               _300\n Stole a strange seed, and wrapped it up in mould,\n And sowed it in his mother's star, and kept\n Watering it all the summer with sweet dew,\n And with his wings fanning it as it grew.\n\n 33.\n The plant grew strong and green, the snowy flower             _305\n Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began\n To turn the light and dew by inward power\n To its own substance; woven tracery ran\n Of light firm texture, ribbed and branching, o'er\n The solid rind, like a leaf's veined fan--                    _310\n Of which Love scooped this boat--and with soft motion\n Piloted it round the circumfluous ocean.\n\n 34.\n This boat she moored upon her fount, and lit\n A living spirit within all its frame,\n Breathing the soul of swiftness into it.                      _315\n Couched on the fountain like a panther tame,\n One of the twain at Evan's feet that sit--\n Or as on Vesta's sceptre a swift flame--\n Or on blind Homer's heart a winged thought,--\n In joyous expectation lay the boat.                           _320\n\n 35.\n Then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow\n Together, tempering the repugnant mass\n With liquid love--all things together grow\n Through which the harmony of love can pass;\n And a fair Shape out of her hands did flow--                  _325\n A living Image, which did far surpass\n In beauty that bright shape of vital stone\n Which drew the heart out of Pygmalion.\n\n 36.\n A sexless thing it was, and in its growth\n It seemed to have developed no defect                         _330\n Of either sex, yet all the grace of both,--\n In gentleness and strength its limbs were decked;\n The bosom swelled lightly with its full youth,\n The countenance was such as might select\n Some artist that his skill should never die,                  _335\n Imaging forth such perfect purity.\n\n 37.\n From its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings,\n Fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere,\n Tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings,\n Dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere:                        _340\n She led her creature to the boiling springs\n Where the light boat was moored, and said: 'Sit here!'\n And pointed to the prow, and took her seat\n Beside the rudder, with opposing feet.\n\n 38.\n And down the streams which clove those mountains vast,        _345\n Around their inland islets, and amid\n The panther-peopled forests whose shade cast\n Darkness and odours, and a pleasure hid\n In melancholy gloom, the pinnace passed;\n By many a star-surrounded pyramid                             _350\n Of icy crag cleaving the purple sky,\n And caverns yawning round unfathomably.\n\n 39.\n The silver noon into that winding dell,\n With slanted gleam athwart the forest tops,\n Tempered like golden evening, feebly fell;                    _355\n A green and glowing light, like that which drops\n From folded lilies in which glow-worms dwell,\n When Earth over her face Night's mantle wraps;\n Between the severed mountains lay on high,\n Over the stream, a narrow rift of sky.                        _360\n\n 40.\n And ever as she went, the Image lay\n With folded wings and unawakened eyes;\n And o'er its gentle countenance did play\n The busy dreams, as thick as summer flies,\n Chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay,                 _365\n And drinking the warm tears, and the sweet sighs\n Inhaling, which, with busy murmur vain,\n They had aroused from that full heart and brain.\n\n 41.\n And ever down the prone vale, like a cloud\n Upon a stream of wind, the pinnace went:                      _370\n Now lingering on the pools, in which abode\n The calm and darkness of the deep content\n In which they paused; now o'er the shallow road\n Of white and dancing waters, all besprent\n With sand and polished pebbles:--mortal boat                  _375\n In such a shallow rapid could not float.\n\n 42.\n And down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver\n Their snow-like waters into golden air,\n Or under chasms unfathomable ever\n Sepulchre them, till in their rage they tear                  _380\n A subterranean portal for the river,\n It fled--the circling sunbows did upbear\n Its fall down the hoar precipice of spray,\n Lighting it far upon its lampless way.\n\n 43.\n And when the wizard lady would ascend                         _385\n The labyrinths of some many-winding vale,\n Which to the inmost mountain upward tend--\n She called 'Hermaphroditus!'--and the pale\n And heavy hue which slumber could extend\n Over its lips and eyes, as on the gale                        _390\n A rapid shadow from a slope of grass,\n Into the darkness of the stream did pass.\n\n 44.\n And it unfurled its heaven-coloured pinions,\n With stars of fire spotting the stream below;\n And from above into the Sun's dominions                       _395\n Flinging a glory, like the golden glow\n In which Spring clothes her emerald-winged minions,\n All interwoven with fine feathery snow\n And moonlight splendour of intensest rime,\n With which frost paints the pines in winter time.             _400\n\n 45.\n And then it winnowed the Elysian air\n Which ever hung about that lady bright,\n With its aethereal vans--and speeding there,\n Like a star up the torrent of the night,\n Or a swift eagle in the morning glare                         _405\n Breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight,\n The pinnace, oared by those enchanted wings,\n Clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs.\n\n 46.\n The water flashed, like sunlight by the prow\n Of a noon-wandering meteor flung to Heaven;                   _410\n The still air seemed as if its waves did flow\n In tempest down the mountains; loosely driven\n The lady's radiant hair streamed to and fro:\n Beneath, the billows having vainly striven\n Indignant and impetuous, roared to feel                       _415\n The swift and steady motion of the keel.\n\n 47.\n Or, when the weary moon was in the wane,\n Or in the noon of interlunar night,\n The lady-witch in visions could not chain\n Her spirit; but sailed forth under the light                  _420\n Of shooting stars, and bade extend amain\n Its storm-outspeeding wings, the Hermaphrodite;\n She to the Austral waters took her way,\n Beyond the fabulous Thamondocana,--\n\n 48.\n Where, like a meadow which no scythe has shaven,              _425\n Which rain could never bend, or whirl-blast shake,\n With the Antarctic constellations paven,\n Canopus and his crew, lay the Austral lake--\n There she would build herself a windless haven\n Out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                   _430\n The bastions of the storm, when through the sky\n The spirits of the tempest thundered by:\n\n 49.\n A haven beneath whose translucent floor\n The tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably,\n And around which the solid vapours hoar,                      _435\n Based on the level waters, to the sky\n Lifted their dreadful crags, and like a shore\n Of wintry mountains, inaccessibly\n Hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray,\n And hanging crags, many a cove and bay.                       _440\n\n 50.\n And whilst the outer lake beneath the lash\n Of the wind's scourge, foamed like a wounded thing,\n And the incessant hail with stony clash\n Ploughed up the waters, and the flagging wing\n Of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                _445\n Looked like the wreck of some wind-wandering\n Fragment of inky thunder-smoke--this haven\n Was as a gem to copy Heaven engraven,--\n\n 51.\n On which that lady played her many pranks,\n Circling the image of a shooting star,                        _450\n Even as a tiger on Hydaspes' banks\n Outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are,\n In her light boat; and many quips and cranks\n She played upon the water, till the car\n Of the late moon, like a sick matron wan,                     _455\n To journey from the misty east began.\n\n 52.\n And then she called out of the hollow turrets\n Of those high clouds, white, golden and vermilion,\n The armies of her ministering spirits--\n In mighty legions, million after million,                     _460\n They came, each troop emblazoning its merits\n On meteor flags; and many a proud pavilion\n Of the intertexture of the atmosphere\n They pitched upon the plain of the calm mere.\n\n 53.\n They framed the imperial tent of their great Queen            _465\n Of woven exhalations, underlaid\n With lambent lightning-fire, as may be seen\n A dome of thin and open ivory inlaid\n With crimson silk--cressets from the serene\n Hung there, and on the water for her tread                    _470\n A tapestry of fleece-like mist was strewn,\n Dyed in the beams of the ascending moon.\n\n 54.\n And on a throne o'erlaid with starlight, caught\n Upon those wandering isles of aery dew,\n Which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not,               _475\n She sate, and heard all that had happened new\n Between the earth and moon, since they had brought\n The last intelligence--and now she grew\n Pale as that moon, lost in the watery night--\n And now she wept, and now she laughed outright.               _480\n\n 55.\n These were tame pleasures; she would often climb\n The steepest ladder of the crudded rack\n Up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime,\n And like Arion on the dolphin's back\n Ride singing through the shoreless air;--oft-time             _485\n Following the serpent lightning's winding track,\n She ran upon the platforms of the wind,\n And laughed to hear the fire-balls roar behind.\n\n 56.\n And sometimes to those streams of upper air\n Which whirl the earth in its diurnal round,                   _490\n She would ascend, and win the spirits there\n To let her join their chorus. Mortals found\n That on those days the sky was calm and fair,\n And mystic snatches of harmonious sound\n Wandered upon the earth where'er she passed,                  _495\n And happy thoughts of hope, too sweet to last.\n\n 57.\n But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,\n To glide adown old Nilus, where he threads\n Egypt and Aethiopia, from the steep\n Of utmost Axume, until he spreads,                            _500\n Like a calm flock of silver-fleeced sheep,\n His waters on the plain: and crested heads\n Of cities and proud temples gleam amid,\n And many a vapour-belted pyramid.\n\n 58.\n By Moeris and the Mareotid lakes,                             _505\n Strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors,\n Where naked boys bridling tame water-snakes,\n Or charioteering ghastly alligators,\n Had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes\n Of those huge forms--within the brazen doors                  _510\n Of the great Labyrinth slept both boy and beast,\n Tired with the pomp of their Osirian feast.\n\n 59.\n And where within the surface of the river\n The shadows of the massy temples lie,\n And never are erased--but tremble ever                        _515\n Like things which every cloud can doom to die,\n Through lotus-paven canals, and wheresoever\n The works of man pierced that serenest sky\n With tombs, and towers, and fanes, 'twas her delight\n To wander in the shadow of the night.                         _520\n\n 60.\n With motion like the spirit of that wind\n Whose soft step deepens slumber, her light feet\n Passed through the peopled haunts of humankind.\n Scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet,\n Through fane, and palace-court, and labyrinth mined           _525\n With many a dark and subterranean street\n Under the Nile, through chambers high and deep\n She passed, observing mortals in their sleep.\n\n 61.\n A pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see\n Mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep.                   _530\n Here lay two sister twins in infancy;\n There, a lone youth who in his dreams did weep;\n Within, two lovers linked innocently\n In their loose locks which over both did creep\n Like ivy from one stem;--and there lay calm                   _535\n Old age with snow-bright hair and folded palm.\n\n 62.\n But other troubled forms of sleep she saw,\n Not to be mirrored in a holy song--\n Distortions foul of supernatural awe,\n And pale imaginings of visioned wrong;                        _540\n And all the code of Custom's lawless law\n Written upon the brows of old and young:\n 'This,' said the wizard maiden, 'is the strife\n Which stirs the liquid surface of man's life.'\n\n 63.\n And little did the sight disturb her soul.--                  _545\n We, the weak mariners of that wide lake\n Where'er its shores extend or billows roll,\n Our course unpiloted and starless make\n O'er its wild surface to an unknown goal:--\n But she in the calm depths her way could take,                _550\n Where in bright bowers immortal forms abide\n Beneath the weltering of the restless tide.\n\n 64.\n And she saw princes couched under the glow\n Of sunlike gems; and round each temple-court\n In dormitories ranged, row after row,                         _555\n She saw the priests asleep--all of one sort--\n For all were educated to be so.--\n The peasants in their huts, and in the port\n The sailors she saw cradled on the waves,\n And the dead lulled within their dreamless graves.            _560\n\n 65.\n And all the forms in which those spirits lay\n Were to her sight like the diaphanous\n Veils, in which those sweet ladies oft array\n Their delicate limbs, who would conceal from us\n Only their scorn of all concealment: they                     _565\n Move in the light of their own beauty thus.\n But these and all now lay with sleep upon them,\n And little thought a Witch was looking on them.\n\n 66.\n She, all those human figures breathing there,\n Beheld as living spirits--to her eyes                         _570\n The naked beauty of the soul lay bare,\n And often through a rude and worn disguise\n She saw the inner form most bright and fair--\n And then she had a charm of strange device,\n Which, murmured on mute lips with tender tone,                _575\n Could make that spirit mingle with her own.\n\n 67.\n Alas! Aurora, what wouldst thou have given\n For such a charm when Tithon became gray?\n Or how much, Venus, of thy silver heaven\n Wouldst thou have yielded, ere Proserpina                     _580\n Had half (oh! why not all?) the debt forgiven\n Which dear Adonis had been doomed to pay,\n To any witch who would have taught you it?\n The Heliad doth not know its value yet.\n\n 68.\n 'Tis said in after times her spirit free                      _585\n Knew what love was, and felt itself alone--\n But holy Dian could not chaster be\n Before she stooped to kiss Endymion,\n Than now this lady--like a sexless bee\n Tasting all blossoms, and confined to none,                   _590\n Among those mortal forms, the wizard-maiden\n Passed with an eye serene and heart unladen.\n\n 69.\n To those she saw most beautiful, she gave\n Strange panacea in a crystal bowl:--\n They drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave,            _595\n And lived thenceforward as if some control,\n Mightier than life, were in them; and the grave\n Of such, when death oppressed the weary soul,\n Was as a green and overarching bower\n Lit by the gems of many a starry flower.                      _600\n\n 70.\n For on the night when they were buried, she\n Restored the embalmers' ruining, and shook\n The light out of the funeral lamps, to be\n A mimic day within that deathy nook;\n And she unwound the woven imagery                             _605\n Of second childhood's swaddling bands, and took\n The coffin, its last cradle, from its niche,\n And threw it with contempt into a ditch.\n\n 71.\n And there the body lay, age after age.\n Mute, breathing, beating, warm, and undecaying,               _610\n Like one asleep in a green hermitage,\n With gentle smiles about its eyelids playing,\n And living in its dreams beyond the rage\n Of death or life; while they were still arraying\n In liveries ever new, the rapid, blind                        _615\n And fleeting generations of mankind.\n\n 72.\n And she would write strange dreams upon the brain\n Of those who were less beautiful, and make\n All harsh and crooked purposes more vain\n Than in the desert is the serpent's wake                      _620\n Which the sand covers--all his evil gain\n The miser in such dreams would rise and shake\n Into a beggar's lap;--the lying scribe\n Would his own lies betray without a bribe.\n\n 73.\n The priests would write an explanation full,                  _625\n Translating hieroglyphics into Greek,\n How the God Apis really was a bull,\n And nothing more; and bid the herald stick\n The same against the temple doors, and pull\n The old cant down; they licensed all to speak                 _630\n Whate'er they thought of hawks, and cats, and geese,\n By pastoral letters to each diocese.\n\n 74.\n The king would dress an ape up in his crown\n And robes, and seat him on his glorious seat,\n And on the right hand of the sunlike throne                   _635\n Would place a gaudy mock-bird to repeat\n The chatterings of the monkey.--Every one\n Of the prone courtiers crawled to kiss the feet\n Of their great Emperor, when the morning came,\n And kissed--alas, how many kiss the same!

Time is precious, and Crito\nhas come early in order to gain his consent to a plan of escape.  This can\nbe easily accomplished by his friends, who will incur no danger in making\nthe attempt to save him, but will be disgraced for ever if they allow him\nto perish.  He should think of his duty to his children, and not play into\nthe hands of his enemies.  Money is already provided by Crito as well as by\nSimmias and others, and he will have no difficulty in finding friends in\nThessaly and other places.\n\nSocrates is afraid that Crito is but pressing upon him the opinions of the\nmany:  whereas, all his life long he has followed the dictates of reason\nonly and the opinion of the one wise or skilled man.  There was a time when\nCrito himself had allowed the propriety of this.  And although some one\nwill say 'the many can kill us,' that makes no difference; but a good life,\nin other words, a just and honourable life, is alone to be valued.  All\nconsiderations of loss of reputation or injury to his children should be\ndismissed:  the only question is whether he would be right in attempting to\nescape.  Crito, who is a disinterested person not having the fear of death\nbefore his eyes, shall answer this for him.  Before he was condemned they\nhad often held discussions, in which they agreed that no man should either\ndo evil, or return evil for evil, or betray the right.  Are these\nprinciples to be altered because the circumstances of Socrates are altered?\nCrito admits that they remain the same.  Then is his escape consistent with\nthe maintenance of them?  To this Crito is unable or unwilling to reply.\n\nSocrates proceeds:--Suppose the Laws of Athens to come and remonstrate with\nhim:  they will ask 'Why does he seek to overturn them?' and if he replies,\n'they have injured him,' will not the Laws answer, 'Yes, but was that the\nagreement?  Has he any objection to make to them which would justify him in\noverturning them?  Was he not brought into the world and educated by their\nhelp, and are they not his parents?  He might have left Athens and gone\nwhere he pleased, but he has lived there for seventy years more constantly\nthan any other citizen.'  Thus he has clearly shown that he acknowledged\nthe agreement, which he cannot now break without dishonour to himself and\ndanger to his friends.  Even in the course of the trial he might have\nproposed exile as the penalty, but then he declared that he preferred death\nto exile.  And whither will he direct his footsteps?  In any well-ordered\nstate the Laws will consider him as an enemy.  Possibly in a land of\nmisrule like Thessaly he may be welcomed at first, and the unseemly\nnarrative of his escape will be regarded by the inhabitants as an amusing\ntale.  But if he offends them he will have to learn another sort of lesson.\nWill he continue to give lectures in virtue?  That would hardly be decent.\nAnd how will his children be the gainers if he takes them into Thessaly,\nand deprives them of Athenian citizenship?  Or if he leaves them behind,\ndoes he expect that they will be better taken care of by his friends\nbecause he is in Thessaly?  Will not true friends care for them equally\nwhether he is alive or dead?\n\nFinally, they exhort him to think of justice first, and of life and\nchildren afterwards.  He may now depart in peace and innocence, a sufferer\nand not a doer of evil.  But if he breaks agreements, and returns evil for\nevil, they will be angry with him while he lives; and their brethren the\nLaws of the world below will receive him as an enemy.  Such is the mystic\nvoice which is always murmuring in his ears.\n\nThat Socrates was not a good citizen was a charge made against him during\nhis lifetime, which has been often repeated in later ages.  The crimes of\nAlcibiades, Critias, and Charmides, who had been his pupils, were still\nrecent in the memory of the now restored democracy.  The fact that he had\nbeen neutral in the death-struggle of Athens was not likely to conciliate\npopular good-will.  Plato, writing probably in the next generation,\nundertakes the defence of his friend and master in this particular, not to\nthe Athenians of his day, but to posterity and the world at large.\n\nWhether such an incident ever really occurred as the visit of Crito and the\nproposal of escape is uncertain:  Plato could easily have invented far more\nthan that (Phaedr.); and in the selection of Crito, the aged friend, as the\nfittest person to make the proposal to Socrates, we seem to recognize the\nhand of the artist.  Whether any one who has been subjected by the laws of\nhis country to an unjust judgment is right in attempting to escape, is a\nthesis about which casuists might disagree.  Shelley (Prose Works) is of\nopinion that Socrates 'did well to die,' but not for the 'sophistical'\nreasons which Plato has put into his mouth.  And there would be no\ndifficulty in arguing that Socrates should have lived and preferred to a\nglorious death the good which he might still be able to perform.  'A\nrhetorician would have had much to say upon that point.'  It may be\nobserved however that Plato never intended to answer the question of\ncasuistry, but only to exhibit the ideal of patient virtue which refuses to\ndo the least evil in order to avoid the greatest, and to show his master\nmaintaining in death the opinions which he had professed in his life.  Not\n'the world,' but the 'one wise man,' is still the paradox of Socrates in\nhis last hours.  He must be guided by reason, although her conclusions may\nbe fatal to him.  The remarkable sentiment that the wicked can do neither\ngood nor evil is true, if taken in the sense, which he means, of moral\nevil; in his own words, 'they cannot make a man wise or foolish.'\n\nThis little dialogue is a perfect piece of dialectic, in which granting the\n'common principle,' there is no escaping from the conclusion.  It is\nanticipated at the beginning by the dream of Socrates and the parody of\nHomer.  The personification of the Laws, and of their brethren the Laws in\nthe world below, is one of the noblest and boldest figures of speech which\noccur in Plato.\n\n\nCRITO\n\nby\n\nPlato\n\nTranslated by Benjamin Jowett\n\n\nPERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE:  Socrates, Crito.\n\nSCENE:  The Prison of Socrates.\n\n\nSOCRATES:  Why have you come at this hour, Crito? it must be quite early.\n\nCRITO:  Yes, certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  What is the exact time?\n\nCRITO:  The dawn is breaking.\n\nSOCRATES:  I wonder that the keeper of the prison would let you in.\n\nCRITO:  He knows me because I often come, Socrates; moreover.  I have done\nhim a kindness.\n\nSOCRATES:  And are you only just arrived?\n\nCRITO:  No, I came some time ago.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then why did you sit and say nothing, instead of at once\nawakening me?\n\nCRITO:  I should not have liked myself, Socrates, to be in such great\ntrouble and unrest as you are--indeed I should not:  I have been watching\nwith amazement your peaceful slumbers; and for that reason I did not awake\nyou, because I wished to minimize the pain.  I have always thought you to\nbe of a happy disposition; but never did I see anything like the easy,\ntranquil manner in which you bear this calamity.\n\nSOCRATES:  Why, Crito, when a man has reached my age he ought not to be\nrepining at the approach of death.\n\nCRITO:  And yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes, and\nage does not prevent them from repining.\n\nSOCRATES:  That is true.  But you have not told me why you come at this\nearly hour.\n\nCRITO:  I come to bring you a message which is sad and painful; not, as I\nbelieve, to yourself, but to all of us who are your friends, and saddest of\nall to me.\n\nSOCRATES:  What?  Has the ship come from Delos, on the arrival of which I\nam to die?\n\nCRITO:  No, the ship has not actually arrived, but she will probably be\nhere to-day, as persons who have come from Sunium tell me that they have\nleft her there; and therefore to-morrow, Socrates, will be the last day of\nyour life.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very well, Crito; if such is the will of God, I am willing; but\nmy belief is that there will be a delay of a day.\n\nCRITO:  Why do you think so?\n\nSOCRATES:  I will tell you.  I am to die on the day after the arrival of\nthe ship?\n\nCRITO:  Yes; that is what the authorities say.\n\nSOCRATES:  But I do not think that the ship will be here until to-morrow;\nthis I infer from a vision which I had last night, or rather only just now,\nwhen you fortunately allowed me to sleep.\n\nCRITO:  And what was the nature of the vision?\n\nSOCRATES:  There appeared to me the likeness of a woman, fair and comely,\nclothed in bright raiment, who called to me and said:  O Socrates,\n\n'The third day hence to fertile Phthia shalt thou go.'  (Homer, Il.)\n\nCRITO:  What a singular dream, Socrates!\n\nSOCRATES:  There can be no doubt about the meaning, Crito, I think.\n\nCRITO:  Yes; the meaning is only too clear.  But, oh! my beloved Socrates,\nlet me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape.  For if you die\nI shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced, but there is\nanother evil:  people who do not know you and me will believe that I might\nhave saved you if I had been willing to give money, but that I did not\ncare.  Now, can there be a worse disgrace than this--that I should be\nthought to value money more than the life of a friend?  For the many will\nnot be persuaded that I wanted you to escape, and that you refused.\n\nSOCRATES:  But why, my dear Crito, should we care about the opinion of the\nmany?  Good men, and they are the only persons who are worth considering,\nwill think of these things truly as they occurred.\n\nCRITO:  But you see, Socrates, that the opinion of the many must be\nregarded, for what is now happening shows that they can do the greatest\nevil to any one who has lost their good opinion.\n\nSOCRATES:  I only wish it were so, Crito; and that the many could do the\ngreatest evil; for then they would also be able to do the greatest good--\nand what a fine thing this would be!  But in reality they can do neither;\nfor they cannot make a man either wise or foolish; and whatever they do is\nthe result of chance.\n\nCRITO:  Well, I will not dispute with you; but please to tell me, Socrates,\nwhether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends:  are\nyou not afraid that if you escape from prison we may get into trouble with\nthe informers for having stolen you away, and lose either the whole or a\ngreat part of our property; or that even a worse evil may happen to us?\nNow, if you fear on our account, be at ease; for in order to save you, we\nought surely to run this, or even a greater risk; be persuaded, then, and\ndo as I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Yes, Crito, that is one fear which you mention, but by no means\nthe only one.\n\nCRITO:  Fear not--there are persons who are willing to get you out of\nprison at no great cost; and as for the informers they are far from being\nexorbitant in their demands--a little money will satisfy them.  My means,\nwhich are certainly ample, are at your service, and if you have a scruple\nabout spending all mine, here are strangers who will give you the use of\ntheirs; and one of them, Simmias the Theban, has brought a large sum of\nmoney for this very purpose; and Cebes and many others are prepared to\nspend their money in helping you to escape.  I say, therefore, do not\nhesitate on our account, and do not say, as you did in the court (compare\nApol.), that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself\nanywhere else.  For men will love you in other places to which you may go,\nand not in Athens only; there are friends of mine in Thessaly, if you like\nto go to them, who will value and protect you, and no Thessalian will give\nyou any trouble.  Nor can I think that you are at all justified, Socrates,\nin betraying your own life when you might be saved; in acting thus you are\nplaying into the hands of your enemies, who are hurrying on your\ndestruction.  And further I should say that you are deserting your own\nchildren; for you might bring them up and educate them; instead of which\nyou go away and leave them, and they will have to take their chance; and if\nthey do not meet with the usual fate of orphans, there will be small thanks\nto you.  No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to\npersevere to the end in their nurture and education.  But you appear to be\nchoosing the easier part, not the better and manlier, which would have been\nmore becoming in one who professes to care for virtue in all his actions,\nlike yourself.  And indeed, I am ashamed not only of you, but of us who are\nyour friends, when I reflect that the whole business will be attributed\nentirely to our want of courage.  The trial need never have come on, or\nmight have been managed differently; and this last act, or crowning folly,\nwill seem to have occurred through our negligence and cowardice, who might\nhave saved you, if we had been good for anything; and you might have saved\nyourself, for there was no difficulty at all.  See now, Socrates, how sad\nand discreditable are the consequences, both to us and you.  Make up your\nmind then, or rather have your mind already made up, for the time of\ndeliberation is over, and there is only one thing to be done, which must be\ndone this very night, and if we delay at all will be no longer practicable\nor possible; I beseech you therefore, Socrates, be persuaded by me, and do\nas I say.\n\nSOCRATES:  Dear Crito, your zeal is invaluable, if a right one; but if\nwrong, the greater the zeal the greater the danger; and therefore we ought\nto consider whether I shall or shall not do as you say.  For I am and\nalways have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason,\nwhatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the\nbest; and now that this chance has befallen me, I cannot repudiate my own\nwords:  the principles which I have hitherto honoured and revered I still\nhonour, and unless we can at once find other and better principles, I am\ncertain not to agree with you; no, not even if the power of the multitude\ncould inflict many more imprisonments, confiscations, deaths, frightening\nus like children with hobgoblin terrors (compare Apol.).  What will be the\nfairest way of considering the question?  Shall I return to your old\nargument about the opinions of men?--we were saying that some of them are\nto be regarded, and others not.  Now were we right in maintaining this\nbefore I was condemned?  And has the argument which was once good now\nproved to be talk for the sake of talking--mere childish nonsense?  That is\nwhat I want to consider with your help, Crito:--whether, under my present\ncircumstances, the argument appears to be in any way different or not; and\nis to be allowed by me or disallowed.  That argument, which, as I believe,\nis maintained by many persons of authority, was to the effect, as I was\nsaying, that the opinions of some men are to be regarded, and of other men\nnot to be regarded.  Now you, Crito, are not going to die to-morrow--at\nleast, there is no human probability of this, and therefore you are\ndisinterested and not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which\nyou are placed.  Tell me then, whether I am right in saying that some\nopinions, and the opinions of some men only, are to be valued, and that\nother opinions, and the opinions of other men, are not to be valued.  I ask\nyou whether I was right in maintaining this?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  The good are to be regarded, and not the bad?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  And the opinions of the wise are good, and the opinions of the\nunwise are evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what was said about another matter?  Is the pupil who\ndevotes himself to the practice of gymnastics supposed to attend to the\npraise and blame and opinion of every man, or of one man only--his\nphysician or trainer, whoever he may be?\n\nCRITO:  Of one man only.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that\none only, and not of the many?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly so.\n\nSOCRATES:  And he ought to act and train, and eat and drink in the way\nwhich seems good to his single master who has understanding, rather than\naccording to the opinion of all other men put together?\n\nCRITO:  True.\n\nSOCRATES:  And if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of\nthe one, and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding,\nwill he not suffer evil?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly he will.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what will the evil be, whither tending and what affecting,\nin the disobedient person?\n\nCRITO:  Clearly, affecting the body; that is what is destroyed by the evil.\n\nSOCRATES:  Very good; and is not this true, Crito, of other things which we\nneed not separately enumerate?  In questions of just and unjust, fair and\nfoul, good and evil, which are the subjects of our present consultation,\nought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them; or the opinion\nof the one man who has understanding? ought we not to fear and reverence\nhim more than all the rest of the world:  and if we desert him shall we not\ndestroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved\nby justice and deteriorated by injustice;--there is such a principle?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly there is, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Take a parallel instance:--if, acting under the advice of those\nwho have no understanding, we destroy that which is improved by health and\nis deteriorated by disease, would life be worth having?  And that which has\nbeen destroyed is--the body?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Could we live, having an evil and corrupted body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  And will life be worth having, if that higher part of man be\ndestroyed, which is improved by justice and depraved by injustice?  Do we\nsuppose that principle, whatever it may be in man, which has to do with\njustice and injustice, to be inferior to the body?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  More honourable than the body?\n\nCRITO:  Far more.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then, my friend, we must not regard what the many say of us:\nbut what he, the one man who has understanding of just and unjust, will\nsay, and what the truth will say.  And therefore you begin in error when\nyou advise that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and\nunjust, good and evil, honorable and dishonorable.--'Well,' some one will\nsay, 'but the many can kill us.'\n\nCRITO:  Yes, Socrates; that will clearly be the answer.\n\nSOCRATES:  And it is true; but still I find with surprise that the old\nargument is unshaken as ever.  And I should like to know whether I may say\nthe same of another proposition--that not life, but a good life, is to be\nchiefly valued?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, that also remains unshaken.\n\nSOCRATES:  And a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one--that\nholds also?\n\nCRITO:  Yes, it does.\n\nSOCRATES:  From these premisses I proceed to argue the question whether I\nought or ought not to try and escape without the consent of the Athenians:\nand if I am clearly right in escaping, then I will make the attempt; but if\nnot, I will abstain.  The other considerations which you mention, of money\nand loss of character and the duty of educating one's children, are, I\nfear, only the doctrines of the multitude, who would be as ready to restore\npeople to life, if they were able, as they are to put them to death--and\nwith as little reason.  But now, since the argument has thus far prevailed,\nthe only question which remains to be considered is, whether we shall do\nrightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and\npaying them in money and thanks, or whether in reality we shall not do\nrightly; and if the latter, then death or any other calamity which may\nensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the\ncalculation.\n\nCRITO:  I think that you are right, Socrates; how then shall we proceed?\n\nSOCRATES:  Let us consider the matter together, and do you either refute me\nif you can, and I will be convinced; or else cease, my dear friend, from\nrepeating to me that I ought to escape against the wishes of the Athenians:\nfor I highly value your attempts to persuade me to do so, but I may not be\npersuaded against my own better judgment.  And now please to consider my\nfirst position, and try how you can best answer me.\n\nCRITO:  I will.\n\nSOCRATES:  Are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong, or\nthat in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong, or is\ndoing wrong always evil and dishonorable, as I was just now saying, and as\nhas been already acknowledged by us?  Are all our former admissions which\nwere made within a few days to be thrown away?  And have we, at our age,\nbeen earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to\ndiscover that we are no better than children?  Or, in spite of the opinion\nof the many, and in spite of consequences whether better or worse, shall we\ninsist on the truth of what was then said, that injustice is always an evil\nand dishonour to him who acts unjustly?  Shall we say so or not?\n\nCRITO:  Yes.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we must do no wrong?\n\nCRITO:  Certainly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Nor when injured injure in return, as the many imagine; for we\nmust injure no one at all?  (E.g. compare Rep.)\n\nCRITO:  Clearly not.\n\nSOCRATES:  Again, Crito, may we do evil?\n\nCRITO:  Surely not, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  And what of doing evil in return for evil, which is the morality\nof the many--is that just or not?\n\nCRITO:  Not just.\n\nSOCRATES:  For doing evil to another is the same as injuring him?\n\nCRITO:  Very true.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to any\none, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.  But I would have you\nconsider, Crito, whether you really mean what you are saying.  For this\nopinion has never been held, and never will be held, by any considerable\nnumber of persons; and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed\nupon this point have no common ground, and can only despise one another\nwhen they see how widely they differ.  Tell me, then, whether you agree\nwith and assent to my first principle, that neither injury nor retaliation\nnor warding off evil by evil is ever right.  And shall that be the premiss\nof our argument?  Or do you decline and dissent from this?  For so I have\never thought, and continue to think; but, if you are of another opinion,\nlet me hear what you have to say.  If, however, you remain of the same mind\nas formerly, I will proceed to the next step.\n\nCRITO:  You may proceed, for I have not changed my mind.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then I will go on to the next point, which may be put in the\nform of a question:--Ought a man to do what he admits to be right, or ought\nhe to betray the right?\n\nCRITO:  He ought to do what he thinks right.\n\nSOCRATES:  But if this is true, what is the application?  In leaving the\nprison against the will of the Athenians, do I wrong any? or rather do I\nnot wrong those whom I ought least to wrong?  Do I not desert the\nprinciples which were acknowledged by us to be just--what do you say?\n\nCRITO:  I cannot tell, Socrates, for I do not know.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then consider the matter in this way:--Imagine that I am about\nto play truant (you may call the proceeding by any name which you like),\nand the laws and the government come and interrogate me:  'Tell us,\nSocrates,' they say; 'what are you about? are you not going by an act of\nyours to overturn us--the laws, and the whole state, as far as in you lies?\nDo you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown, in which the\ndecisions of law have no power, but are set aside and trampled upon by\nindividuals?'  What will be our answer, Crito, to these and the like words?\nAny one, and especially a rhetorician, will have a good deal to say on\nbehalf of the law which requires a sentence to be carried out.  He will\nargue that this law should not be set aside; and shall we reply, 'Yes; but\nthe state has injured us and given an unjust sentence.'  Suppose I say\nthat?\n\nCRITO:  Very good, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  'And was that our agreement with you?' the law would answer; 'or\nwere you to abide by the sentence of the state?'  And if I were to express\nmy astonishment at their words, the law would probably add:  'Answer,\nSocrates, instead of opening your eyes--you are in the habit of asking and\nanswering questions.  Tell us,--What complaint have you to make against us\nwhich justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state?  In the\nfirst place did we not bring you into existence?  Your father married your\nmother by our aid and begat you.  Say whether you have any objection to\nurge against those of us who regulate marriage?'  None, I should reply.\n'Or against those of us who after birth regulate the nurture and education\nof children, in which you also were trained?  Were not the laws, which have\nthe charge of education, right in commanding your father to train you in\nmusic and gymnastic?'  Right, I should reply.  'Well then, since you were\nbrought into the world and nurtured and educated by us, can you deny in the\nfirst place that you are our child and slave, as your fathers were before\nyou?  And if this is true you are not on equal terms with us; nor can you\nthink that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you.  Would\nyou have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to your father\nor your master, if you had one, because you have been struck or reviled by\nhim, or received some other evil at his hands?--you would not say this?\nAnd because we think right to destroy you, do you think that you have any\nright to destroy us in return, and your country as far as in you lies?\nWill you, O professor of true virtue, pretend that you are justified in\nthis?  Has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is\nmore to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any\nancestor, and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of\nunderstanding? also to be soothed, and gently and reverently entreated when\nangry, even more than a father, and either to be persuaded, or if not\npersuaded, to be obeyed?  And when we are punished by her, whether with\nimprisonment or stripes, the punishment is to be endured in silence; and if\nshe lead us to wounds or death in battle, thither we follow as is right;\nneither may any one yield or retreat or leave his rank, but whether in\nbattle or in a court of law, or in any other place, he must do what his\ncity and his country order him; or he must change their view of what is\njust:  and if he may do no violence to his father or mother, much less may\nhe do violence to his country.'  What answer shall we make to this, Crito?\nDo the laws speak truly, or do they not?\n\nCRITO:  I think that they do.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then the laws will say:  'Consider, Socrates, if we are speaking\ntruly that in your present attempt you are going to do us an injury.  For,\nhaving brought you into the world, and nurtured and educated you, and given\nyou and every other citizen a share in every good which we had to give, we\nfurther proclaim to any Athenian by the liberty which we allow him, that if\nhe does not like us when he has become of age and has seen the ways of the\ncity, and made our acquaintance, he may go where he pleases and take his\ngoods with him.  None of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him.\nAny one who does not like us and the city, and who wants to emigrate to a\ncolony or to any other city, may go where he likes, retaining his property.\nBut he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and\nadminister the state, and still remains, has entered into an implied\ncontract that he will do as we command him.  And he who disobeys us is, as\nwe maintain, thrice wrong:  first, because in disobeying us he is\ndisobeying his parents; secondly, because we are the authors of his\neducation; thirdly, because he has made an agreement with us that he will\nduly obey our commands; and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our\ncommands are unjust; and we do not rudely impose them, but give him the\nalternative of obeying or convincing us;--that is what we offer, and he\ndoes neither.\n\n'These are the sort of accusations to which, as we were saying, you,\nSocrates, will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions; you, above all\nother Athenians.'  Suppose now I ask, why I rather than anybody else? they\nwill justly retort upon me that I above all other men have acknowledged the\nagreement.  'There is clear proof,' they will say, 'Socrates, that we and\nthe city were not displeasing to you.  Of all Athenians you have been the\nmost constant resident in the city, which, as you never leave, you may be\nsupposed to love (compare Phaedr.).  For you never went out of the city\neither to see the games, except once when you went to the Isthmus, or to\nany other place unless when you were on military service; nor did you\ntravel as other men do.  Nor had you any curiosity to know other states or\ntheir laws:  your affections did not go beyond us and our state; we were\nyour especial favourites, and you acquiesced in our government of you; and\nhere in this city you begat your children, which is a proof of your\nsatisfaction.  Moreover, you might in the course of the trial, if you had\nliked, have fixed the penalty at banishment; the state which refuses to let\nyou go now would have let you go then.  But you pretended that you\npreferred death to exile (compare Apol.), and that you were not unwilling\nto die.  And now you have forgotten these fine sentiments, and pay no\nrespect to us the laws, of whom you are the destroyer; and are doing what\nonly a miserable slave would do, running away and turning your back upon\nthe compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen.  And first of all\nanswer this very question:  Are we right in saying that you agreed to be\ngoverned according to us in deed, and not in word only?  Is that true or\nnot?'  How shall we answer, Crito?  Must we not assent?\n\nCRITO:  We cannot help it, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Then will they not say:  'You, Socrates, are breaking the\ncovenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure, not in any\nhaste or under any compulsion or deception, but after you have had seventy\nyears to think of them, during which time you were at liberty to leave the\ncity, if we were not to your mind, or if our covenants appeared to you to\nbe unfair.  You had your choice, and might have gone either to Lacedaemon\nor Crete, both which states are often praised by you for their good\ngovernment, or to some other Hellenic or foreign state.  Whereas you, above\nall other Athenians, seemed to be so fond of the state, or, in other words,\nof us her laws (and who would care about a state which has no laws?), that\nyou never stirred out of her; the halt, the blind, the maimed, were not\nmore stationary in her than you were.  And now you run away and forsake\nyour agreements.  Not so, Socrates, if you will take our advice; do not\nmake yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city.\n\n'For just consider, if you transgress and err in this sort of way, what\ngood will you do either to yourself or to your friends?  That your friends\nwill be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship, or will lose their\nproperty, is tolerably certain; and you yourself, if you fly to one of the\nneighbouring cities, as, for example, Thebes or Megara, both of which are\nwell governed, will come to them as an enemy, Socrates, and their\ngovernment will be against you, and all patriotic citizens will cast an\nevil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws, and you will confirm in the\nminds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you.  For he\nwho is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be a corrupter of the\nyoung and foolish portion of mankind.  Will you then flee from well-ordered\ncities and virtuous men? and is existence worth having on these terms?  Or\nwill you go to them without shame, and talk to them, Socrates?  And what\nwill you say to them?  What you say here about virtue and justice and\ninstitutions and laws being the best things among men?  Would that be\ndecent of you?  Surely not.  But if you go away from well-governed states\nto Crito's friends in Thessaly, where there is great disorder and licence,\nthey will be charmed to hear the tale of your escape from prison, set off\nwith ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a\ngoatskin or some other disguise, and metamorphosed as the manner is of\nrunaways; but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you\nwere not ashamed to violate the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of\na little more life?  Perhaps not, if you keep them in a good temper; but if\nthey are out of temper you will hear many degrading things; you will live,\nbut how?--as the flatterer of all men, and the servant of all men; and\ndoing what?--eating and drinking in Thessaly, having gone abroad in order\nthat you may get a dinner.  And where will be your fine sentiments about\njustice and virtue?  Say that you wish to live for the sake of your\nchildren--you want to bring them up and educate them--will you take them\ninto Thessaly and deprive them of Athenian citizenship?  Is this the\nbenefit which you will confer upon them?  Or are you under the impression\nthat they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still\nalive, although absent from them; for your friends will take care of them?\nDo you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of Thessaly they will take care\nof them, and if you are an inhabitant of the other world that they will not\ntake care of them?  Nay; but if they who call themselves friends are good\nfor anything, they will--to be sure they will.\n\n'Listen, then, Socrates, to us who have brought you up.  Think not of life\nand children first, and of justice afterwards, but of justice first, that\nyou may be justified before the princes of the world below.  For neither\nwill you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this\nlife, or happier in another, if you do as Crito bids.  Now you depart in\ninnocence, a sufferer and not a doer of evil; a victim, not of the laws,\nbut of men.  But if you go forth, returning evil for evil, and injury for\ninjury, breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us,\nand wronging those whom you ought least of all to wrong, that is to say,\nyourself, your friends, your country, and us, we shall be angry with you\nwhile you live, and our brethren, the laws in the world below, will receive\nyou as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy\nus.  Listen, then, to us and not to Crito.'\n\nThis, dear Crito, is the voice which I seem to hear murmuring in my ears,\nlike the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic; that voice, I say,\nis humming in my ears, and prevents me from hearing any other.  And I know\nthat anything more which you may say will be vain.  Yet speak, if you have\nanything to say.\n\nCRITO:  I have nothing to say, Socrates.\n\nSOCRATES:  Leave me then, Crito, to fulfil the will of God, and to follow\nwhither he leads.", "answers": ["To smuggle Socrates out of prison and into a life of exile."], "length": 6592, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "68fc4dee839213b5259d41718909195c2f5274665bc18036"}

How Otto Saw the Great Emperor,\n\n\n\n\nFOREWORD.\n\nBetween the far away past history of the world, and that which lies near\nto us; in the time when the wisdom of the ancient times was dead and\nhad passed away, and our own days of light had not yet come, there lay a\ngreat black gulf in human history, a gulf of ignorance, of superstition,\nof cruelty, and of wickedness.\n\nThat time we call the dark or middle ages.\n\nFew records remain to us of that dreadful period in our world's history,\nand we only know of it through broken and disjointed fragments that have\nbeen handed down to us through the generations.\n\nYet, though the world's life then was so wicked and black, there yet\nremained a few good men and women here and there (mostly in peaceful\nand quiet monasteries, far from the thunder and the glare of the worlds\nbloody battle), who knew the right and the truth and lived according to\nwhat they knew; who preserved and tenderly cared for the truths that the\ndear Christ taught, and lived and died for in Palestine so long ago.\n\nThis tale that I am about to tell is of a little boy who lived and\nsuffered in those dark middle ages; of how he saw both the good and the\nbad of men, and of how, by gentleness and love and not by strife and\nhatred, he came at last to stand above other men and to be looked up to\nby all. And should you follow the story to the end, I hope you may find\nit a pleasure, as I have done, to ramble through those dark ancient\ncastles, to lie with little Otto and Brother John in the high\nbelfry-tower, or to sit with them in the peaceful quiet of the sunny\nold monastery garden, for, of all the story, I love best those early\npeaceful years that little Otto spent in the dear old White Cross on the\nHill.\n\nPoor little Otto's life was a stony and a thorny pathway, and it is well\nfor all of us nowadays that we walk it in fancy and not in truth.\n\n\n\n\nI. The Dragon's House.\n\nUp from the gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and bare, stood the walls\nand towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy\niron-pointed portcullis hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned\nblackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm\nbetween the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the\nsteep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There in the lap of\nthe hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants\nbelonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce,\ntilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely\nenough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played\nthe little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes\npeering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.\n\nBeyond these squalid huts lay the rushing, foaming river, spanned by a\nhigh, rude, stone bridge where the road from the castle crossed it, and\nbeyond the river stretched the great, black forest, within whose gloomy\ndepths the savage wild beasts made their lair, and where in winter time\nthe howling wolves coursed their flying prey across the moonlit snow and\nunder the net-work of the black shadows from the naked boughs above.\n\nThe watchman in the cold, windy bartizan or watch-tower that clung to\nthe gray walls above the castle gateway, looked from his narrow window,\nwhere the wind piped and hummed, across the tree-tops that rolled in\nendless billows of green, over hill and over valley to the blue and\ndistant slope of the Keiserberg, where, on the mountain side, glimmered\nfar away the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nWithin the massive stone walls through which the gaping gateway led,\nthree great cheerless brick buildings, so forbidding that even the\nyellow sunlight could not light them into brightness, looked down, with\nrow upon row of windows, upon three sides of the bleak, stone courtyard.\nBack of and above them clustered a jumble of other buildings, tower and\nturret, one high-peaked roof overtopping another.\n\nThe great house in the centre was the Baron's Hall, the part to the left\nwas called the Roderhausen; between the two stood a huge square pile,\nrising dizzily up into the clear air high above the rest--the great\nMelchior Tower.\n\nAt the top clustered a jumble of buildings hanging high aloft in the\nwindy space a crooked wooden belfry, a tall, narrow watch-tower, and a\nrude wooden house that clung partly to the roof of the great tower and\npartly to the walls.\n\nFrom the chimney of this crazy hut a thin thread of smoke would now and\nthen rise into the air, for there were folk living far up in that empty,\nairy desert, and oftentimes wild, uncouth little children were seen\nplaying on the edge of the dizzy height, or sitting with their bare\nlegs hanging down over the sheer depths, as they gazed below at what was\ngoing on in the court-yard. There they sat, just as little children in\nthe town might sit upon their father's door-step; and as the sparrows\nmight fly around the feet of the little town children, so the circling\nflocks of rooks and daws flew around the feet of these air-born\ncreatures.\n\nIt was Schwartz Carl and his wife and little ones who lived far up there\nin the Melchior Tower, for it overlooked the top of the hill behind the\ncastle and so down into the valley upon the further side. There, day\nafter day, Schwartz Carl kept watch upon the gray road that ran like a\nribbon through the valley, from the rich town of Gruenstaldt to the rich\ntown of Staffenburgen, where passed merchant caravans from the one to\nthe other--for the lord of Drachenhausen was a robber baron.\n\nDong! Dong! The great alarm bell would suddenly ring out from the belfry\nhigh up upon the Melchior Tower. Dong! Dong! Till the rooks and daws\nwhirled clamoring and screaming. Dong! Dong! Till the fierce wolf-hounds\nin the rocky kennels behind the castle stables howled dismally in\nanswer. Dong! Dong!--Dong! Dong!\n\nThen would follow a great noise and uproar and hurry in the castle\ncourt-yard below; men shouting and calling to one another, the ringing\nof armor, and the clatter of horses' hoofs upon the hard stone. With the\ncreaking and groaning of the windlass the iron-pointed portcullis would\nbe slowly raised, and with a clank and rattle and clash of iron chains\nthe drawbridge would fall crashing. Then over it would thunder horse and\nman, clattering away down the winding, stony pathway, until the great\nforest would swallow them, and they would be gone.\n\nThen for a while peace would fall upon the castle courtyard, the cock\nwould crow, the cook would scold a lazy maid, and Gretchen, leaning out\nof a window, would sing a snatch of a song, just as though it were a\npeaceful farm-house, instead of a den of robbers.\n\nMaybe it would be evening before the men would return once more. Perhaps\none would have a bloody cloth bound about his head, perhaps one would\ncarry his arm in a sling; perhaps one--maybe more than one--would be\nleft behind, never to return again, and soon forgotten by all excepting\nsome poor woman who would weep silently in the loneliness of her daily\nwork.\n\nNearly always the adventurers would bring back with them pack-horses\nladen with bales of goods. Sometimes, besides these, they would return\nwith a poor soul, his hands tied behind his back and his feet beneath\nthe horse's body, his fur cloak and his flat cap wofully awry. A while\nhe would disappear in some gloomy cell of the dungeon-keep, until an\nenvoy would come from the town with a fat purse, when his ransom would\nbe paid, the dungeon would disgorge him, and he would be allowed to go\nupon his way again.\n\nOne man always rode beside Baron Conrad in his expeditions and\nadventures a short, deep-chested, broad-shouldered man, with sinewy arms\nso long that when he stood his hands hung nearly to his knees.\n\nHis coarse, close-clipped hair came so low upon his brow that only a\nstrip of forehead showed between it and his bushy, black eyebrows. One\neye was blind; the other twinkled and gleamed like a spark under the\npenthouse of his brows. Many folk said that the one-eyed Hans had drunk\nbeer with the Hill-man, who had given him the strength of ten, for he\ncould bend an iron spit like a hazel twig, and could lift a barrel of\nwine from the floor to his head as easily as though it were a basket of\neggs.\n\nAs for the one-eyed Hans he never said that he had not drunk beer with\nthe Hill-man, for he liked the credit that such reports gave him with\nthe other folk. And so, like a half savage mastiff, faithful to death\nto his master, but to him alone, he went his sullen way and lived his\nsullen life within the castle walls, half respected, half feared by the\nother inmates, for it was dangerous trifling with the one-eyed Hans.\n\n\n\n\nII. How the Baron went Forth to Shear.\n\nBaron Conrad and Baroness Matilda sat together at their morning meal\nbelow their raised seats stretched the long, heavy wooden table, loaded\nwith coarse food--black bread, boiled cabbage, bacon, eggs, a great\nchine from a wild boar, sausages, such as we eat nowadays, and flagons\nand jars of beer and wine, Along the board sat ranged in the order of\nthe household the followers and retainers. Four or five slatternly women\nand girls served the others as they fed noisily at the table, moving\nhere and there behind the men with wooden or pewter dishes of food, now\nand then laughing at the jests that passed or joining in the talk. A\nhuge fire blazed and crackled and roared in the great open fireplace,\nbefore which were stretched two fierce, shaggy, wolfish-looking hounds.\nOutside, the rain beat upon the roof or ran trickling from the eaves,\nand every now and then a chill draught of wind would breathe through the\nopen windows of the great black dining-hall and set the fire roaring.\n\nAlong the dull-gray wall of stone hung pieces of armor, and swords and\nlances, and great branching antlers of the stag. Overhead arched the\nrude, heavy, oaken beams, blackened with age and smoke, and underfoot\nwas a chill pavement of stone.\n\nUpon Baron Conrad's shoulder leaned the pale, slender, yellow-haired\nBaroness, the only one in all the world with whom the fierce lord of\nDrachenhausen softened to gentleness, the only one upon whom his savage\nbrows looked kindly, and to whom his harsh voice softened with love.\n\nThe Baroness was talking to her husband in a low voice, as he looked\ndown into her pale face, with its gentle blue eyes.\n\n\"And wilt thou not, then,\" said she, \"do that one thing for me?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" he growled, in his deep voice, \"I cannot promise thee never more\nto attack the towns-people in the valley over yonder. How else could I\nlive an' I did not take from the fat town hogs to fill our own larder?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baroness, \"thou couldst live as some others do, for all\ndo not rob the burgher folk as thou dost. Alas! mishap will come upon\nthee some day, and if thou shouldst be slain, what then would come of\nme?\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"thy foolish fears\" But he laid his rough, hairy\nhand softly upon the Baroness' head and stroked her yellow hair.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness.\n\nA pause followed. The Baron sat looking thoughtfully down into the\nBaroness' face. A moment more, and he might have promised what she\nbesought; a moment more, and he might have been saved all the bitter\ntrouble that was to follow. But it was not to be.\n\nSuddenly a harsh sound broke the quietness of all into a confusion of\nnoises. Dong! Dong!--it was the great alarm-bell from Melchior's Tower.\n\nThe Baron started at the sound. He sat for a moment or two with his hand\nclinched upon the arm of his seat as though about to rise, then he sunk\nback into his chair again.\n\nAll the others had risen tumultuously from the table, and now stood\nlooking at him, awaiting his orders.\n\n\"For my sake, Conrad,\" said the Baroness again.\n\nDong! Dong! rang the alarm-bell. The Baron sat with his eyes bent upon\nthe floor, scowling blackly.\n\nThe Baroness took his hand in both of hers. \"For my sake,\" she pleaded,\nand the tears filled her blue eyes as she looked up at him, \"do not go\nthis time.\"\n\nFrom the courtyard without came the sound of horses' hoofs clashing\nagainst the stone pavement, and those in the hall stood watching and\nwondering at this strange delay of the Lord Baron. Just then the door\nopened and one came pushing past the rest; it was the one-eyed Hans.\nHe came straight to where the Baron sat, and, leaning over, whispered\nsomething into his master's ear.\n\n\"For my sake,\" implored the Baroness again; but the scale was turned.\nThe Baron pushed back his chair heavily and rose to his feet. \"Forward!\"\nhe roared, in a voice of thunder, and a great shout went up in answer as\nhe strode clanking down the hall and out of the open door.\n\nThe Baroness covered her face with her hands and wept.\n\n\"Never mind, little bird,\" said old Ursela, the nurse, soothingly; \"he\nwill come back to thee again as he has come back to thee before.\"\n\nBut the poor young Baroness continued weeping with her face buried in\nher hands, because he had not done that thing she had asked.\n\nA white young face framed in yellow hair looked out into the courtyard\nfrom a window above; but if Baron Conrad of Drachenhausen saw it from\nbeneath the bars of his shining helmet, he made no sign.\n\n\"Forward,\" he cried again.\n\nDown thundered the drawbridge, and away they rode with clashing hoofs\nand ringing armor through the gray shroud of drilling rain.\n\nThe day had passed and the evening had come, and the Baroness and her\nwomen sat beside a roaring fire. All were chattering and talking and\nlaughing but two--the fair young Baroness and old Ursela; the one sat\nlistening, listening, listening, the other sat with her chin resting in\nthe palm of her hand, silently watching her young mistress. The night\nwas falling gray and chill, when suddenly the clear notes of a bugle\nrang from without the castle walls. The young Baroness started, and the\nrosy light flashed up into her pale cheeks.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said old Ursela; \"the red fox has come back to his den\nagain, and I warrant he brings a fat town goose in his mouth; now we'll\nhave fine clothes to wear, and thou another gold chain to hang about thy\npretty neck.\"\n\nThe young Baroness laughed merrily at the old woman's speech. \"This\ntime,\" said she, \"I will choose a string of pearls like that one my aunt\nused to wear, and which I had about my neck when Conrad first saw me.\"\n\nMinute after minute passed; the Baroness sat nervously playing with a\nbracelet of golden beads about her wrist. \"How long he stays,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ursela; \"but it is not cousin wish that holds him by the\ncoat.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a door banged in the passageway without, and the ring of\niron footsteps sounded upon the stone floor. Clank! Clank! Clank!\n\nThe Baroness rose to her feet, her face all alight. The door opened;\nthen the flush of joy faded away and the face grew white, white, white.\nOne hand clutched the back of the bench whereon she had been sitting,\nthe other hand pressed tightly against her side.\n\nIt was Hans the one-eyed who stood in the doorway, and black trouble sat\non his brow; all were looking at him waiting.\n\n\"Conrad,\" whispered the Baroness, at last. \"Where is Conrad? Where is\nyour master?\" and even her lips were white as she spoke.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans said nothing.\n\nJust then came the noise of men s voices in the corridor and the shuffle\nand scuffle of feet carrying a heavy load. Nearer and nearer they came,\nand one-eyed Hans stood aside. Six men came struggling through the\ndoorway, carrying a litter, and on the litter lay the great Baron\nConrad. The flaming torch thrust into the iron bracket against the wall\nflashed up with the draught of air from the open door, and the light\nfell upon the white face and the closed eyes, and showed upon his body\narmor a great red stain that was not the stain of rust.\n\nSuddenly Ursela cried out in a sharp, shrill voice, \"Catch her, she\nfalls!\"\n\nIt was the Baroness.\n\nThen the old crone turned fiercely upon the one-eyed Hans. \"Thou fool!\"\nshe cried, \"why didst thou bring him here? Thou hast killed thy lady!\"\n\n\"I did not know,\" said the one-eyed Hans, stupidly.\n\n\n\n\nIII. How the Baron came Home Shorn.\n\nBut Baron Conrad was not dead. For days he lay upon his hard bed, now\nmuttering incoherent words beneath his red beard, now raving fiercely\nwith the fever of his wound. But one day he woke again to the things\nabout him.\n\nHe turned his head first to the one side and then to the other; there\nsat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans. Two or three other retainers\nstood by a great window that looked out into the courtyard beneath,\njesting and laughing together in low tones, and one lay upon the heavy\noaken bench that stood along by the wall snoring in his sleep.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron, presently; \"and why is she not\nwith me at this time?\"\n\nThe man that lay upon the bench started up at the sound of his voice,\nand those at the window came hurrying to his bedside. But Schwartz Carl\nand the one-eyed Hans looked at one another, and neither of them spoke.\nThe Baron saw the look and in it read a certain meaning that brought\nhim to his elbow, though only to sink back upon his pillow again with a\ngroan.\n\n\"Why do you not answer me?\" said he at last, in a hollow voice; then\nto the one-eyed Hans, \"Hast no tongue, fool, that thou standest gaping\nthere like a fish? Answer me, where is thy mistress?\"\n\n\"I--I do not know,\" stammered poor Hans.\n\nFor a while the Baron lay silently looking from one face to the other,\nthen he spoke again. \"How long have I been lying here?\" said he.\n\n\"A sennight, my lord,\" said Master Rudolph, the steward, who had come\ninto the room and who now stood among the others at the bedside.\n\n\"A sennight,\" repeated the Baron, in a low voice, and then to Master\nRudolph, \"And has the Baroness been often beside me in that time?\"\nMaster Rudolph hesitated. \"Answer me,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\n\"Not--not often,\" said Master Rudolph, hesitatingly.\n\nThe Baron lay silent for a long time. At last he passed his hands over\nhis face and held them there for a minute, then of a sudden, before\nanyone knew what he was about to do, he rose upon his elbow and then sat\nupright upon the bed. The green wound broke out afresh and a dark red\nspot grew and spread upon the linen wrappings; his face was drawn and\nhaggard with the pain of his moving, and his eyes wild and bloodshot.\nGreat drops of sweat gathered and stood upon his forehead as he sat\nthere swaying slightly from side to side.\n\n\"My shoes,\" said he, hoarsely.\n\nMaster Rudolph stepped forward. \"But, my Lord Baron,\" he began and then\nstopped short, for the Baron shot him such a look that his tongue stood\nstill in his head.\n\nHans saw that look out of his one eye. Down he dropped upon his knees\nand, fumbling under the bed, brought forth a pair of soft leathern\nshoes, which he slipped upon the Baron's feet and then laced the thongs\nabove the instep.\n\n\"Your shoulder,\" said the Baron. He rose slowly to his feet, gripping\nHans in the stress of his agony until the fellow winced again. For a\nmoment he stood as though gathering strength, then doggedly started\nforth upon that quest which he had set upon himself.\n\nAt the door he stopped for a moment as though overcome by his weakness,\nand there Master Nicholas, his cousin, met him; for the steward had sent\none of the retainers to tell the old man what the Baron was about to do.\n\n\"Thou must go back again, Conrad,\" said Master Nicholas; \"thou art not\nfit to be abroad.\"\n\nThe Baron answered him never a word, but he glared at him from out of\nhis bloodshot eyes and ground his teeth together. Then he started forth\nagain upon his way.\n\nDown the long hall he went, slowly and laboriously, the others following\nsilently behind him, then up the steep winding stairs, step by step,\nnow and then stopping to lean against the wall. So he reached a long\nand gloomy passageway lit only by the light of a little window at the\nfurther end.\n\nHe stopped at the door of one of the rooms that opened into this\npassage-way, stood for a moment, then he pushed it open.\n\nNo one was within but old Ursela, who sat crooning over a fire with a\nbundle upon her knees. She did not see the Baron or know that he was\nthere.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said he, in a hollow voice.\n\nThen the old nurse looked up with a start. \"Jesu bless us,\" cried she,\nand crossed herself.\n\n\"Where is your lady?\" said the Baron again, in the same hoarse voice;\nand then, not waiting for an answer, \"Is she dead?\"\n\nThe old woman looked at him for a minute blinking her watery eyes, and\nthen suddenly broke into a shrill, long-drawn wail. The Baron needed to\nhear no more.\n\nAs though in answer to the old woman's cry, a thin piping complaint came\nfrom the bundle in her lap.\n\nAt the sound the red blood flashed up into the Baron's face. \"What\nis that you have there?\" said he, pointing to the bundle upon the old\nwoman's knees.\n\nShe drew back the coverings and there lay a poor, weak, little baby,\nthat once again raised its faint reedy pipe.\n\n\"It is your son,\" said Ursela, \"that the dear Baroness left behind her\nwhen the holy angels took her to Paradise. She blessed him and called\nhim Otto before she left us.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV. The White Cross on the Hill.\n\nHere the glassy waters of the River Rhine, holding upon its bosom a\nmimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds floating above, runs\nsmoothly around a jutting point of land, St. Michaelsburg, rising from\nthe reedy banks of the stream, sweeps up with a smooth swell until\nit cuts sharp and clear against the sky. Stubby vineyards covered its\nearthy breast, and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow, where\nlay the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg--\"The White Cross on the Hill.\"\nThere within the white walls, where the warm yellow sunlight slept, all\nwas peaceful quietness, broken only now and then by the crowing of\nthe cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen, the lowing of kine or the\nbleating of goats, a solitary voice in prayer, the faint accord of\ndistant singing, or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the\nhigh-peaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth,\nfar-winding stream. No other sounds broke the stillness, for in this\npeaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor, the ring of iron-shod\nhoofs, or the hoarse call to arms.\n\nAll men were not wicked and cruel and fierce in that dark, far-away age;\nall were not robbers and terror-spreading tyrants, even in that time\nwhen men's hands were against their neighbors, and war and rapine dwelt\nin place of peace and justice.\n\nAbbot Otto, of St. Michaelsburg, was a gentle, patient, pale-faced old\nman; his white hands were soft and smooth, and no one would have thought\nthat they could have known the harsh touch of sword-hilt and lance. And\nyet, in the days of the Emperor Frederick--the grandson of the great\nRed-beard--no one stood higher in the prowess of arms than he. But all\nat once--for why, no man could tell--a change came over him, and in the\nflower of his youth and fame and growing power he gave up everything\nin life and entered the quiet sanctuary of that white monastery on the\nhill-side, so far away from the tumult and the conflict of the world in\nwhich he had lived.\n\nSome said that it was because the lady he had loved had loved his\nbrother, and that when they were married Otto of Wolbergen had left the\nchurch with a broken heart.\n\nBut such stories are old songs that have been sung before.\n\nClatter! clatter! Jingle! jingle! It was a full-armed knight that came\nriding up the steep hill road that wound from left to right and right to\nleft amid the vineyards on the slopes of St. Michaelsburg. Polished helm\nand corselet blazed in the noon sunlight, for no knight in those days\ndared to ride the roads except in full armor. In front of him the\nsolitary knight carried a bundle wrapped in the folds of his coarse gray\ncloak.\n\nIt was a sorely sick man that rode up the heights of St. Michaelsburg.\nHis head hung upon his breast through the faintness of weariness and\npain; for it was the Baron Conrad.\n\nHe had left his bed of sickness that morning, had saddled his horse in\nthe gray dawn with his own hands, and had ridden away into the misty\ntwilight of the forest without the knowledge of anyone excepting the\nporter, who, winking and blinking in the bewilderment of his broken\nslumber, had opened the gates to the sick man, hardly knowing what he\nwas doing, until he beheld his master far away, clattering down the\nsteep bridle-path.\n\nEight leagues had he ridden that day with neither a stop nor a stay; but\nnow at last the end of his journey had come, and he drew rein under the\nshade of the great wooden gateway of St. Michaelsburg.\n\nHe reached up to the knotted rope and gave it a pull, and from within\nsounded the answering ring of the porter's bell. By and by a little\nwicket opened in the great wooden portals, and the gentle, wrinkled face\nof old Brother Benedict, the porter, peeped out at the strange iron-clad\nvisitor and the great black war-horse, streaked and wet with the sweat\nof the journey, flecked and dappled with flakes of foam. A few words\npassed between them, and then the little window was closed again; and\nwithin, the shuffling pat of the sandalled feet sounded fainter and\nfainter, as Brother Benedict bore the message from Baron Conrad to Abbot\nOtto, and the mail-clad figure was left alone, sitting there as silent\nas a statue.\n\nBy and by the footsteps sounded again; there came a noise of clattering\nchains and the rattle of the key in the lock, and the rasping of the\nbolts dragged back. Then the gate swung slowly open, and Baron Conrad\nrode into the shelter of the White Cross, and as the hoofs of his\nwar-horse clashed upon the stones of the courtyard within, the wooden\ngate swung slowly to behind him.\n\nAbbot Otto stood by the table when Baron Conrad entered the high-vaulted\nroom from the farther end. The light from the oriel window behind the\nold man shed broken rays of light upon him, and seemed to frame his thin\ngray hairs with a golden glory. His white, delicate hand rested upon the\ntable beside him, and upon some sheets of parchment covered with rows of\nancient Greek writing which he had been engaged in deciphering.\n\nClank! clank! clank! Baron Conrad strode across the stone floor, and\nthen stopped short in front of the good old man.\n\n\"What dost thou seek here, my son?\" said the Abbot.\n\n\"I seek sanctuary for my son and thy brother's grandson,\" said the Baron\nConrad, and he flung back the folds of his cloak and showed the face of\nthe sleeping babe.\n\nFor a while the Abbot said nothing, but stood gazing dreamily at\nthe baby. After a while he looked up. \"And the child's mother,\" said\nhe--\"what hath she to say at this?\"\n\n\"She hath naught to say,\" said Baron Conrad, hoarsely, and then stopped\nshort in his speech. \"She is dead,\" said he, at last, in a husky voice,\n\"and is with God's angels in paradise.\"\n\nThe Abbot looked intently in the Baron's face. \"So!\" said he, under his\nbreath, and then for the first time noticed how white and drawn was the\nBaron's face. \"Art sick thyself?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ay,\" said the Baron, \"I have come from death's door. But that is no\nmatter. Wilt thou take this little babe into sanctuary? My house is a\nvile, rough place, and not fit for such as he, and his mother with the\nblessed saints in heaven.\" And once more Conrad of Drachenhausen's face\nbegan twitching with the pain of his thoughts.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, gently, \"he shall live here,\" and he stretched\nout his hands and took the babe. \"Would,\" said he, \"that all the little\nchildren in these dark times might be thus brought to the house of God,\nand there learn mercy and peace, instead of rapine and war.\"\n\nFor a while he stood looking down in silence at the baby in his arms,\nbut with his mind far away upon other things. At last he roused himself\nwith a start. \"And thou,\" said he to the Baron Conrad--\"hath not thy\nheart been chastened and softened by this? Surely thou wilt not go back\nto thy old life of rapine and extortion?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Baron Conrad, gruffly, \"I will rob the city swine no longer,\nfor that was the last thing that my dear one asked of me.\"\n\nThe old Abbot's face lit up with a smile. \"I am right glad that thy\nheart was softened, and that thou art willing at last to cease from war\nand violence.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" cried the Baron, roughly, \"I said nothing of ceasing from war. By\nheaven, no! I will have revenge!\" And he clashed his iron foot upon the\nfloor and clinched his fists and ground his teeth together. \"Listen,\"\nsaid he, \"and I will tell thee how my troubles happened. A fortnight ago\nI rode out upon an expedition against a caravan of fat burghers in the\nvalley of Gruenhoffen. They outnumbered us many to one, but city swine\nsuch as they are not of the stuff to stand against our kind for a long\ntime. Nevertheless, while the men-at-arms who guarded the caravan were\nstaying us with pike and cross-bow from behind a tree which they had\nfelled in front of a high bridge the others had driven the pack-horses\noff, so that by the time we had forced the bridge they were a league\nor more away. We pushed after them as hard as we were able, but when we\ncame up with them we found that they had been joined by Baron Frederick\nof Trutz-Drachen, to whom for three years and more the burghers of\nGruenstadt have been paying a tribute for his protection against others.\nThen again they made a stand, and this time the Baron Frederick himself\nwas with them. But though the dogs fought well, we were forcing them\nback, and might have got the better of them, had not my horse stumbled\nupon a sloping stone, and so fell and rolled over upon me. While I lay\nthere with my horse upon me, Baron Frederick ran me down with his lance,\nand gave me that foul wound that came so near to slaying me--and did\nslay my dear wife. Nevertheless, my men were able to bring me out from\nthat press and away, and we had bitten the Trutz-Drachen dogs so deep\nthat they were too sore to follow us, and so let us go our way in peace.\nBut when those fools of mine brought me to my castle they bore me lying\nupon a litter to my wife's chamber. There she beheld me, and, thinking\nme dead, swooned a death-swoon, so that she only lived long enough to\nbless her new-born babe and name it Otto, for you, her father's brother.\nBut, by heavens! I will have revenge, root and branch, upon that vile\ntribe, the Roderburgs of Trutz-Drachen. Their great-grandsire built that\ncastle in scorn of Baron Casper in the old days; their grandsire slew my\nfather's grandsire; Baron Nicholas slew two of our kindred; and now this\nBaron Frederick gives me that foul wound and kills my dear wife through\nmy body.\" Here the Baron stopped short; then of a sudden, shaking his\nfist above his head, he cried out in his hoarse voice: \"I swear by all\nthe saints in heaven, either the red cock shall crow over the roof of\nTrutz-Drachen or else it shall crow over my house! The black dog shall\nsit on Baron Frederick's shoulders or else he shall sit on mine!\" Again\nhe stopped, and fixing his blazing eyes upon the old man, \"Hearest thou\nthat, priest?\" said he, and broke into a great boisterous laugh.\n\nAbbot Otto sighed heavily, but he tried no further to persuade the other\ninto different thoughts.\n\n\"Thou art wounded,\" said he, at last, in a gentle voice; \"at least stay\nhere with us until thou art healed.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, roughly, \"I will tarry no longer than to hear\nthee promise to care for my child.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said the Abbot; \"but lay aside thy armor, and rest.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Baron, \"I go back again to-day.\"\n\nAt this the Abbot cried out in amazement: \"Sure thou, wounded man, would\nnot take that long journey without a due stay for resting! Think! Night\nwill be upon thee before thou canst reach home again, and the forests\nare beset with wolves.\"\n\nThe Baron laughed. \"Those are not the wolves I fear,\" said he. \"Urge me\nno further, I must return to-night; yet if thou hast a mind to do me a\nkindness thou canst give me some food to eat and a flask of your golden\nMichaelsburg; beyond these, I ask no further favor of any man, be he\npriest or layman.\"\n\n\"What comfort I can give thee thou shalt have,\" said the Abbot, in his\npatient voice, and so left the room to give the needful orders, bearing\nthe babe with him.\n\n\n\n\nV. How Otto Dwelt at St. Michaelsburg.\n\nSo the poor, little, motherless waif lived among the old monks at the\nWhite Cross on the hill, thriving and growing apace until he had reached\neleven or twelve years of age; a slender, fair-haired little fellow,\nwith a strange, quiet serious manner.\n\n\"Poor little child!\" Old Brother Benedict would sometimes say to the\nothers, \"poor little child! The troubles in which he was born must have\nbroken his wits like a glass cup. What think ye he said to me to-day?\n'Dear Brother Benedict,' said he, 'dost thou shave the hair off of the\ntop of thy head so that the dear God may see thy thoughts the better?'\nThink of that now!\" and the good old man shook with silent laughter.\n\nWhen such talk came to the good Father Abbot's ears, he smiled quietly\nto himself. \"It may be,\" said he, \"that the wisdom of little children\nflies higher than our heavy wits can follow.\"\n\nAt least Otto was not slow with his studies, and Brother Emmanuel,\nwho taught him his lessons, said more than once that, if his wits were\ncracked in other ways, they were sound enough in Latin.\n\nOtto, in a quaint, simple way which belonged to him, was gentle\nand obedient to all. But there was one among the Brethren of St.\nMichaelsburg whom he loved far above all the rest--Brother John, a poor\nhalf-witted fellow, of some twenty-five or thirty years of age. When\na very little child, he had fallen from his nurse's arms and hurt his\nhead, and as he grew up into boyhood, and showed that his wits had been\naddled by his fall, his family knew not what else to do with him, and\nso sent him off to the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg, where he lived\nhis simple, witless life upon a sort of sufferance, as though he were a\ntame, harmless animal.\n\nWhile Otto was still a little baby, he had been given into Brother\nJohn's care. Thereafter, and until Otto had grown old enough to care for\nhimself, poor Brother John never left his little charge, night or day.\nOftentimes the good Father Abbot, coming into the garden, where he loved\nto walk alone in his meditations, would find the poor, simple Brother\nsitting under the shade of the pear-tree, close to the bee-hives,\nrocking the little baby in his arms, singing strange, crazy songs to\nit, and gazing far away into the blue, empty sky with his curious, pale\neyes.\n\nAlthough, as Otto grew up into boyhood, his lessons and his tasks\nseparated him from Brother John, the bond between them seemed to grow\nstronger rather than weaker. During the hours that Otto had for his own\nthey were scarcely ever apart. Down in the vineyard, where the monks\nwere gathering the grapes for the vintage, in the garden, or in the\nfields, the two were always seen together, either wandering hand in\nhand, or seated in some shady nook or corner.\n\nBut most of all they loved to lie up in the airy wooden belfry; the\ngreat gaping bell hanging darkly above them, the mouldering cross-beams\nglimmering far up under the dim shadows of the roof, where dwelt a great\nbrown owl that, unfrightened at their familiar presence, stared down at\nthem with his round, solemn eyes. Below them stretched the white walls\nof the garden, beyond them the vineyard, and beyond that again the far\nshining river, that seemed to Otto's mind to lead into wonder-land.\nThere the two would lie upon the belfry floor by the hour, talking\ntogether of the strangest things.\n\n\"I saw the dear Angel Gabriel again yester morn,\" said Brother John.\n\n\"So!\" says Otto, seriously; \"and where was that?\"\n\n\"It was out in the garden, in the old apple-tree,\" said Brother John. \"I\nwas walking there, and my wits were running around in the grass like a\nmouse. What heard I but a wonderful sound of singing, and it was like\nthe hum of a great bee, only sweeter than honey. So I looked up into the\ntree, and there I saw two sparks. I thought at first that they were\ntwo stars that had fallen out of heaven; but what think you they were,\nlittle child?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Otto, breathlessly.\n\n\"They were angel's eyes,\" said Brother John; and he smiled in the\nstrangest way, as he gazed up into the blue sky. \"So I looked at the two\nsparks and felt happy, as one does in spring time when the cold weather\nis gone, and the warm sun shines, and the cuckoo sings again. Then,\nby-and-by, I saw the face to which the eyes belonged. First, it shone\nwhite and thin like the moon in the daylight; but it grew brighter and\nbrighter, until it hurt one's eyes to look at it, as though it had been\nthe blessed sun itself. Angel Gabriel's hand was as white as silver, and\nin it he held a green bough with blossoms, like those that grow on the\nthorn bush. As for his robe, it was all of one piece, and finer than the\nFather Abbot's linen, and shone beside like the sunlight on pure snow.\nSo I knew from all these things that it was the blessed Angel Gabriel.\"\n\n\"What do they say about this tree, Brother John?\" said he to me.\n\n\"They say it is dying, my Lord Angel,\" said I, \"and that the gardener\nwill bring a sharp axe and cut it down.\"\n\n\"'And what dost thou say about it, Brother John?' said he.\"\n\n\"'I also say yes, and that it is dying,' said I.\"\n\n\"At that he smiled until his face shone so bright that I had to shut my\neyes.\"\n\n\"'Now I begin to believe, Brother John, that thou art as foolish as men\nsay,' said he. 'Look, till I show thee.' And thereat I opened mine eyes\nagain.\"\n\n\"Then Angel Gabriel touched the dead branches with the flowery twig that\nhe held in his hand, and there was the dead wood all covered with green\nleaves, and fair blossoms and beautiful apples as yellow as gold. Each\nsmelling more sweetly than a garden of flowers, and better to the taste\nthan white bread and honey.\n\n\"'They are souls of the apples,' said the good Angel,' and they can\nnever wither and die.'\n\n\"'Then I'll tell the gardener that he shall not cut the tree down,' said\nI.\"\n\n\"'No, no,' said the dear Gabriel, 'that will never do, for if the tree\nis not cut down here on the earth, it can never be planted in paradise.'\"\n\nHere Brother John stopped short in his story, and began singing one of\nhis crazy songs, as he gazed with his pale eyes far away into nothing at\nall.\n\n\"But tell me, Brother John,\" said little Otto, in a hushed voice, \"what\nelse did the good Angel say to thee?\"\n\nBrother John stopped short in his song and began looking from right to\nleft, and up and down, as though to gather his wits.\n\n\"So!\" said he, \"there was something else that he told me. Tschk! If I\ncould but think now. Yes, good! This is it--'Nothing that has lived,'\nsaid he, 'shall ever die, and nothing that has died shall ever live.'\"\n\nOtto drew a deep breath. \"I would that I might see the beautiful Angel\nGabriel sometime,\" said he; but Brother John was singing again and did\nnot seem to hear what he said.\n\nNext to Brother John, the nearest one to the little child was the good\nAbbot Otto, for though he had never seen wonderful things with the eyes\nof his soul, such as Brother John's had beheld, and so could not tell of\nthem, he was yet able to give little Otto another pleasure that no one\nelse could give.\n\nHe was a great lover of books, the old Abbot, and had under lock and key\nwonderful and beautiful volumes, bound in hog-skin and metal, and with\ncovers inlaid with carved ivory, or studded with precious stones. But\nwithin these covers, beautiful as they were, lay the real wonder of the\nbooks, like the soul in the body; for there, beside the black letters\nand initials, gay with red and blue and gold, were beautiful pictures\npainted upon the creamy parchment. Saints and Angels, the Blessed Virgin\nwith the golden oriole about her head, good St. Joseph, the three Kings;\nthe simple Shepherds kneeling in the fields, while Angels with glories\nabout their brow called to the poor Peasants from the blue sky above.\nBut, most beautiful of all was the picture of the Christ Child lying in\nthe manger, with the mild-eyed Kine gazing at him.\n\nSometimes the old Abbot would unlock the iron-bound chest where these\ntreasures lay hidden, and carefully and lovingly brushing the few grains\nof dust from them, would lay them upon the table beside the oriel window\nin front of his little namesake, allowing the little boy freedom to turn\nthe leaves as he chose.\n\nAlways it was one picture that little Otto sought; the Christ Child in\nthe manger, with the Virgin, St. Joseph, the Shepherds, and the Kine.\nAnd as he would hang breathlessly gazing and gazing upon it, the old\nAbbot would sit watching him with a faint, half-sad smile flickering\naround his thin lips and his pale, narrow face.\n\nIt was a pleasant, peaceful life, but by-and-by the end came. Otto was\nnow nearly twelve years old.\n\nOne bright, clear day, near the hour of noon, little Otto heard the\nporter's bell sounding below in the court-yard--dong! dong! Brother\nEmmanuel had been appointed as the boy's instructor, and just then Otto\nwas conning his lessons in the good monk's cell. Nevertheless, at the\nsound of the bell he pricked up his ears and listened, for a visitor was\na strange matter in that out-of-the-way place, and he wondered who it\ncould be. So, while his wits wandered his lessons lagged.\n\n\"Postera Phoeba lustrabat lampade terras,\" continued Brother Emmanuel,\ninexorably running his horny finger-nail beneath the line, \"humentemque\nAurora polo dimoverat umbram--\" the lesson dragged along.\n\nJust then a sandaled footstep sounded without, in the stone corridor,\nand a light tap fell upon Brother Emmanuel's door. It was Brother\nIgnatius, and the Abbot wished little Otto to come to the refectory.\n\nAs they crossed the court-yard Otto stared to see a group of mail-clad\nmen-at-arms, some sitting upon their horses, some standing by the\nsaddle-bow. \"Yonder is the young baron,\" he heard one of them say in a\ngruff voice, and thereupon all turned and stared at him.\n\nA stranger was in the refectory, standing beside the good old Abbot,\nwhile food and wine were being brought and set upon the table for his\nrefreshment; a great, tall, broad-shouldered man, beside whom the Abbot\nlooked thinner and slighter than ever.\n\nThe stranger was clad all in polished and gleaming armor, of plate and\nchain, over which was drawn a loose robe of gray woollen stuff, reaching\nto the knees and bound about the waist by a broad leathern sword-belt.\nUpon his arm he carried a great helmet which he had just removed from\nhis head. His face was weather-beaten and rugged, and on lip and chin\nwas a wiry, bristling beard; once red, now frosted with white.\n\nBrother Ignatius had bidden Otto to enter, and had then closed the door\nbehind him; and now, as the lad walked slowly up the long room, he gazed\nwith round, wondering blue eyes at the stranger.\n\n\"Dost know who I am, Otto? said the mail-clad knight, in a deep,\ngrowling voice.\n\n\"Methinks you are my father, sir,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Aye, thou art right,\" said Baron Conrad, \"and I am glad to see that\nthese milk-churning monks have not allowed thee to forget me, and who\nthou art thyself.\"\n\n\"An' it please you,\" said Otto, \"no one churneth milk here but\nBrother Fritz; we be makers of wine and not makers of butter, at St.\nMichaelsburg.\"\n\nBaron Conrad broke into a great, loud laugh, but Abbot Otto's sad and\nthoughtful face lit up with no shadow of an answering smile.\n\n\"Conrad,\" said he, turning to the other, \"again let me urge thee; do\nnot take the child hence, his life can never be your life, for he is not\nfitted for it. I had thought,\" said he, after a moment's pause, \"I had\nthought that thou hadst meant to consecrate him--this motherless one--to\nthe care of the Universal Mother Church.\"\n\n\"So!\" said the Baron, \"thou hadst thought that, hadst thou? Thou hadst\nthought that I had intended to deliver over this boy, the last of the\nVuelphs, to the arms of the Church? What then was to become of our name\nand the glory of our race if it was to end with him in a monastery? No,\nDrachenhausen is the home of the Vuelphs, and there the last of the race\nshall live as his sires have lived before him, holding to his rights by\nthe power and the might of his right hand.\"\n\nThe Abbot turned and looked at the boy, who was gaping in simple\nwide-eyed wonderment from one to the other as they spoke.\n\n\"And dost thou think, Conrad,\" said the old man, in his gentle, patient\nvoice, \"that that poor child can maintain his rights by the strength of\nhis right hand?\"\n\nThe Baron's look followed the Abbot's, and he said nothing.\n\nIn the few seconds of silence that followed, little Otto, in his simple\nmind, was wondering what all this talk portended. Why had his father\ncome hither to St. Michaelsburg, lighting up the dim silence of the\nmonastery with the flash and ring of his polished armor? Why had he\ntalked about churning butter but now, when all the world knew that the\nmonks of St. Michaelsburg made wine.\n\nIt was Baron Conrad's deep voice that broke the little pause of silence.\n\n\"If you have made a milkmaid of the boy,\" he burst out at last, \"I thank\nthe dear heaven that there is yet time to undo your work and to make a\nman of him.\"\n\nThe Abbot sighed. \"The child is yours, Conrad,\" said he, \"the will of\nthe blessed saints be done. Mayhap if he goes to dwell at Drachenhausen\nhe may make you the better instead of you making him the worse.\"\n\nThen light came to the darkness of little Otto's wonderment; he saw what\nall this talk meant and why his father had come hither. He was to leave\nthe happy, sunny silence of the dear White Cross, and to go out into\nthat great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high\nwindy belfry on the steep hillside.\n\n\n\n\nVI. How Otto Lived in the Dragon's House.\n\nThe gates of the Monastery stood wide open, the world lay beyond, and\nall was ready for departure. Baron Conrad and his men-at-arms sat foot\nin stirrup, the milk-white horse that had been brought for Otto stood\nwaiting for him beside his father's great charger.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the good old Abbot, as he stooped and kissed the\nboy's cheek.\n\n\"Farewell,\" answered Otto, in his simple, quiet way, and it brought\na pang to the old man's heart that the child should seem to grieve so\nlittle at the leave-taking.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the brethren that stood about, \"farewell,\nfarewell.\"\n\nThen poor brother John came forward and took the boy's hand, and looked\nup into his face as he sat upon his horse. \"We will meet again,\" said\nhe, with his strange, vacant smile, \"but maybe it will be in Paradise,\nand there perhaps they will let us lie in the father's belfry, and look\ndown upon the angels in the court-yard below.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" answered Otto, with an answering smile.\n\n\"Forward,\" cried the Baron, in a deep voice, and with a clash of hoofs\nand jingle of armor they were gone, and the great wooden gates were shut\nto behind them.\n\nDown the steep winding pathway they rode, and out into the great wide\nworld beyond, upon which Otto and brother John had gazed so often from\nthe wooden belfry of the White Cross on the hill.\n\n\"Hast been taught to ride a horse by the priests up yonder on\nMichaelsburg?\" asked the Baron, when they had reached the level road.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto; \"we had no horse to ride, but only to bring in the\nharvest or the grapes from the further vineyards to the vintage.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said the Baron, \"methought the abbot would have had enough of\nthe blood of old days in his veins to have taught thee what is fitting\nfor a knight to know; art not afeared?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, with a smile, \"I am not afeared.\"\n\n\"There at least thou showest thyself a Vuelph,\" said the grim Baron. But\nperhaps Otto's thought of fear and Baron Conrad's thought of fear were\ntwo very different matters.\n\nThe afternoon had passed by the time they had reached the end of their\njourney. Up the steep, stony path they rode to the drawbridge and\nthe great gaping gateway of Drachenhausen, where wall and tower and\nbattlement looked darker and more forbidding than ever in the gray\ntwilight of the coming night. Little Otto looked up with great,\nwondering, awe-struck eyes at this grim new home of his.\n\nThe next moment they clattered over the drawbridge that spanned the\nnarrow black gulph between the roadway and the wall, and the next were\npast the echoing arch of the great gateway and in the gray gloaming of\nthe paved court-yard within.\n\nOtto looked around upon the many faces gathered there to catch the\nfirst sight of the little baron; hard, rugged faces, seamed and\nweather-beaten; very different from those of the gentle brethren among\nwhom he had lived, and it seemed strange to him that there was none\nthere whom he should know.\n\nAs he climbed the steep, stony steps to the door of the Baron's house,\nold Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung her withered arms\naround him and hugged him close to her. \"My little child,\" she cried,\nand then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.\n\n\"Here is someone knoweth me,\" thought the little boy.\n\nHis new home was all very strange and wonderful to Otto; the armors, the\ntrophies, the flags, the long galleries with their ranges of rooms,\nthe great hall below with its vaulted roof and its great fireplace of\ngrotesquely carved stone, and all the strange people with their lives\nand thoughts so different from what he had been used to know.\n\nAnd it was a wonderful thing to explore all the strange places in the\ndark old castle; places where it seemed to Otto no one could have ever\nbeen before.\n\nOnce he wandered down a long, dark passageway below the hall, pushed\nopen a narrow, iron-bound oaken door, and found himself all at once in\na strange new land; the gray light, coming in through a range of tall,\nnarrow windows, fell upon a row of silent, motionless figures carven in\nstone, knights and ladies in strange armor and dress; each lying upon\nhis or her stony couch with clasped hands, and gazing with fixed,\nmotionless, stony eyeballs up into the gloomy, vaulted arch above them.\nThere lay, in a cold, silent row, all of the Vuelphs who had died since\nthe ancient castle had been built.\n\nIt was the chapel into which Otto had made his way, now long since\nfallen out of use excepting as a burial place of the race.\n\nAt another time he clambered up into the loft under the high peaked\nroof, where lay numberless forgotten things covered with the dim dust\nof years. There a flock of pigeons had made their roost, and flapped\nnoisily out into the sunlight when he pushed open the door from below.\nHere he hunted among the mouldering things of the past until, oh, joy\nof joys! in an ancient oaken chest he found a great lot of worm-eaten\nbooks, that had belonged to some old chaplain of the castle in days gone\nby. They were not precious and beautiful volumes, such as the Father\nAbbot had showed him, but all the same they had their quaint painted\npictures of the blessed saints and angels.\n\nAgain, at another time, going into the court-yard, Otto had found\nthe door of Melchior's tower standing invitingly open, for old Hilda,\nSchwartz Carl's wife, had come down below upon some business or other.\n\nThen upon the shaky wooden steps Otto ran without waiting for a second\nthought, for he had often gazed at those curious buildings hanging so\nfar up in the air, and had wondered what they were like. Round and round\nand up and up Otto climbed, until his head spun. At last he reached\na landing-stage, and gazing over the edge and down, beheld the stone\npavement far, far below, lit by a faint glimmer of light that entered\nthrough the arched doorway. Otto clutched tight hold of the wooden rail,\nhe had no thought that he had climbed so far.\n\nUpon the other side of the landing was a window that pierced the thick\nstone walls of the tower; out of the window he looked, and then drew\nsuddenly back again with a gasp, for it was through the outer wall he\npeered, and down, down below in the dizzy depths he saw the hard\ngray rocks, where the black swine, looking no larger than ants in the\ndistance, fed upon the refuse thrown out over the walls of the castle.\nThere lay the moving tree-tops like a billowy green sea, and the coarse\nthatched roofs of the peasant cottages, round which crawled the little\nchildren like tiny human specks.\n\nThen Otto turned and crept down the stairs, frightened at the height to\nwhich he had climbed.\n\nAt the doorway he met Mother Hilda. \"Bless us,\" she cried, starting back\nand crossing herself, and then, seeing who it was, ducked him a courtesy\nwith as pleasant a smile as her forbidding face, with its little\ndeep-set eyes, was able to put upon itself.\n\nOld Ursela seemed nearer to the boy than anyone else about the castle,\nexcepting it was his father, and it was a newfound delight to Otto to\nsit beside her and listen to her quaint stories, so different from the\nmonkish tales that he had heard and read at the monastery.\n\nBut one day it was a tale of a different sort that she told him, and one\nthat opened his eyes to what he had never dreamed of before.\n\nThe mellow sunlight fell through the window upon old Ursela, as she sat\nin the warmth with her distaff in her hands while Otto lay close to her\nfeet upon a bear skin, silently thinking over the strange story of a\nbrave knight and a fiery dragon that she had just told him. Suddenly\nUrsela broke the silence.\n\n\"Little one,\" said she, \"thou art wondrously like thy own dear mother;\ndidst ever hear how she died?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"but tell me, Ursela, how it was.\"\n\n\"Tis strange,\" said the old woman, \"that no one should have told thee\nin all this time.\" And then, in her own fashion she related to him the\nstory of how his father had set forth upon that expedition in spite of\nall that Otto's mother had said, beseeching him to abide at home; how he\nhad been foully wounded, and how the poor lady had died from her fright\nand grief.\n\nOtto listened with eyes that grew wider and wider, though not all with\nwonder; he no longer lay upon the bear skin, but sat up with his hands\nclasped. For a moment or two after the old woman had ended her story, he\nsat staring silently at her. Then he cried out, in a sharp voice, \"And\nis this truth that you tell me, Ursela? and did my father seek to rob\nthe towns people of their goods?\"\n\nOld Ursela laughed. \"Aye,\" said she, \"that he did and many times. Ah!\nme, those day's are all gone now.\" And she fetched a deep sigh. \"Then we\nlived in plenty and had both silks and linens and velvets besides in the\nstore closets and were able to buy good wines and live in plenty upon\nthe best. Now we dress in frieze and live upon what we can get and\nsometimes that is little enough, with nothing better than sour beer to\ndrink. But there is one comfort in it all, and that is that our good\nBaron paid back the score he owed the Trutz-Drachen people not only for\nthat, but for all that they had done from the very first.\"\n\nThereupon she went on to tell Otto how Baron Conrad had fulfilled the\npledge of revenge that he had made Abbot Otto, how he had watched day\nafter day until one time he had caught the Trutz-Drachen folk,\nwith Baron Frederick at their head, in a narrow defile back of the\nKaiserburg; of the fierce fight that was there fought; of how the\nRoderburgs at last fled, leaving Baron Frederick behind them wounded; of\nhow he had kneeled before the Baron Conrad, asking for mercy, and of\nhow Baron Conrad had answered, \"Aye, thou shalt have such mercy as thou\ndeservest,\" and had therewith raised his great two-handed sword and laid\nhis kneeling enemy dead at one blow.\n\nPoor little Otto had never dreamed that such cruelty and wickedness\ncould be. He listened to the old woman's story with gaping horror, and\nwhen the last came and she told him, with a smack of her lips, how his\nfather had killed his enemy with his own hand, he gave a gasping cry and\nsprang to his feet. Just then the door at the other end of the chamber\nwas noisily opened, and Baron Conrad himself strode into the room.\nOtto turned his head, and seeing who it was, gave another cry, loud and\nquavering, and ran to his father and caught him by the hand.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" he cried, \"oh, father! Is it true that thou hast killed a\nman with thy own hand?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said the Baron, grimly, \"it is true enough, and I think me I have\nkilled many more than one. But what of that, Otto? Thou must get out of\nthose foolish notions that the old monks have taught thee. Here in the\nworld it is different from what it is at St. Michaelsburg; here a man\nmust either slay or be slain.\"\n\nBut poor little Otto, with his face hidden in his father's robe, cried\nas though his heart would break. \"Oh, father!\" he said, again and again,\n\"it cannot be--it cannot be that thou who art so kind to me should have\nkilled a man with thine own hands.\" Then: \"I wish that I were back\nin the monastery again; I am afraid out here in the great wide world;\nperhaps somebody may kill me, for I am only a weak little boy and could\nnot save my own life if they chose to take it from me.\"\n\nBaron Conrad looked down upon Otto all this while, drawing his bushy\neyebrows together. Once he reached out his hand as though to stroke the\nboy's hair, but drew it back again.\n\nTurning angrily upon the old woman, \"Ursela,\" said he, \"thou must tell\nthe child no more such stories as these; he knowest not at all of such\nthings as yet. Keep thy tongue busy with the old woman's tales that he\nloves to hear thee tell, and leave it with me to teach him what becometh\na true knight and a Vuelph.\"\n\nThat night the father and son sat together beside the roaring fire in\nthe great ball. \"Tell me, Otto,\" said the Baron, \"dost thou hate me for\nhaving done what Ursela told thee today that I did?\"\n\nOtto looked for a while into his father's face. \"I know not,\" said he at\nlast, in his quaint, quiet voice, \"but methinks that I do not hate thee\nfor it.\"\n\nThe Baron drew his bushy brows together until his eyes twinkled out of\nthe depths beneath them, then of a sudden he broke into a great loud\nlaugh, smiting his horny palm with a smack upon his thigh.\n\n\n\n\nVII. The Red Cock Crows on Drachenhausen.\n\nThere was a new emperor in Germany who had come from a far away Swiss\ncastle; Count Rudolph of Hapsburg, a good, honest man with a good,\nhonest, homely face, but bringing with him a stern sense of justice and\nof right, and a determination to put down the lawlessness of the savage\nGerman barons among whom he had come as Emperor.\n\nOne day two strangers came galloping up the winding path to the gates\nof the Dragon's house. A horn sounded thin and clear, a parley was held\nacross the chasm in the road between the two strangers and the porter\nwho appeared at the little wicket. Then a messenger was sent running to\nthe Baron, who presently came striding across the open court-yard to the\ngateway to parley with the strangers.\n\nThe two bore with them a folded parchment with a great red seal\nhanging from it like a clot of blood; it was a message from the Emperor\ndemanding that the Baron should come to the Imperial Court to answer\ncertain charges that had been brought against him, and to give his bond\nto maintain the peace of the empire.\n\nOne by one those barons who had been carrying on their private wars, or\nhad been despoiling the burgher folk in their traffic from town to\ntown, and against whom complaint had been lodged, were summoned to the\nImperial Court, where they were compelled to promise peace and to swear\nallegiance to the new order of things. All those who came willingly were\nallowed to return home again after giving security for maintaining the\npeace; all those who came not willingly were either brought in chains\nor rooted out of their strongholds with fire and sword, and their roofs\nburned over their heads.\n\nNow it was Baron Conrad's turn to be summoned to the Imperial Court,\nfor complaint had been lodged against him by his old enemy of\nTrutz-Drachen--Baron Henry--the nephew of the old Baron Frederick\nwho had been slain while kneeling in the dust of the road back of the\nKaiserburg.\n\nNo one at Drachenhausen could read but Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho was sand blind, and little Otto. So the boy read the summons to his\nfather, while the grim Baron sat silent with his chin resting upon his\nclenched fist and his eyebrows drawn together into a thoughtful frown as\nhe gazed into the pale face of his son, who sat by the rude oaken table\nwith the great parchment spread out before him.\n\nShould he answer the summons, or scorn it as he would have done under\nthe old emperors? Baron Conrad knew not which to do; pride said one\nthing and policy another. The Emperor was a man with an iron hand, and\nBaron Conrad knew what had happened to those who had refused to obey the\nimperial commands. So at last he decided that he would go to the court,\ntaking with him a suitable escort to support his dignity.\n\nIt was with nearly a hundred armed men clattering behind him that Baron\nConrad rode away to court to answer the imperial summons. The castle was\nstripped of its fighting men, and only eight remained behind to guard\nthe great stone fortress and the little simple-witted boy.\n\nIt was a sad mistake.\n\nThree days had passed since the Baron had left the castle, and now the\nthird night had come. The moon was hanging midway in the sky, white and\nfull, for it was barely past midnight.\n\nThe high precipitous banks of the rocky road threw a dense black shadow\ninto the gully below, and in that crooked inky line that scarred the\nwhite face of the moonlit rocks a band of some thirty men were creeping\nslowly and stealthily nearer and nearer to Castle Drachenhausen. At the\nhead of them was a tall, slender knight clad in light chain armor, his\nhead covered only by a steel cap or bascinet.\n\nAlong the shadow they crept, with only now and then a faint clink or\njingle of armor to break the stillness, for most of those who followed\nthe armed knight were clad in leathern jerkins; only one or two wearing\neven so much as a steel breast-plate by way of armor.\n\nSo at last they reached the chasm that yawned beneath the roadway, and\nthere they stopped, for they had reached the spot toward which they had\nbeen journeying. It was Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen who had thus come\nin the silence of the night time to the Dragon's house, and his visit\nboded no good to those within.\n\nThe Baron and two or three of his men talked together in low tones, now\nand then looking up at the sheer wall that towered above them.\n\n\"Yonder is the place, Lord Baron,\" said one of those who stood with him.\n\"I have scanned every foot of the wall at night for a week past. An we\nget not in by that way, we get not in at all. A keen eye, a true aim,\nand a bold man are all that we need, and the business is done.\" Here\nagain all looked upward at the gray wall above them, rising up in the\nsilent night air.\n\nHigh aloft hung the wooden bartizan or watch-tower, clinging to the face\nof the outer wall and looming black against the pale sky above. Three\ngreat beams pierced the wall, and upon them the wooden tower rested. The\nmiddle beam jutted out beyond the rest to the distance of five or six\nfeet, and the end of it was carved into the rude semblance of a dragon's\nhead.\n\n\"So, good,\" said the Baron at last; \"then let us see if thy plan holds,\nand if Hans Schmidt's aim is true enough to earn the three marks that I\nhave promised him. Where is the bag?\"\n\nOne of those who stood near handed the Baron a leathern pouch, the Baron\nopened it and drew out a ball of fine thread, another of twine, a coil\nof stout rope, and a great bundle that looked, until it was unrolled,\nlike a coarse fish-net. It was a rope ladder. While these were being\nmade ready, Hans Schmidt, a thick-set, low-browed, broad-shouldered\narcher, strung his stout bow, and carefully choosing three arrows\nfrom those in his quiver, he stuck them point downward in the earth.\nUnwinding the ball of thread, he laid it loosely in large loops upon the\nground so that it might run easily without hitching, then he tied the\nend of the thread tightly around one of his arrows. He fitted the arrow\nto the bow and drew the feather to his ear. Twang! rang the bowstring,\nand the feathered messenger flew whistling upon its errand to the\nwatch-tower. The very first shaft did the work.\n\n\"Good,\" said Hans Schmidt, the archer, in his heavy voice, \"the three\nmarks are mine, Lord Baron.\"\n\nThe arrow had fallen over and across the jutting beam between the carved\ndragon's head and the bartizan, carrying with it the thread, which now\nhung from above, glimmering white in the moonlight like a cobweb.\n\nThe rest was an easy task enough. First the twine was drawn up to and\nover the beam by the thread, then the rope was drawn up by the twine,\nand last of all the rope ladder by the rope. There it hung like a thin,\nslender black line against the silent gray walls.\n\n\"And now,\" said the Baron, \"who will go first and win fifty marks for\nhis own, and climb the rope ladder to the tower yonder?\" Those around\nhesitated. \"Is there none brave enough to venture?\" said the Baron,\nafter a pause of silence.\n\nA stout, young fellow, of about eighteen years of age, stepped forward\nand flung his flat leathern cap upon the ground. \"I will go, my Lord\nBaron,\" said he.\n\n\"Good,\" said the Baron, \"the fifty marks are thine. And now listen, if\nthou findest no one in the watch-tower, whistle thus; if the watchman\nbe at his post, see that thou makest all safe before thou givest the\nsignal. When all is ready the others will follow thee. And now go and\ngood luck go with thee.\"\n\nThe young fellow spat upon his hands and, seizing the ropes, began\nslowly and carefully to mount the flimsy, shaking ladder. Those below\nheld it as tight as they were able, but nevertheless he swung backward\nand forward and round and round as he climbed steadily upward. Once he\nstopped upon the way, and those below saw him clutch the ladder close\nto him as though dizzied by the height and the motion but he soon began\nagain, up, up, up like some great black spider. Presently he came out\nfrom the black shadow below and into the white moonlight, and then his\nshadow followed him step by step up the gray wall upon his way. At last\nhe reached the jutting beam, and there again he stopped for a moment\nclutching tightly to it. The next he was upon the beam, dragging himself\ntoward the window of the bartizan just above. Slowly raising himself\nupon his narrow foothold he peeped cautiously within. Those watching\nhim from be low saw him slip his hand softly to his side, and then place\nsomething between his teeth. It was his dagger. Reaching up, he clutched\nthe window sill above him and, with a silent spring, seated himself\nupon it. The next moment he disappeared within. A few seconds of silence\nfollowed, then of sudden a sharp gurgling cry broke the stillness. There\nwas another pause of silence, then a faint shrill whistle sounded from\nabove.\n\n\"Who will go next?\" said the Baron. It was Hans Schmidt who stepped\nforward. Another followed the arch up the ladder, and another, and\nanother. Last of all went the Baron Henry himself, and nothing was left\nbut the rope ladder hanging from above, and swaying back and forth in\nthe wind.\n\nThat night Schwartz Carl had been bousing it over a pot of yellow wine\nin the pantry with his old crony, Master Rudolph, the steward; and the\ntwo, chatting and gossiping together, had passed the time away until\nlong after the rest of the castle had been wrapped in sleep. Then,\nperhaps a little unsteady upon his feet, Schwartz Carl betook himself\nhomeward to the Melchior tower.\n\nHe stood for a while in the shadow of the doorway, gazing up into the\npale sky above him at the great, bright, round moon, that hung like a\nbubble above the sharp peaks of the roofs standing black as ink against\nthe sky. But all of a sudden he started up from the post against which\nhe had been leaning, and with head bent to one side, stood listening\nbreathlessly, for he too had heard that smothered cry from the\nwatch-tower. So he stood intently, motionlessly, listening, listening;\nbut all was silent except for the monotonous dripping of water in one of\nthe nooks of the court-yard, and the distant murmur of the river borne\nupon the breath of the night air. \"Mayhap I was mistaken,\" muttered\nSchwartz Carl to himself.\n\nBut the next moment the silence was broken again by a faint, shrill\nwhistle; what did it mean?\n\nBack of the heavy oaken door of the tower was Schwartz Carl's cross-bow,\nthe portable windlass with which the bowstring was drawn back, and a\npouch of bolts. Schwartz Carl reached back into the darkness, fumbling\nin the gloom until his fingers met the weapon. Setting his foot in the\niron stirrup at the end of the stock, he wound the stout bow-string\ninto the notch of the trigger, and carefully fitted the heavy,\nmurderous-looking bolt into the groove.\n\nMinute after minute passed, and Schwartz Carl, holding his arbelast in\nhis hand, stood silently waiting and watching in the sharp-cut, black\nshadow of the doorway, motionless as a stone statue. Minute after minute\npassed. Suddenly there was a movement in the shadow of the arch of the\ngreat gateway across the court-yard, and the next moment a leathern-clad\nfigure crept noiselessly out upon the moonlit pavement, and stood there\nlistening, his head bent to one side. Schwartz Carl knew very well\nthat it was no one belonging to the castle, and, from the nature of his\naction, that he was upon no good errand.\n\nHe did not stop to challenge the suspicious stranger. The taking of\nanother's life was thought too small a matter for much thought or care\nin those days. Schwartz Carl would have shot a man for a much smaller\nreason than the suspicious actions of this fellow. The leather-clad\nfigure stood a fine target in the moonlight for a cross-bow bolt.\nSchwartz Carl slowly raised the weapon to his shoulder and took a long\nand steady aim. Just then the stranger put his fingers to his lips and\ngave a low, shrill whistle. It was the last whistle that he was to give\nupon this earth. There was a sharp, jarring twang of the bow-string, the\nhiss of the flying bolt, and the dull thud as it struck its mark. The\nman gave a shrill, quavering cry, and went staggering back, and then\nfell all of a heap against the wall behind him. As though in answer to\nthe cry, half a dozen men rushed tumultuously out from the shadow of\nthe gateway whence the stranger had just come, and then stood in the\ncourt-yard, looking uncertainly this way and that, not knowing from what\nquarter the stroke had come that had laid their comrade low.\n\nBut Schwartz Carl did not give them time to discover that; there was no\nchance to string his cumbersome weapon again; down he flung it upon the\nground. \"To arms!\" he roared in a voice of thunder, and then clapped to\nthe door of Melchior's tower and shot the great iron bolts with a clang\nand rattle.\n\nThe next instant the Trutz-Drachen men were thundering at the door, but\nSchwartz Carl was already far up the winding steps.\n\nBut now the others came pouring out from the gateway. \"To the house,\"\nroared Baron Henry.\n\nThen suddenly a clashing, clanging uproar crashed out upon the night.\nDong! Dong! It was the great alarm bell from Melchior's tower--Schwartz\nCarl was at his post.\n\nLittle Baron Otto lay sleeping upon the great rough bed in his room,\ndreaming of the White Cross on the hill and of brother John. By and by\nhe heard the convent bell ringing, and knew that there must be visitors\nat the gate, for loud voices sounded through his dream. Presently he\nknew that he was coming awake, but though the sunny monastery garden\ngrew dimmer and dimmer to his sleeping sight, the clanging of the bell\nand the sound of shouts grew louder and louder. Then he opened his eyes.\nFlaming red lights from torches, carried hither and thither by people\nin the court-yard outside, flashed and ran along the wall of his\nroom. Hoarse shouts and cries filled the air, and suddenly the shrill,\npiercing shriek of a woman rang from wall to wall; and through the\nnoises the great bell from far above upon Melchior's tower clashed and\nclanged its harsh, resonant alarm.\n\nOtto sprang from his bed and looked out of the window and down upon\nthe court-yard below. \"Dear God! what dreadful thing hath happened?\" he\ncried and clasped his hands together.\n\nA cloud of smoke was pouring out from the windows of the building across\nthe court-yard, whence a dull ruddy glow flashed and flickered. Strange\nmen were running here and there with flaming torches, and the now\ncontinuous shrieking of women pierced the air.\n\nJust beneath the window lay the figure of a man half naked and face\ndownward upon the stones. Then suddenly Otto cried out in fear and\nhorror, for, as he looked with dazed and bewildered eyes down into the\nlurid court-yard beneath, a savage man, in a shining breast-plate and\nsteel cap, came dragging the dark, silent figure of a woman across the\nstones; but whether she was dead or in a swoon, Otto could not tell.\n\nAnd every moment the pulsing of that dull red glare from the windows of\nthe building across the court-yard shone more brightly, and the glare\nfrom other flaming buildings, which Otto could not see from his window,\nturned the black, starry night into a lurid day.\n\nJust then the door of the room was burst open, and in rushed poor old\nUrsela, crazy with her terror. She flung herself down upon the floor and\ncaught Otto around the knees. \"Save me!\" she cried, \"save me!\" as though\nthe poor, pale child could be of any help to her at such a time. In the\npassageway without shone the light of torches, and the sound of loud\nfootsteps came nearer and nearer.\n\nAnd still through all the din sounded continually the clash and clang\nand clamor of the great alarm bell.\n\nThe red light flashed into the room, and in the doorway stood a tall,\nthin figure clad from head to foot in glittering chain armor. From\nbehind this fierce knight, with his dark, narrow, cruel face, its\ndeep-set eyes glistening in the light of the torches, crowded six or\neight savage, low-browed, brutal men, who stared into the room and\nat the white-faced boy as he stood by the window with the old woman\nclinging to his knees and praying to him for help.\n\n\"We have cracked the nut and here is the kernel,\" said one of them who\nstood behind the rest, and thereupon a roar of brutal laughter went up.\nBut the cruel face of the armed knight never relaxed into a smile;\nhe strode into the room and laid his iron hand heavily upon the boy's\nshoulder. \"Art thou the young Baron Otto?\" said he, in a harsh voice.\n\n\"Aye,\" said the lad; \"but do not kill me.\"\n\nThe knight did not answer him. \"Fetch the cord hither,\" said he, \"and\ndrag the old witch away.\"\n\nIt took two of them to loosen poor old Ursela's crazy clutch from about\nher young master. Then amid roars of laughter they dragged her away,\nscreaming and scratching and striking with her fists.\n\nThey drew back Otto's arms behind his back and wrapped them round and\nround with a bowstring. Then they pushed and hustled and thrust him\nforth from the room and along the passageway, now bright with the flames\nthat roared and crackled without. Down the steep stairway they drove\nhim, where thrice he stumbled and fell amid roars of laughter. At last\nthey were out into the open air of the court-yard. Here was a terrible\nsight, but Otto saw nothing of it; his blue eyes were gazing far away,\nand his lips moved softly with the prayer that the good monks of St.\nMichaelsburg had taught him, for he thought that they meant to slay him.\n\nAll around the court-yard the flames roared and snapped and crackled.\nFour or five figures lay scattered here and there, silent in all the\nglare and uproar. The heat was so intense that they were soon forced\nback into the shelter of the great gateway, where the women captives,\nunder the guard of three or four of the Trutz-Drachen men, were crowded\ntogether in dumb, bewildered terror. Only one man was to be seen among\nthe captives, poor, old, half blind Master Rudolph, the steward,\nwho crouched tremblingly among the women. They had set the blaze to\nMelchior's tower, and now, below, it was a seething furnace. Above, the\nsmoke rolled in black clouds from the windows, but still the alarm bell\nsounded through all the blaze and smoke. Higher and higher the flames\nrose; a trickle of fire ran along the frame buildings hanging aloft in\nthe air. A clear flame burst out at the peak of the roof, but still the\nbell rang forth its clamorous clangor. Presently those who watched below\nsaw the cluster of buildings bend and sink and sway; there was a crash\nand roar, a cloud of sparks flew up as though to the very heavens\nthemselves, and the bell of Melchior's tower was stilled forever. A\ngreat shout arose from the watching, upturned faces.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, and out from the gateway they swept and\nacross the drawbridge, leaving Drachenhausen behind them a flaming\nfurnace blazing against the gray of the early dawning.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. In the House of the Dragon Scorner.\n\nTall, narrow, gloomy room; no furniture but a rude bench a bare stone\nfloor, cold stone walls and a gloomy ceiling of arched stone over head;\na long, narrow slit of a window high above in the wall, through the iron\nbars of which Otto could see a small patch of blue sky and now and then\na darting swallow, for an instant seen, the next instant gone. Such\nwas the little baron's prison in Trutz-Drachen. Fastened to a bolt\nand hanging against the walls, hung a pair of heavy chains with gaping\nfetters at the ends. They were thick with rust, and the red stain of\nthe rust streaked the wall below where they hung like a smear of blood.\nLittle Otto shuddered as he looked at them; can those be meant for me,\nhe thought.\n\nNothing was to be seen but that one patch of blue sky far up in the\nwall. No sound from without was to be heard in that gloomy cell of\nstone, for the window pierced the outer wall, and the earth and its\nnoises lay far below.\n\nSuddenly a door crashed without, and the footsteps of men were heard\ncoming along the corridor. They stopped in front of Otto's cell; he\nheard the jingle of keys, and then a loud rattle of one thrust into\nthe lock of the heavy oaken door. The rusty bolt was shot back with a\nscreech, the door opened, and there stood Baron Henry, no longer in his\narmor, but clad in a long black robe that reached nearly to his feet,\na broad leather belt was girdled about his waist, and from it dangled a\nshort, heavy hunting sword.\n\nAnother man was with the Baron, a heavy-faced fellow clad in a leathern\njerkin over which was drawn a short coat of linked mail.\n\nThe two stood for a moment looking into the room, and Otto, his pale\nface glimmering in the gloom, sat upon the edge of the heavy wooden\nbench or bed, looking back at them out of his great blue eyes. Then the\ntwo entered and closed the door behind them.\n\n\"Dost thou know why thou art here?\" said the Baron, in his deep, harsh\nvoice.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I know not.\"\n\n\"So?\" said the Baron. \"Then I will tell thee. Three years ago the good\nBaron Frederick, my uncle, kneeled in the dust and besought mercy at thy\nfather's hands; the mercy he received was the coward blow that slew him.\nThou knowest the story?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, tremblingly, \"I know it.\"\n\n\"Then dost thou not know why I am here?\" said the Baron.\n\n\"Nay, dear Lord Baron, I know not,\" said poor little Otto, and began to\nweep.\n\nThe Baron stood for a moment or two looking gloomily upon him, as the\nlittle boy sat there with the tears running down his white face.\n\n\"I will tell thee,\" said he, at last; \"I swore an oath that the red cock\nshould crow on Drachenhausen, and I have given it to the dames. I swore\nan oath that no Vuelph that ever left my hands should be able to strike\nsuch a blow as thy father gave to Baron Frederick, and now I will fulfil\nthat too. Catch the boy, Casper, and hold him.\"\n\nAs the man in the mail shirt stepped toward little Otto, the boy leaped\nup from where he sat and caught the Baron about the knees. \"Oh! dear\nLord Baron,\" he cried, \"do not harm me; I am only a little child, I have\nnever done harm to thee; do not harm me.\"\n\n\"Take him away,\" said the Baron, harshly.\n\nThe fellow stooped, and loosening Otto's hold, in spite of his struggles\nand cries, carried him to the bench, against which he held him, whilst\nthe Baron stood above him.\n\nBaron Henry and the other came forth from the cell, carefully closing\nthe wooden door behind them. At the end of the corridor the Baron\nturned, \"Let the leech be sent to the boy,\" said he. And then he turned\nand walked away.\n\nOtto lay upon the hard couch in his cell, covered with a shaggy bear\nskin. His face was paler and thinner than ever, and dark rings encircled\nhis blue eyes. He was looking toward the door, for there was a noise of\nsomeone fumbling with the lock without.\n\nSince that dreadful day when Baron Henry had come to his cell, only two\nsouls had visited Otto. One was the fellow who had come with the Baron\nthat time; his name, Otto found, was Casper. He brought the boy his rude\nmeals of bread and meat and water. The other visitor was the leech or\ndoctor, a thin, weasand little man, with a kindly, wrinkled face and a\ngossiping tongue, who, besides binding wounds, bleeding, and leeching,\nand administering his simple remedies to those who were taken sick in\nthe castle, acted as the Baron's barber.\n\nThe Baron had left the key in the lock of the door, so that these two\nmight enter when they chose, but Otto knew that it was neither the one\nnor the other whom he now heard at the door, working uncertainly with\nthe key, striving to turn it in the rusty, cumbersome lock. At last the\nbolts grated back, there was a pause, and then the door opened a little\nway, and Otto thought that he could see someone peeping in from without.\nBy and by the door opened further, there was another pause, and then\na slender, elfish-looking little girl, with straight black hair and\nshining black eyes, crept noiselessly into the room.\n\nShe stood close by the door with her finger in her mouth, staring at\nthe boy where he lay upon his couch, and Otto upon his part lay, full of\nwonder, gazing back upon the little elfin creature.\n\nShe, seeing that he made no sign or motion, stepped a little nearer, and\nthen, after a moment's pause, a little nearer still, until, at last, she\nstood within a few feet of where he lay.\n\n\"Art thou the Baron Otto?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Otto.\n\n\"Prut!\" said she, \"and is that so! Why, I thought that thou wert a great\ntall fellow at least, and here thou art a little boy no older than Carl\nMax, the gooseherd.\" Then, after a little pause--\"My name is Pauline,\nand my father is the Baron. I heard him tell my mother all about thee,\nand so I wanted to come here and see thee myself: Art thou sick?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"I am sick.\"\n\n\"And did my father hurt thee?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, and his eyes filled with tears, until one sparkling\ndrop trickled slowly down his white face.\n\nLittle Pauline stood looking seriously at him for a while. \"I am sorry\nfor thee, Otto,\" said she, at last. And then, at her childish pity, he\nbegan crying in earnest.\n\nThis was only the first visit of many from the little maid, for after\nthat she often came to Otto's prison, who began to look for her coming\nfrom day to day as the one bright spot in the darkness and the gloom.\n\nSitting upon the edge of his bed and gazing into his face with wide open\neyes, she would listen to him by the hour, as he told her of his life in\nthat far away monastery home; of poor, simple brother John's wonderful\nvisions, of the good Abbot's books with their beautiful pictures, and of\nall the monkish tales and stories of knights and dragons and heroes and\nemperors of ancient Rome, which brother Emmanuel had taught him to read\nin the crabbed monkish Latin in which they were written.\n\nOne day the little maid sat for a long while silent after he had ended\nspeaking. At last she drew a deep breath. \"And are all these things that\nthou tellest me about the priests in their castle really true?\" said\nshe.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"all are true.\"\n\n\"And do they never go out to fight other priests?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Otto, \"they know nothing of fighting.\"\n\n\"So!\" said she. And then fell silent in the thought of the wonder of\nit all, and that there should be men in the world that knew nothing of\nviolence and bloodshed; for in all the eight years of her life she had\nscarcely been outside of the walls of Castle Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt another time it was of Otto's mother that they were speaking.\n\n\"And didst thou never see her, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"I see her sometimes in my dreams, and her face always\nshines so bright that I know she is an angel; for brother John has often\nseen the dear angels, and he tells me that their faces always shine in\nthat way. I saw her the night thy father hurt me so, for I could not\nsleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder. Then she\ncame and leaned over me and kissed my forehead, and after that I fell\nasleep.\"\n\n\"But where did she come from, Otto?\" said the little girl.\n\n\"From paradise, I think,\" said Otto, with that patient seriousness that\nhe had caught from the monks, and that sat so quaintly upon him.\n\n\"So!\" said little Pauline; and then, after a pause, \"That is why thy\nmother kissed thee when thy head ached--because she is an angel. When\nI was sick my mother bade Gretchen carry me to a far part of the house,\nbecause I cried and so troubled her. Did thy mother ever strike thee,\nOtto?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Mine hath often struck me,\" said Pauline.\n\nOne day little Pauline came bustling into Otto's cell, her head full of\nthe news which she carried. \"My father says that thy father is out\nin the woods somewhere yonder, back of the castle, for Fritz, the\nswineherd, told my father that last night he had seen a fire in the\nwoods, and that he had crept up to it without anyone knowing. There he\nhad seen the Baron Conrad and six of his men, and that they were eating\none of the swine that they had killed and roasted. Maybe,\" said she,\nseating herself upon the edge of Otto's couch; \"maybe my father will\nkill thy father, and they will bring him here and let him lie upon a\nblack bed with bright candles burning around him, as they did my uncle\nFrederick when he was killed.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" said Otto, and then lay for a while with his hands\nclasped. \"Dost thou love me, Pauline?\" said he, after a while.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pauline, \"for thou art a good child, though my father says\nthat thy wits are cracked.\"\n\n\"Mayhap they are,\" said Otto, simply, \"for I have often been told so\nbefore. But thou wouldst not see me die, Pauline; wouldst thou?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Pauline, \"I would not see thee die, for then thou couldst\ntell me no more stories; for they told me that uncle Frederick could not\nspeak because he was dead.\"\n\n\"Then listen, Pauline,\" said Otto; \"if I go not away from here I shall\nsurely die. Every day I grow more sick and the leech cannot cure me.\"\nHere he broke down and, turning his face upon the couch, began crying,\nwhile little Pauline sat looking seriously at him.\n\n\"Why dost thou cry, Otto?\" said she, after a while.\n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"I am so sick, and I want my father to come and take\nme away from here.\"\n\n\"But why dost thou want to go away?\" said Pauline. \"If thy father takes\nthee away, thou canst not tell me any more stories.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" said Otto, \"for when I grow to be a man I will come\nagain and marry thee, and when thou art my wife I can tell thee all the\nstories that I know. Dear Pauline, canst thou not tell my father where I\nam, that he may come here and take me away before I die?\"\n\n\"Mayhap I could do so,\" said Pauline, after a little while, \"for\nsometimes I go with Casper Max to see his mother, who nursed me when I\nwas a baby. She is the wife of Fritz, the swineherd, and she will make\nhim tell thy father; for she will do whatever I ask of her, and Fritz\nwill do whatever she bids him do.\"\n\n\"And for my sake, wilt thou tell him, Pauline?\" said Otto.\n\n\"But see, Otto,\" said the little girl, \"if I tell him, wilt thou promise\nto come indeed and marry me when thou art grown a man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, very seriously, \"I will promise.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell thy father where thou art,\" said she.\n\n\"But thou wilt do it without the Baron Henry knowing, wilt thou not,\nPauline?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"for if my father and my mother knew that I did such\na thing, they would strike me, mayhap send me to my bed alone in the\ndark.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX. How One-eyed Hans came to Trutz-Drachen.\n\nFritz, the swineherd, sat eating his late supper of porridge out of a\ngreat, coarse, wooden bowl; wife Katherine sat at the other end of the\ntable, and the half-naked little children played upon the earthen floor.\nA shaggy dog lay curled up in front of the fire, and a grunting pig\nscratched against a leg of the rude table close beside where the woman\nsat.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Katherine, speaking of the matter of which they had\nalready been talking. \"It is all very true that the Drachenhausens are a\nbad lot, and I for one am of no mind to say no to that; all the same it\nis a sad thing that a simple-witted little child like the young Baron\nshould be so treated as the boy has been; and now that our Lord Baron\nhas served him so that he, at least, will never be able to do us 'harm,\nI for one say that he should not be left there to die alone in that\nblack cell.\"\n\nFritz, the swineherd, gave a grunt at this without raising his eyes from\nthe bowl.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" said Katherine, \"I know what thou meanest, Fritz, and that\nit is none of my business to be thrusting my finger into the Baron's\ndish. But to hear the way that dear little child spoke when she was here\nthis morn--it would have moved a heart of stone to hear her tell of all\nhis pretty talk. Thou wilt try to let the red-beard know that that poor\nboy, his son, is sick to death in the black cell; wilt thou not, Fritz?\"\n\nThe swineherd dropped his wooden spoon into the bowl with a clatter.\n\"Potstausand!\" he cried; \"art thou gone out of thy head to let thy wits\nrun upon such things as this of which thou talkest to me? If it should\ncome to our Lord Baron's ears he would cut the tongue from out thy head\nand my head from off my shoulders for it. Dost thou think I am going to\nmeddle in such a matter as this? Listen! these proud Baron folk, with\ntheir masterful ways, drive our sort hither and thither; they beat us,\nthey drive us, they kill us as they choose. Our lives are not as much\nto them as one of my black swine. Why should I trouble my head if they\nchoose to lop and trim one another? The fewer there are of them the\nbetter for us, say I. We poor folk have a hard enough life of it without\nthrusting our heads into the noose to help them out of their troubles.\nWhat thinkest thou would happen to us if Baron Henry should hear of our\nbetraying his affairs to the Red-beard?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Katherine, \"thou hast naught to do in the matter but to tell\nthe Red-beard in what part of the castle the little Baron lies.\"\n\n\"And what good would that do?\" said Fritz, the swineherd.\n\n\"I know not,\" said Katherine, \"but I have promised the little one that\nthou wouldst find the Baron Conrad and tell him that much.\"\n\n\"Thou hast promised a mare's egg,\" said her husband, angrily. \"How shall\nI find the Baron Conrad to bear a message to him, when our Baron has\nbeen looking for him in vain for two days past?\"\n\n\"Thou has found him once and thou mayst find him again,\" said Katherine,\n\"for it is not likely that he will keep far away from here whilst his\nboy is in such sore need of help.\"\n\n\"I will have nothing to do with it!\" said Fritz, and he got up from the\nwooden block whereon he was sitting and stumped out of the house. But,\nthen, Katherine had heard him talk in that way before, and knew, in\nspite of his saying \"no,\" that, sooner or later, he would do as she\nwished.\n\nTwo days later a very stout little one-eyed man, clad in a leathern\njerkin and wearing a round leathern cap upon his head, came toiling up\nthe path to the postern door of Trutz-Drachen, his back bowed under the\nburthen of a great peddler's pack. It was our old friend the one-eyed\nHans, though even his brother would hardly have known him in his present\nguise, for, besides having turned peddler, he had grown of a sudden\nsurprisingly fat.\n\nRap-tap-tap! He knocked at the door with a knotted end of the crooked\nthorned staff upon which he leaned. He waited for a while and then\nknocked again--rap-tap-tap!\n\nPresently, with a click, a little square wicket that pierced the door\nwas opened, and a woman's face peered out through the iron bars.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans whipped off his leathern cap.\n\n\"Good day, pretty one,\" said he, \"and hast thou any need of glass beads,\nribbons, combs, or trinkets? Here I am come all the way from Gruenstadt,\nwith a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before.\nHere be rings and bracelets and necklaces that might be of pure silver\nand set with diamonds and rubies, for anything that thy dear one could\ntell if he saw thee decked in them. And all are so cheap that thou hast\nonly to say, 'I want them,' and they are thine.\"\n\nThe frightened face at the window looked from right to left and from\nleft to right. \"Hush,\" said the girl, and laid her finger upon her lips.\n\"There! thou hadst best get away from here, poor soul, as fast as thy\nlegs can carry thee, for if the Lord Baron should find thee here talking\nsecretly at the postern door, he would loose the wolf-hounds upon thee.\"\n\n\"Prut,\" said one-eyed Hans, with a grin, \"the Baron is too big a fly to\nsee such a little gnat as I; but wolf-hounds or no wolf-hounds, I\ncan never go hence without showing thee the pretty things that I have\nbrought from the town, even though my stay be at the danger of my own\nhide.\"\n\nHe flung the pack from off his shoulders as he spoke and fell to\nunstrapping it, while the round face of the lass (her eyes big with\ncuriosity) peered down at him through the grated iron bars.\n\nHans held up a necklace of blue and white beads that glistened like\njewels in the sun, and from them hung a gorgeous filigree cross. \"Didst\nthou ever see a sweeter thing than this?\" said he; \"and look, here is a\ncomb that even the silversmith would swear was pure silver all the way\nthrough.\" Then, in a soft, wheedling voice, \"Canst thou not let me in,\nmy little bird? Sure there are other lasses besides thyself who would\nlike to trade with a poor peddler who has travelled all the way from\nGruenstadt just to please the pretty ones of Trutz-Drachen.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the lass, in a frightened voice, \"I cannot let thee in; I\nknow not what the Baron would do to me, even now, if he knew that I was\nhere talking to a stranger at the postern;\" and she made as if she would\nclap to the little window in his face; but the one-eyed Hans thrust his\nstaff betwixt the bars and so kept the shutter open.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said he, eagerly, \"do not go away from me too soon. Look,\ndear one; seest thou this necklace?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said she, looking hungrily at it.\n\n\"Then listen; if thou wilt but let me into the castle, so that I may\nstrike a trade, I will give it to thee for thine own without thy paying\na barley corn for it.\"\n\nThe girl looked and hesitated, and then looked again; the temptation was\ntoo great. There was a noise of softly drawn bolts and bars, the door\nwas hesitatingly opened a little way, and, in a twinkling, the one-eyed\nHans had slipped inside the castle, pack and all.\n\n\"The necklace,\" said the girl, in a frightened whisper.\n\nHans thrust it into her hand. \"It's thine,\" said he, \"and now wilt thou\nnot help me to a trade?\"\n\n\"I will tell my sister that thou art here,\" said she, and away she ran\nfrom the little stone hallway, carefully bolting and locking the further\ndoor behind her.\n\nThe door that the girl had locked was the only one that connected the\npostern hail with the castle.\n\nThe one-eyed Hans stood looking after her. \"Thou fool!\" he muttered to\nhimself, \"to lock the door behind thee. What shall I do next, I should\nlike to know? Here am I just as badly off as I was when I stood outside\nthe walls. Thou hussy! If thou hadst but let me into the castle for only\ntwo little minutes, I would have found somewhere to have hidden myself\nwhile thy back was turned. But what shall I do now?\" He rested his pack\nupon the floor and stood looking about him.\n\nBuilt in the stone wall opposite to him, was a high, narrow fireplace\nwithout carving of any sort. As Hans' one eye wandered around the bare\nstone space, his glance fell at last upon it, and there it rested. For\na while he stood looking intently at it, presently he began rubbing his\nhand over his bristling chin in a thoughtful, meditative manner. Finally\nhe drew a deep breath, and giving himself a shake as though to arouse\nhimself from his thoughts, and after listening a moment or two to\nmake sure that no one was nigh, he walked softly to the fireplace, and\nstooping, peered up the chimney. Above him yawned a black cavernous\ndepth, inky with the soot of years. Hans straightened himself, and\ntilting his leathern cap to one side, began scratching his bullet-head;\nat last he drew a long breath. \"Yes, good,\" he muttered to himself; \"he\nwho jumps into the river must e'en swim the best he can. It is a vile,\ndirty place to thrust one's self; but I am in for it now, and must make\nthe best of a lame horse.\"\n\nHe settled the cap more firmly upon his head, spat upon his hands, and\nonce more stooping in the fireplace, gave a leap, and up the chimney he\nwent with a rattle of loose mortar and a black trickle of soot.\n\nBy and by footsteps sounded outside the door. There was a pause; a\nhurried whispering of women's voices; the twitter of a nervous laugh,\nand then the door was pushed softly opens and the girl to whom the\none-eyed Hans had given the necklace of blue and white beads with the\nfiligree cross hanging from it, peeped uncertainly into the room. Behind\nher broad, heavy face were three others, equally homely and stolid; for\na while all four stood there, looking blankly into the room and around\nit. Nothing was there but the peddler's knapsack lying in the middle of\nthe floor-the man was gone. The light of expectancy slowly faded Out of\nthe girl's face, and in its place succeeded first bewilderment and then\ndull alarm. \"But, dear heaven,\" she said, \"where then has the peddler\nman gone?\"\n\nA moment or two of silence followed her speech. \"Perhaps,\" said one of\nthe others, in a voice hushed with awe, \"perhaps it was the evil one\nhimself to whom thou didst open the door.\"\n\nAgain there was a hushed and breathless pause; it was the lass who had\nlet Hans in at the postern, who next spoke.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, in a voice trembling with fright at what she had done,\n\"yes, it must have been the evil one, for now I remember he had but one\neye.\" The four girls crossed themselves, and their eyes grew big and\nround with the fright.\n\nSuddenly a shower of mortar came rattling down the chimney. \"Ach!\" cried\nthe four, as with one voice. Bang! the door was clapped to and away they\nscurried like a flock of frightened rabbits.\n\nWhen Jacob, the watchman, came that way an hour later, upon his evening\nround of the castle, he found a peddler's knapsack lying in the middle\nof the floor. He turned it over with his pike-staff and saw that it was\nfull of beads and trinkets and ribbons.\n\n\"How came this here?\" said he. And then, without waiting for the answer\nwhich he did not expect, he flung it over his shoulder and marched away\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\nX. How Hans Brought Terror to the Kitchen.\n\nHans found himself in a pretty pickle in the chimney, for the soot got\ninto his one eye and set it to watering, and into his nose and set him\nto sneezing, and into his mouth and his ears and his hair. But still\nhe struggled on, up and up; \"for every chimney has a top,\" said Hans\nto himself \"and I am sure to climb out somewhere or other.\" Suddenly he\ncame to a place where another chimney joined the one he was climbing,\nand here he stopped to consider the matter at his leisure. \"See now,\" he\nmuttered, \"if I still go upward I may come out at the top of some tall\nchimney-stack with no way of getting down outside. Now, below here\nthere must be a fire-place somewhere, for a chimney does not start from\nnothing at all; yes, good! we will go down a while and see what we make\nof that.\"\n\nIt was a crooked, zigzag road that he had to travel, and rough and hard\ninto the bargain. His one eye tingled and smarted, and his knees and\nelbows were rubbed to the quick; nevertheless One-eyed Hans had been in\nworse trouble than this in his life.\n\nDown he went and down he went, further than he had climbed upward\nbefore. \"Sure, I must be near some place or other,\" he thought.\n\nAs though in instant answer to his thoughts, he heard the sudden sound\nof a voice so close beneath him that he stopped short in his downward\nclimbing and stood as still as a mouse, with his heart in his mouth.\nA few inches more and he would have been discovered;--what would have\nhappened then would have been no hard matter to foretell.\n\nHans braced his back against one side of the chimney, his feet against\nthe other and then, leaning forward, looked down between his knees. The\ngray light of the coming evening glimmered in a wide stone fireplace\njust below him. Within the fireplace two people were moving about upon\nthe broad hearth, a great, fat woman and a shock-headed boy. The woman\nheld a spit with two newly trussed fowls upon it, so that One-eyed Hans\nknew that she must be the cook.\n\n\"Thou ugly toad,\" said the woman to the boy, \"did I not bid thee make a\nfire an hour ago? and now, here there is not so much as a spark to roast\nthe fowls withall, and they to be basted for the lord Baron's supper.\nWhere hast thou been for all this time?\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said the boy, sullenly, as he laid the fagots ready for the\nlighting; \"no matter, I was not running after Long Jacob, the bowman, to\ntry to catch him for a sweetheart, as thou hast been doing.\"\n\nThe reply was instant and ready. The cook raised her hand; \"smack!\" she\nstruck and a roar from the scullion followed.\n\n\"Yes, good,\" thought Hans, as he looked down upon them; \"I am glad that\nthe boy's ear was not on my head.\"\n\n\"Now give me no more of thy talk,\" said the woman, \"but do the work\nthat thou hast been bidden.\" Then--\"How came all this black soot here, I\nshould like to know?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\" snuffled the scullion, \"mayhap thou wouldst blame\nthat on me also?\"\n\n\"That is my doing,\" whispered Hans to himself; \"but if they light the\nfire, what then becomes of me?\"\n\n\"See now,\" said the cook; \"I go to make the cakes ready; if I come back\nand find that thou hast not built the fire, I will warm thy other ear\nfor thee.\"\n\n\"So,\" thought Hans; \"then will be my time to come down the chimney, for\nthere will be but one of them.\"\n\nThe next moment he heard the door close and knew that the cook had gone\nto make the cakes ready as she said. And as he looked down he saw that\nthe boy was bending over the bundle of fagots, blowing the spark that\nhe had brought in upon the punk into a flame. The dry fagots began to\ncrackle and blaze. \"Now is my time,\" said Hans to himself. Bracing his\nelbows against each side of the chimney, he straightened his legs so\nthat he might fall clear His motions loosened little shower of soot that\nfell rattling upon the fagots that were now beginning to blaze brightly,\nwhereupon the boy raised his face and looked up. Hans loosened his hold\nupon the chimney; crash! he fell, lighting upon his feet in the midst\nof the burning fagots. The scullion boy tumbled backward upon the floor,\nwhere he lay upon the broad of his back with a face as white as\ndough and eyes and mouth agape, staring speechlessly at the frightful\ninky-black figure standing in the midst of the flames and smoke. Then\nhis scattered wits came back to him. \"It is the evil one,\" he roared.\nAnd thereupon, turning upon his side, he half rolled, half scrambled to\nthe door. Then out he leaped and, banging it to behind him, flew down\nthe passageway, yelling with fright and never daring once to look behind\nhim.\n\nAll the time One-eyed Hans was brushing away the sparks that clung to\nhis clothes. He was as black as ink from head to foot with the soot from\nthe chimney.\n\n\"So far all is good,\" he muttered to himself, \"but if I go wandering\nabout in my sooty shoes I will leave black tracks to follow me, so there\nis nothing to do but e'en to go barefoot.\"\n\nHe stooped and drawing the pointed soft leather shoes from his feet, he\nthrew them upon the now blazing fagots, where they writhed and twisted\nand wrinkled, and at last burst into a flame. Meanwhile Hans lost no\ntime; he must find a hiding-place, and quickly, if he would yet hope\nto escape. A great bread trough stood in the corner of the kitchen--a\nhopper-shaped chest with a flat lid. It was the best hiding place that\nthe room afforded. Without further thought Hans ran to it, snatching up\nfrom the table as he passed a loaf of black bread and a bottle half full\nof stale wine, for he had had nothing to eat since that morning. Into\nthe great bread trough he climbed, and drawing the lid down upon him,\ncurled himself up as snugly as a mouse in its nest.\n\nFor a while the kitchen lay in silence, but at last the sound of voices\nwas heard at the door, whispering together in low tones. Suddenly the\ndoor was flung open and a tall, lean, lantern-jawed fellow, clad in\nrough frieze, strode into the room and stood there glaring with half\nfrightened boldness around about him; three or four women and the\ntrembling scullion crowded together in a frightened group behind him.\n\nThe man was Long Jacob, the bowman; but, after all, his boldness was\nall wasted, for not a thread or a hair was to be seen, but only the\ncrackling fire throwing its cheerful ruddy glow upon the wall of the\nroom, now rapidly darkening in the falling gray of the twilight without.\n\nThe fat cook's fright began rapidly to turn into anger.\n\n\"Thou imp,\" she cried, \"it is one of thy tricks,\" and she made a dive\nfor the scullion, who ducked around the skirts of one of the other women\nand so escaped for the time; but Long Jacob wrinkled up his nose and\nsniffed. \"Nay,\" said he, \"me thinks that there lieth some truth in the\ntale that the boy hath told, for here is a vile smell of burned horn\nthat the black one bath left behind him.\"\n\nIt was the smell from the soft leather shoes that Hans had burned.\n\nThe silence of night had fallen over the Castle of Trutz-Drachen; not\na sound was heard but the squeaking of mice scurring behind the\nwainscoting, the dull dripping of moisture from the eaves, or the\nsighing of the night wind around the gables and through the naked\nwindows of the castle.\n\nThe lid of the great dough trough was softly raised, and a face, black\nwith soot, peeped cautiously out from under it. Then little by little\narose a figure as black as the face; and One-eyed Hans stepped out upon\nthe floor, stretching and rubbing himself.\n\n\"Methinks I must have slept,\" he muttered. \"Hui, I am as stiff as a new\nleather doublet, and now, what next is to become of me? I hope my luck\nmay yet stick to me, in spite of this foul black soot!\"\n\nAlong the middle of the front of the great hall of the castle, ran a\nlong stone gallery, opening at one end upon the court-yard by a high\nflight of stone steps. A man-at-arms in breast-plate and steel cap, and\nbearing a long pike, paced up and down the length of this gallery, now\nand then stopping, leaning over the edge, and gazing up into the starry\nsky above; then, with a long drawn yawn, lazily turning back to the\nmonotonous watch again.\n\nA dark figure crept out from an arched doorway at the lower part of the\nlong straight building, and some little distance below the end gallery,\nbut the sentry saw nothing of it, for his back was turned. As silently\nand as stealthily as a cat the figure crawled along by the dark shadowy\nwall, now and then stopping, and then again creeping slowly forward\ntoward the gallery where the man-at-arms moved monotonously up and down.\nIt was One-eyed Hans in his bare feet.\n\nInch by inch, foot by foot--the black figure crawled along in the angle\nof the wall; inch by inch and foot by foot, but ever nearer and nearer\nto the long straight row of stone steps that led to the covered gallery.\nAt last it crouched at the lowest step of the flight. Just then the\nsentinel upon watch came to the very end of the gallery and stood there\nleaning upon his spear. Had he looked down below he could not have\nfailed to have seen One-eyed Hans lying there motionlessly; but he was\ngazing far away over the steep black roofs beyond, and never saw the\nunsuspected presence. Minute after minute passed, and the one stood\nthere looking out into the night and the other lay crouching by the\nwall; then with a weary sigh the sentry turned and began slowly pacing\nback again toward the farther end of the gallery.\n\nInstantly the motionless figure below arose and glided noiselessly and\nswiftly up the flight of steps.\n\nTwo rude stone pillars flanked either side of the end of the gallery.\nLike a shadow the black figure slipped behind one of these, flattening\nitself up against the wall, where it stood straight and motionless as\nthe shadows around it.\n\nDown the long gallery came the watchman, his sword clinking loudly in\nthe silence as he walked, tramp, tramp, tramp! clink, clank, jingle.\n\nWithin three feet of the motionless figure behind the pillar he turned,\nand began retracing his monotonous steps. Instantly the other left the\nshadow of the post and crept rapidly and stealthily after him. One step,\ntwo steps the sentinel took; for a moment the black figure behind him\nseemed to crouch and draw together, then like a flash it leaped forward\nupon its victim.\n\nA shadowy cloth fell upon the man's face, and in an instant he was flung\nback and down with a muffled crash upon the stones. Then followed a\nfierce and silent struggle in the darkness, but strong and sturdy as the\nman was, he was no match for the almost superhuman strength of One-eyed\nHans. The cloth which he had flung over his head was tied tightly and\nsecurely. Then the man was forced upon his face and, in spite of his\nfierce struggles, his arms were bound around and around with strong fine\ncord; next his feet were bound in the same way, and the task was done.\nThen Hans stood upon his feet, and wiped the sweat from his swarthy\nforehead. \"Listen, brother,\" he whispered, and as he spoke he stooped\nand pressed something cold and hard against the neck of the other.\n\"Dost thou know the feel of this? It is a broad dagger, and if thou\ndost contrive to loose that gag from thy mouth and makest any outcry, it\nshall be sheathed in thy weasand.\"\n\nSo saying, he thrust the knife back again into its sheath, then stooping\nand picking up the other, he flung him across his shoulder like a sack,\nand running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at\nall, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a\nlittle while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of\nall his weapons, Hans sat the man up in the angle of the wall. \"So,\nbrother;\" said he, \"now we can talk with more ease than we could up\nyonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the\nyoung Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me,\nwell and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy weasand and find me one who\nknoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?\"\n\nThe other nodded dimly in the darkness.\n\n\"That is good,\" said Hans, \"then I will loose thy gag until thou hast\ntold me; only bear in mind what I said concerning my dagger.\"\n\nThereupon, he unbound his prisoner, and the fellow slowly rose to his\nfeet. He shook himself and looked all about him in a heavy, bewildered\nfashion, as though he had just awakened from a dream.\n\nHis right hand slid furtively down to his side, but the dagger-sheath\nwas empty.\n\n\"Come, brother!\" said Hans, impatiently, \"time is passing, and once lost\ncan never be found again. Show me the way to the young Baron Otto or--.\"\nAnd he whetted the shining blade of his dagger on his horny palm.\n\nThe fellow needed no further bidding; turning, he led the way, and\ntogether they were swallowed up in the yawning shadows, and again the\nhush of night-time lay upon the Castle of Trutz-Drachen.\n\n\n\n\nXI. How Otto was Saved.\n\nLittle Otto was lying upon the hard couch in his cell, tossing in\nrestless and feverish sleep; suddenly a heavy hand was laid upon him and\na voice whispered in his ear, \"Baron, Baron Otto, waken, rouse yourself;\nI am come to help you. I am One-eyed Hans.\"\n\nOtto was awake in an instant and raised himself upon his elbow in the\ndarkness. \"One-eyed Hans,\" he breathed, \"One-eyed Hans; who is One-eyed\nHans?\"\n\n\"True,\" said the other, \"thou dost not know me. I am thy father's\ntrusted servant, and am the only one excepting his own blood and kin\nwho has clung to him in this hour of trouble. Yes, all are gone but me\nalone, and so I have come to help thee away from this vile place.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, good Hans! if only thou canst!\" cried Otto; \"if only thou\ncanst take me away from this wicked place. Alas, dear Hans! I am weary\nand sick to death.\" And poor little Otto began to weep silently in the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Hans, gruffly, \"it is no place for a little child\nto be. Canst thou climb, my little master? canst thou climb a knotted\nrope?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Otto, \"I can never climb again! See, Hans;\" and he flung\nback the covers from off him.\n\n\"I cannot see,\" said Hans, \"it is too dark.\"\n\n\"Then feel, dear Hans,\" said Otto.\n\nHans bent over the poor little white figure glimmering palely in the\ndarkness. Suddenly he drew back with a snarl like an angry wolf. \"Oh!\nthe black, bloody wretches!\" he cried, hoarsely; \"and have they done\nthat to thee, a little child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Otto, \"the Baron Henry did it.\" And then again he began to\ncry.\n\n\"There, there,\" said Hans, roughly, \"weep no more. Thou shalt get away\nfrom here even if thou canst not climb; I myself will help thee. Thy\nfather is already waiting below the window here, and thou shalt soon be\nwith him. There, there, cry no more.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking Hans had stripped off his peddler's leathern\njacket, and there, around his body, was wrapped coil after coil of stout\nhempen rope tied in knots at short distances. He began unwinding the\nrope, and when he had done he was as thin as ever he had been before.\nNext he drew from the pouch that hung at his side a ball of fine cord\nand a leaden weight pierced by a hole, both of which he had brought with\nhim for the use to which he now put them. He tied the lead to the end of\nthe cord, then whirling the weight above his head, he flung it up toward\nthe window high above. Twice the piece of lead fell back again into the\nroom; the third time it flew out between the iron bars carrying the cord\nwith it. Hans held the ball in his hand and paid out the string as the\nweight carried it downward toward the ground beneath. Suddenly the cord\nstopped running. Hans jerked it and shook it, but it moved no farther.\n\"Pray heaven, little child,\" said he, \"that it hath reached the ground,\nfor if it hath not we are certainly lost.\"\n\n\"I do pray,\" said Otto, and he bowed his head.\n\nThen, as though in answer to his prayer, there came a twitch upon the\ncord.\n\n\"See,\" said Hans, \"they have heard thee up above in heaven; it was thy\nfather who did that.\" Quickly and deftly he tied the cord to the end of\nthe knotted rope; then he gave an answering jerk upon the string. The\nnext moment the rope was drawn up to the window and down the outside by\nthose below. Otto lay watching the rope as it crawled up to the window\nand out into the night like a great snake, while One-eyed Hans held the\nother end lest it should be drawn too far. At last it stopped. \"Good,\"\nmuttered Hans, as though to himself. \"The rope is long enough.\"\n\nHe waited for a few minutes and then, drawing upon the rope and finding\nthat it was held from below, he spat upon his hands and began slowly\nclimbing up to the window above. Winding his arm around the iron bars of\nthe grating that guarded it, he thrust his hand into the pouch that hung\nby his side, and drawing forth a file, fell to work cutting through all\nthat now lay between Otto and liberty.\n\nIt was slow, slow work, and it seemed to Otto as though Hans would never\nfinish his task, as lying upon his hard couch he watched that figure,\nblack against the sky, bending over its work. Now and then the file\nscreeched against the hard iron, and then Hans would cease for a moment,\nbut only to begin again as industriously as ever. Three or four times he\ntried the effects of his work, but still the iron held. At last he\nset his shoulder against it, and as Otto looked he saw the iron bend.\nSuddenly there was a sharp crack, and a piece of the grating went flying\nout into the night.\n\nHans tied the rope securely about the stump of the stout iron bar that\nyet remained, and then slid down again into the room below.\n\n\"My little lord,\" said he, \"dost thou think that if I carry thee, thou\nwilt be able and strong enough to cling to my neck?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, \"methinks I will be able to do that.\"\n\n\"Then come,\" said Hans.\n\nHe stooped as he spoke, and gently lifting Otto from his rude and rugged\nbed he drew his broad leathern belt around them both, buckling it firmly\nand securely. \"It does not hurt thee?\" said he.\n\n\"Not much,\" whispered Otto faintly.\n\nThen Hans spat upon his hands, and began slowly climbing the rope.\n\nThey reached the edge of the window and there they rested for a moment,\nand Otto renewed his hold around the neck of the faithful Hans.\n\n\"And now art thou ready?\" said Hans\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto.\n\n\"Then courage,\" said Hans, and he turned and swung his leg over the\nabyss below.\n\nThe next moment they were hanging in mid-air.\n\nOtto looked down and gave a gasp. \"The mother of heaven bless us,\" he\nwhispered, and then closed his eyes, faint and dizzy at the sight of\nthat sheer depth beneath. Hans said nothing, but shutting his teeth\nand wrapping his legs around the rope, he began slowly descending, hand\nunder hand. Down, down, down he went, until to Otto, with his eyes shut\nand his head leaning upon Hans' shoulder, it seemed as though it could\nnever end. Down, down, down. Suddenly he felt Hans draw a deep breath;\nthere was a slight jar, and Otto opened his eyes; Hans was standing upon\nthe ground.\n\nA figure wrapped in a dark cloak arose from the shadow of the wall, and\ntook Otto in its arms. It was Baron Conrad.\n\n\"My son--my little child!\" he cried, in a choked, trembling voice, and\nthat was all. And Otto pressed his cheek against his father's and began\ncrying.\n\nSuddenly the Baron gave a sharp, fierce cry. \"Dear Heaven!\" he cried;\n\"what have they done to thee?\" But poor little Otto could not answer.\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped the Baron, in a strangled voice, \"my little child! my\nlittle child!\" And therewith he broke down, and his whole body shook\nwith fierce, dry sobs; for men in those days did not seek to hide their\ngrief as they do now, but were fierce and strong in the expression of\nthat as of all else.\n\n\"Never mind, dear father,\" whispered Otto; \"it did not hurt me so very\nmuch,\" and he pressed his lips against his father's cheek.\n\nLittle Otto had but one hand.\n\n\n\n\nXII. A Ride For Life.\n\nBut not yet was Otto safe, and all danger past and gone by. Suddenly, as\nthey stood there, the harsh clangor of a bell broke the silence of\nthe starry night above their heads, and as they raised their faces and\nlooked up, they saw lights flashing from window to window. Presently\ncame the sound of a hoarse voice shouting something that, from the\ndistance, they could not understand.\n\nOne-eyed Hans smote his hand upon his thigh. Look said he, \"here is\nwhat comes of having a soft heart in one's bosom. I overcame and bound a\nwatchman up yonder, and forced him to tell me where our young Baron lay.\nIt was on my mind to run my knife into him after he had told me every\nthing, but then, bethinking how the young Baron hated the thought of\nbloodshed, I said to myself, 'No, Hans, I will spare the villain's\nlife.' See now what comes of being merciful; here, by hook or by crook,\nthe fellow has loosed himself from his bonds, and brings the whole\ncastle about our ears like a nest of wasps.\"\n\n\"We must fly,\" said the Baron; \"for nothing else in the world is\nleft me, now that all have deserted me in this black time of trouble,\nexcepting these six faithful ones.\"\n\nHis voice was bitter, bitter, as he spoke; then stooping, he raised Otto\nin his arms, and bearing him gently, began rapidly descending the rocky\nslope to the level road that ran along the edge of the hill beneath.\nClose behind him followed the rest; Hans still grimed with soot and in\nhis bare feet. A little distance from the road and under the shade of\nthe forest trees, seven horses stood waiting. The Baron mounted upon\nhis great black charger, seating little Otto upon the saddle in front of\nhim. \"Forward!\" he cried, and away they clattered and out upon the road.\nThen--\"To St. Michaelsburg,\" said Baron Conrad, in his deep voice, and\nthe horses' heads were turned to the westward, and away they galloped\nthrough the black shadows of the forest, leaving Trutz-Drachen behind\nthem.\n\nBut still the sound of the alarm bell rang through the beating of the\nhorses' hoofs, and as Hans looked over his shoulder, he saw the light\nof torches flashing hither and thither along the outer walls in front of\nthe great barbican.\n\nIn Castle Trutz-Drachen all was confusion and uproar: flashing torches\nlit up the dull gray walls; horses neighed and stamped, and men shouted\nand called to one another in the bustle of making ready. Presently Baron\nHenry came striding along the corridor clad in light armor, which he had\nhastily donned when roused from his sleep by the news that his prisoner\nhad escaped. Below in the courtyard his horse was standing, and without\nwaiting for assistance, he swung himself into the saddle. Then away they\nall rode and down the steep path, armor ringing, swords clanking, and\niron-shod hoofs striking sparks of fire from the hard stones. At their\nhead rode Baron Henry; his triangular shield hung over his shoulder, and\nin his hand he bore a long, heavy, steel-pointed lance with a pennant\nflickering darkly from the end.\n\nAt the high-road at the base of the slope they paused, for they were at\na loss to know which direction the fugitives had taken; a half a score\nof the retainers leaped from their horses, and began hurrying about\nhither and thither, and up and down, like hounds searching for the lost\nscent, and all the time Baron Henry sat still as a rock in the midst of\nthe confusion.\n\nSuddenly a shout was raised from the forest just beyond the road; they\nhad come upon the place where the horses had been tied. It was an easy\nmatter to trace the way that Baron Conrad and his followers had taken\nthence back to the high-road, but there again they were at a loss. The\nroad ran straight as an arrow eastward and westward--had the fugitives\ntaken their way to the east or to the west?\n\nBaron Henry called his head-man, Nicholas Stein, to him, and the\ntwo spoke together for a while in an undertone. At last the Baron's\nlieutenant reined his horse back, and choosing first one and then\nanother, divided the company into two parties. The baron placed himself\nat the head of one band and Nicholas Stein at the head of the other.\n\"Forward!\" he cried, and away clattered the two companies of horsemen in\nopposite directions.\n\nIt was toward the westward that Baron Henry of Trutz-Drachen rode at the\nhead of his men.\n\nThe early springtide sun shot its rays of misty, yellow light across the\nrolling tops of the forest trees where the little birds were singing in\nthe glory of the May morning. But Baron Henry and his followers thought\nnothing of the beauty of the peaceful day, and heard nothing of the\nmultitudinous sound of the singing birds as, with a confused sound of\ngalloping hoofs, they swept along the highway, leaving behind them a\nslow-curling, low-trailing cloud of dust.\n\nAs the sun rose more full and warm, the misty wreaths began to dissolve,\nuntil at last they parted and rolled asunder like a white curtain and\nthere, before the pursuing horsemen, lay the crest of the mountain\ntoward which they were riding, and up which the road wound steeply.\n\n\"Yonder they are,\" cried a sudden voice behind Baron Henry of\nTrutz-Drachen, and at the cry all looked upward.\n\nFar away upon the mountain-side curled a cloud of dust, from the midst\nof which came the star-like flash of burnished armor gleaming in the\nsun.\n\nBaron Henry said never a word, but his lips curled in a grim smile.\n\nAnd as the mist wreaths parted One-eyed Hans looked behind and down\ninto the leafy valley beneath. \"Yonder they come,\" said he. \"They have\nfollowed sharply to gain so much upon us, even though our horses are\nwearied with all the travelling we have done hither and yon these five\ndays past. How far is it, Lord Baron, from here to Michaelsburg?\"\n\n\"About ten leagues,\" said the Baron, in a gloomy voice.\n\nHans puckered his mouth as though to whistle, but the Baron saw nothing\nof it, for he was gazing straight before him with a set and stony face.\nThose who followed him looked at one another, and the same thought was\nin the mind of each--how long would it be before those who pursued would\nclose the distance between them?\n\nWhen that happened it meant death to one and all.\n\nThey reached the crest of the hill, and down they dashed upon the other\nside; for there the road was smooth and level as it sloped away into the\nvalley, but it was in dead silence that they rode. Now and then those\nwho followed the Baron looked back over their shoulders. They had gained\na mile upon their pursuers when the helmeted heads rose above the crest\nof the mountain, but what was the gain of a mile with a smooth road\nbetween them, and fresh horses to weary ones?\n\nOn they rode and on they rode. The sun rose higher and higher, and\nhotter and hotter. There was no time to rest and water their panting\nhorses. Only once, when they crossed a shallow stretch of water, the\npoor animals bent their heads and caught a few gulps from the cool\nstream, and the One-eyed Hans washed a part of the soot from his hands\nand face. On and on they rode; never once did the Baron Conrad move his\nhead or alter that steadfast look as, gazing straight before him, he\nrode steadily forward along the endless stretch of road, with poor\nlittle Otto's yellow head and white face resting against his steel-clad\nshoulder--and St. Michaelsburg still eight leagues away.\n\nA little rise of ground lay before them, and as they climbed it, all,\nexcepting the baron, turned their heads as with one accord and looked\nbehind them. Then more than one heart failed, for through the leaves\nof the trees below, they caught the glint of armor of those who\nfollowed--not more than a mile away. The next moment they swept over the\ncrest, and there, below them, lay the broad shining river, and nearer a\ntributary stream spanned by a rude, narrow, three-arched, stone bridge\nwhere the road crossed the deep, slow-moving water.\n\nDown the slope plodded the weary horses, and so to the bridge-head.\n\n\"Halt,\" cried the baron suddenly, and drew rein.\n\nThe others stood bewildered. What did he mean to do? He turned to Hans\nand his blue eyes shone like steel.\n\n\"Hans,\" said he, in his deep voice, \"thou hast served me long and truly;\nwilt thou for this one last time do my bidding?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Hans, briefly.\n\n\"Swear it,\" said the Baron.\n\n\"I swear it,\" said Hans, and he drew the sign of the cross upon his\nheart.\n\n\"That is good,\" said the Baron, grimly. \"Then take thou this child,\nand with the others ride with all the speed that thou canst to St.\nMichaelsburg. Give the child into the charge of the Abbot Otto. Tell\nhim how that I have sworn fealty to the Emperor, and what I have gained\nthereby--my castle burnt, my people slain, and this poor, simple child,\nmy only son, mutilated by my enemy.\n\n\"And thou, my Lord Baron?\" said Hans.\n\n\"I will stay here,\" said the Baron, quietly, \"and keep back those who\nfollow as long as God will give me grace so to do.\"\n\nA murmur of remonstrance rose among the faithful few who were with\nhim, two of whom were near of kin. But Conrad of Drachenhausen turned\nfiercely upon them.\n\n\"How now,\" said he, \"have I fallen so low in my troubles that even ye\ndare to raise your voices against me? By the good Heaven, I will begin\nmy work here by slaying the first man who dares to raise word against\nmy bidding.\" Then he turned from them. \"Here, Hans,\" said he, \"take the\nboy; and remember, knave, what thou hast sworn.\"\n\nHe pressed Otto close to his breast in one last embrace. \"My little\nchild,\" he murmured, \"try not to hate thy father when thou thinkest of\nhim hereafter, even though he be hard and bloody as thou knowest.\"\n\nBut with his suffering and weakness, little Otto knew nothing of what\nwas passing; it was only as in a faint flickering dream that he lived in\nwhat was done around him.\n\n\"Farewell, Otto,\" said the Baron, but Otto's lips only moved faintly in\nanswer. His father kissed him upon either cheek. \"Come, Hans,\" said\nhe, hastily, \"take him hence;\" and he loosed Otto's arms from about his\nneck.\n\nHans took Otto upon the saddle in front of him.\n\n\"Oh! my dear Lord Baron,\" said he, and then stopped with a gulp, and\nturned his grotesquely twitching face aside.\n\n\"Go,\" said the Baron, harshly, \"there is no time to lose in woman's\ntears.\"\n\n\"Farewell, Conrad! farewell, Conrad!\" said his two kinsmen, and coming\nforward they kissed him upon the cheek then they turned and rode away\nafter Hans, and Baron Conrad was left alone to face his mortal foe.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. How Baron Conrad Held the Bridge.\n\nAs the last of his followers swept around the curving road and was lost\nto sight, Baron Conrad gave himself a shake, as though to drive away the\nthoughts that lay upon him. Then he rode slowly forward to the middle of\nthe bridge, where he wheeled his horse so as to face his coming enemies.\nHe lowered the vizor of his helmet and bolted it to its place, and then\nsaw that sword and dagger were loose in the scabbard and easy to draw\nwhen the need for drawing should arise.\n\n\nDown the steep path from the hill above swept the pursuing horsemen.\nDown the steep path to the bridge-head and there drew rein; for in the\nmiddle of the narrow way sat the motionless, steel-clad figure upon the\ngreat war-horse, with wide, red, panting nostrils, and body streaked\nwith sweat and flecked with patches of foam.\n\nOne side of the roadway of the bridge was guarded by a low stone wall;\nthe other side was naked and open and bare to the deep, slow-moving\nwater beneath. It was a dangerous place to attack a desperate man clad\nin armor of proof.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried Baron Henry, but not a soul stirred in answer, and\nstill the iron-clad figure sat motionless and erect upon the panting\nhorse.\n\n\"How,\" cried the Baron Henry, \"are ye afraid of one man? Then follow\nme!\" and he spurred forward to the bridge-head. But still no one moved\nin answer, and the Lord of Trutz-Drachen reined back his horse again.\nHe wheeled his horse and glared round upon the stolid faces of his\nfollowers, until his eyes seemed fairly to blaze with passion beneath\nthe bars of his vizor.\n\nBaron Conrad gave a roar of laughter. \"How now,\" he cried; \"are ye all\nafraid of one man? Is there none among ye that dares come forward and\nmeet me? I know thee, Baron Henry thou art not afraid to cut off the\nhand of a little child. Hast thou not now the courage to face the\nfather?\"\n\nBaron Henry gnashed his teeth with rage as he glared around upon the\nfaces of his men-at-arms. Suddenly his eye lit upon one of them. \"Ha!\nCarl Spigler,\" he cried, \"thou hast thy cross-bow with thee;--shoot me\ndown yonder dog! Nay,\" he said, \"thou canst do him no harm under his\narmor; shoot the horse upon which he sits.\"\n\nBaron Conrad heard the speech. \"Oh! thou coward villain!\" he cried,\n\"stay; do not shoot the good horse. I will dismount and fight ye upon\nfoot.\" Thereupon, armed as he was, he leaped clashing from his horse and\nturning the animal's head, gave it a slap upon the flank. The good horse\nfirst trotted and then walked to the further end of the bridge, where it\nstopped and began cropping at the grass that grew beside the road.\n\n\"Now then!\" cried Baron Henry, fiercely, \"now then, ye cannot fear him,\nvillains! Down with him! forward!\"\n\nSlowly the troopers spurred their horses forward upon the bridge and\ntoward that one figure that, grasping tightly the great two-handed\nsword, stood there alone guarding the passage.\n\nThen Baron Conrad whirled the great blade above his head, until it\ncaught the sunlight and flashed again. He did not wait for the attack,\nbut when the first of the advancing horsemen had come within a few feet\nof him, he leaped with a shout upon them. The fellow thrust at him with\nhis lance, and the Baron went staggering a few feet back, but instantly\nhe recovered himself and again leaped forward. The great sword flashed\nin the air, whistling; it fell, and the nearest man dropped his lance,\nclattering, and with a loud, inarticulate cry, grasped the mane of his\nhorse with both hands. Again the blade whistled in the air, and this\ntime it was stained with red. Again it fell, and with another shrill cry\nthe man toppled headlong beneath the horse's feet. The next instant they\nwere upon him, each striving to strike at the one figure, to ride him\ndown, or to thrust him down with their lances. There was no room now to\nswing the long blade, but holding the hilt in both hands, Baron Conrad\nthrust with it as though it were a lance, stabbing at horse or man, it\nmattered not. Crowded upon the narrow roadway of the bridge, those who\nattacked had not only to guard themselves against the dreadful strokes\nof that terrible sword, but to keep their wounded horses (rearing and\nmad with fright) from toppling bodily over with them into the water\nbeneath.\n\nPresently the cry was raised, \"Back! back!\" And those nearest the Baron\nbegan reining in their horses. \"Forward!\" roared Baron Henry, from the\nmidst of the crowd; but in spite of his command, and even the blows that\nhe gave, those behind were borne back by those in front, struggling and\nshouting, and the bridge was cleared again excepting for three figures\nthat lay motionless upon the roadway, and that one who, with the\nbrightness of his armor dimmed and stained, leaned panting against the\nwall of the bridge.\n\nThe Baron Henry raged like a madman. Gnashing his teeth together, he\nrode back a little way; then turning and couching his lance, he suddenly\nclapped spurs to his horse, and the next instant came thundering down\nupon his solitary enemy.\n\nBaron Conrad whirled his sword in the air, as he saw the other coming\nlike a thunderbolt upon him; he leaped aside, and the lance passed close\nto him. As it passed he struck, and the iron point flew from the shaft\nof the spear at the blow, and fell clattering upon the stone roadway of\nthe bridge.\n\nBaron Henry drew in his horse until it rested upon its haunches, then\nslowly reined it backward down the bridge, still facing his foe,\nand still holding the wooden stump of the lance in his hand. At the\nbridge-head he flung it from him.\n\n\"Another lance!\" he cried, hoarsely. One was silently reached to him\nand he took it, his hand trembling with rage. Again he rode to a little\ndistance and wheeled his horse; then, driving his steel spurs into its\nquivering side, he came again thundering down upon the other. Once more\nthe terrible sword whirled in the air and fell, but this time the lance\nwas snatched to one side and the blow fell harmlessly. The next instant,\nand with a twitch of the bridle-rein, the horse struck full and fair\nagainst the man.\n\nConrad of Drachenhausen was whirled backward and downward, and the cruel\niron hoofs crashed over his prostrate body, as horse and man passed with\na rush beyond him and to the bridge-head beyond. A shout went up from\nthose who stood watching. The next moment the prostrate figure rose and\nstaggered blindly to the side of the bridge, and stood leaning against\nthe stone wall.\n\nAt the further end of the bridge Baron Henry had wheeled his horse. Once\nagain he couched lance, and again he drove down upon his bruised and\nwounded enemy. This time the lance struck full and fair, and those who\nwatched saw the steel point pierce the iron breast-plate and then snap\nshort, leaving the barbed point within the wound.\n\nBaron Conrad sunk to his knees and the Roderburg, looming upon his horse\nabove him, unsheathed his sword to finish the work he had begun.\n\nThen those who stood looking on saw a wondrous thing happen: the wounded\nman rose suddenly to his feet, and before his enemy could strike he\nleaped, with a great and bitter cry of agony and despair, upon him as he\nsat in the saddle above.\n\nHenry of Trutz-Drachen grasped at his horse's mane, but the attack\nwas so fierce, so sudden, and so unexpected that before he could save\nhimself he was dragged to one side and fell crashing in his armor upon\nthe stone roadway of the bridge.\n\n\"The dragon! the dragon!\" roared Baron Conrad, in a voice of thunder,\nand with the energy of despair he dragged his prostrate foe toward the\nopen side of the bridge.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried the chief of the Trutz-Drachen men, and down they rode\nupon the struggling knights to the rescue of their master in this new\ndanger. But they were too late.\n\nThere was a pause at the edge of the bridge, for Baron Henry had gained\nhis feet and, stunned and bewildered as he was by the suddenness of his\nfall, he was now struggling fiercely, desperately. For a moment they\nstood swaying backward and forward, clasped in one another's arms, the\nblood from the wounded man's breast staining the armor of both. The\nmoment passed and then, with a shower of stones and mortar from beneath\ntheir iron-shod heels, they toppled and fell; there was a thunderous\nsplash in the water below, and as the men-at-arms came hurrying up and\npeered with awe-struck faces over the parapet of the bridge, they saw\nthe whirling eddies sweep down with the current of the stream, a few\nbubbles rise to the surface of the water, and then--nothing; for the\nsmooth river flowed onward as silently as ever.\n\nPresently a loud voice burst through the awed hush that followed. It\ncame from William of Roderburg, Baron Henry's kinsman.\n\n\"Forward!\" he cried. A murmur of voices from the others was all the\nanswer that he received. \"Forward!\" cried the young man again, \"the boy\nand those with him are not so far away but that we might yet catch up\nwith them.\"\n\nThen one of the men spoke up in answer--a man with a seamed,\nweather-beaten face and crisp grizzled hair. \"Nay,\" said he, \"our Lord\nBaron is gone, and this is no quarrel of ours; here be four of us that\nare wounded and three I misdoubt that are dead; why should we follow\nfurther only to suffer more blows for no gain?\" A growl of assent rose\nfrom those that stood around, and William of Roderburg saw that nothing\nmore was to be done by the Trutz-Dragons that day.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. How Otto Saw the Great Emperor.\n\nThrough weakness and sickness and faintness, Otto had lain in a half\nswoon through all that long journey under the hot May sun. It was as in\na dreadful nightmare that he had heard on and on and on that monotonous\nthrobbing of galloping hoofs upon the ground; had felt that last kiss\nthat his father had given him upon his cheek. Then the onward ride\nagain, until all faded away into a dull mist and he knew no more. When\nnext he woke it was with the pungent smell of burned vinegar in his\nnostrils and with the feeling of a cool napkin bathing his brow. He\nopened his eyes and then closed them again, thinking he must have been\nin a dream, for he lay in his old room at the peaceful monastery of the\nWhite Cross on the hill; the good Father Abbot sat near by, gazing upon\nhis face with the old absent student look, Brother John sat in the deep\nwindow seat also gazing at him, and Brother Theodore, the leech of the\nmonastery, sat beside him bathing his head. Beside these old familiar\nfaces were the faces of those who had been with him in that long flight;\nthe One-eyed Hans, old Master Nicholas his kinsman, and the others.\nSo he closed his eyes, thinking that maybe it was all a dream. But the\nsharp throbbing of the poor stump at his wrist soon taught him that he\nwas still awake.\n\n\"Am I then really home in St. Michaelsburg again?\" he murmured, without\nunclosing his eyes.\n\nBrother Theodore began snuffling through his nose; there was a pause.\n\"Yes,\" said the old Abbot at last, and his gentle voice trembled as\nhe spoke; \"yes, my dear little child, thou art back again in thine own\nhome; thou hast not been long out in the great world, but truly thou\nhast had a sharp and bitter trial of it.\"\n\n\"But they will not take me away again, will they?\" said Otto quickly,\nunclosing his blue eyes.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Abbot, gently; \"not until thou art healed in body and\nart ready and willing to go.\"\n\nThree months and more had passed, and Otto was well again; and now,\nescorted by One-eyed Hans and those faithful few who had clung to the\nBaron Conrad through his last few bitter days, he was riding into the\nquaint old town of Nurnburg; for the Emperor Rudolph was there at that\ntime, waiting for King Ottocar of Bohemia to come thither and answer\nthe imperial summons before the Council, and Otto was travelling to the\ncourt.\n\nAs they rode in through the gates of the town, Otto looked up at the\nhigh-peaked houses with their overhanging gables, the like of which he\nhad never seen before, and he stared with his round blue eyes at seeing\nthem so crowded together along the length of the street. But most of\nall he wondered at the number of people that passed hither and thither,\njostling each other in their hurry, and at the tradesmen's booths\nopening upon the street with the wonderful wares hanging within; armor\nat the smiths, glittering ornaments at the goldsmiths, and rich fabrics\nof silks and satins at the mercers. He had never seen anything so rich\nand grand in all of his life, for little Otto had never been in a town\nbefore.\n\n\"Oh! look,\" he cried, \"at that wonderful lady; see, holy father! sure\nthe Emperor's wife can be no finer than that lady.\"\n\nThe Abbot smiled. \"Nay, Otto,\" said he, \"that is but a burgher's wife or\ndaughter; the ladies at the Emperor's court are far grander than such as\nshe.\"\n\n\"So!\" said Otto, and then fell silent with wonder.\n\nAnd now, at last the great moment had come when little Otto with his own\neyes was to behold the mighty Emperor who ruled over all the powerful\nkingdoms of Germany and Austria, and Italy and Bohemia, and other\nkingdoms and principalities and states. His heart beat so that he could\nhardly speak as, for a moment, the good Abbot who held him by the hand\nstopped outside of the arrased doorway to whisper some last instructions\ninto his ear. Then they entered the apartment.\n\nIt was a long, stone-paved room. The floor was covered with rich rugs\nand the walls were hung with woven tapestry wherein were depicted\nknights and ladies in leafy gardens and kings and warriors at battle.\nA long row of high glazed windows extended along the length of the\napartment, flooding it with the mellow light of the autumn day. At\nthe further end of the room, far away, and standing by a great carved\nchimney place wherein smouldered the remains of a fire, stood a group of\nnobles in gorgeous dress of velvet and silks, and with glittering golden\nchains hung about their necks.\n\nOne figure stood alone in front of the great yawning fireplace. His\nhands were clasped behind him, and his look bent thoughtfully upon the\nfloor. He was dressed only in a simple gray robe without ornament or\nadornment, a plain leathern belt girded his waist, and from it hung a\nsword with a bone hilt encased in a brown leathern scabbard. A noble\nstag-hound lay close behind him, curled up upon the floor, basking in\nthe grateful warmth of the fire.\n\nAs the Father Abbot and Otto drew near he raised his head and looked\nat them. It was a plain, homely face that Otto saw, with a wrinkled\nforehead and a long mouth drawn down at the corners. It was the face of\na good, honest burgher burdened with the cares of a prosperous trade.\n\"Who can he be,\" thought Otto, \"and why does the poor man stand there\namong all the great nobles?\"\n\nBut the Abbot walked straight up to him and kneeled upon the floor,\nand little Otto, full of wonder, did the same. It was the great Emperor\nRudolph.\n\n\"Who have we here,\" said the Emperor, and he bent his brow upon the\nAbbot and the boy.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Abbot Otto, \"we have humbly besought you by petition, in\nthe name of your late vassal, Baron Conrad of Vuelph of Drachenhausen,\nfor justice to this his son, the Baron Otto, whom, sire, as you may see,\nhath been cruelly mutilated at the hands of Baron Henry of Roderburg of\nTrutz-Drachen. He hath moreover been despoiled of his lands, his castle\nburnt, and his household made prisoner.\"\n\nThe Emperor frowned until the shaggy eyebrows nearly hid the keen gray\ntwinkle of the eyes beneath. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I do remember me of\nthat petition, and have given it consideration both in private and in\ncouncil.\" He turned to the group of listening nobles. \"Look,\" said he,\n\"at this little child marred by the inhumanity and the cruelty of those\nrobber villains. By heavens! I will put down their lawless rapine, if I\nhave to give every castle from the north to the south to the flames and\nto the sword.\" Then turning to Otto again, \"Poor little child,\" said he,\n\"thy wrongs shall be righted, and so far as they are able, those cruel\nRoderburgs shall pay thee penny for penny, and grain for grain, for what\nthou hast lost; and until such indemnity hath been paid the family of\nthe man who wrought this deed shall be held as surety.\"\n\nLittle Otto looked up in the kind, rugged face above him. \"Nay, Lord\nEmperor,\" said he, in his quaint, quiet way, \"there are but two in the\nfamily--the mother and the daughter--and I have promised to marry the\nlittle girl when she and I are old enough; so, if you please, I would\nnot have harm happen to her.\"\n\nThe Emperor continued to look down at the kneeling boy, and at last he\ngave a short, dry laugh. \"So be it,\" said he, \"thy plan is not without\nits wisdom. Mayhap it is all for the best that the affair should be\nended thus peacefully. The estates of the Roderburgs shall be held in\ntrust for thee until thou art come of age; otherwise it shall be as thou\nhast proposed, the little maiden shall be taken into ward under our own\ncare. And as to thee--art thou willing that I should take thee under my\nown charge in the room of thy father, who is dead?\"\n\n\"Aye,\" said Otto, simply, \"I am willing, for it seems to me that thou\nart a good man.\"\n\nThe nobles who stood near smiled at the boy's speech. As for the\nEmperor, he laughed outright. \"I give thee thanks, my Lord Baron,\" said\nhe; \"there is no one in all my court who has paid me greater courtesy\nthan that.\"\n\nSo comes the end of our tale.\n\nBut perhaps you may like to know what happened afterward, for no one\ncares to leave the thread of a story without tying a knot in it.\n\nEight years had passed, and Otto grew up to manhood in the Emperor's\ncourt, and was with him through war and peace.\n\nBut he himself never drew sword or struck a blow, for the right hand\nthat hung at his side was of pure silver, and the hard, cold fingers\nnever closed. Folks called him \"Otto of the Silver Hand,\" but perhaps\nthere was another reason than that for the name that had been given him,\nfor the pure, simple wisdom that the old monks of the White Cross on\nthe hill had taught him, clung to him through all the honors that the\nEmperor bestowed upon his favorite, and as he grew older his words were\nlistened to and weighed by those who were high in Council, and even by\nthe Emperor himself.\n\nAnd now for the end of all.\n\nOne day Otto stood uncertainly at the doorway of a room in the imperial\ncastle, hesitating before he entered; and yet there was nothing so very\ndreadful within, only one poor girl whose heart fluttered more than his.\nPoor little Pauline, whom he had not seen since that last day in the\nblack cell at Trutz-Drachen.\n\nAt last he pushed aside the hangings and entered the room.\n\nShe was sitting upon a rude bench beside the window, looking at him out\nof her great, dark eyes.\n\nHe stopped short and stood for a moment confused and silent; for he had\nno thought in his mind but of the little girl whom he had last seen, and\nfor a moment he stood confused before the fair maiden with her great,\nbeautiful dark eyes.\n\nShe on her part beheld a tall, slender youth with curling, golden hair,\none hand white and delicate, the other of pure and shining silver.\n\nHe came to her and took her hand and set it to his lips, and all that\nshe could do was to gaze with her great, dark eyes upon the hero of whom\nshe had heard so many talk; the favorite of the Emperor; the wise young\nOtto of the Silver Hand.\n\n\n\n\nAfterword\n\nThe ruins of Drachenhausen were rebuilt, for the walls were as sound as\never, though empty and gaping to the sky; but it was no longer the den\nof a robber baron for beneath the scutcheon over the great gate was\ncarved a new motto of the Vuelphs; a motto which the Emperor Rudolph\nhimself had given:\n\n\"Manus argentea quam manus ferrea melior est.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Otto of the Silver Hand, by Howard Pyle", "answers": ["Otto was so young."], "length": 27745, "dataset": "narrativeqa", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "36232c9c63d19d282643657b3da5b688cb14e3b44009c494"}

HTML version by Al Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Devil's Foot\n\n\nBy\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nIn recording from time to time some of the curious experiences and\ninteresting recollections which I associate with my long and intimate\nfriendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I have continually been faced by\ndifficulties caused by his own aversion to publicity.  To his sombre\nand cynical spirit all popular applause was always abhorrent, and\nnothing amused him more at the end of a successful case than to hand\nover the actual exposure to some orthodox official, and to listen with\na mocking smile to the general chorus of misplaced congratulation.  It\nwas indeed this attitude upon the part of my friend and certainly not\nany lack of interesting material which has caused me of late years to\nlay very few of my records before the public.  My participation in some\nof his adventures was always a privilege which entailed discretion and\nreticence upon me.\n\nIt was, then, with considerable surprise that I received a telegram\nfrom Holmes last Tuesday--he has never been known to write where a\ntelegram would serve--in the following terms:\n\nWhy not tell them of the Cornish horror--strangest case I have handled.\n\nI have no idea what backward sweep of memory had brought the matter\nfresh to his mind, or what freak had caused him to desire that I should\nrecount it; but I hasten, before another cancelling telegram may\narrive, to hunt out the notes which give me the exact details of the\ncase and to lay the narrative before my readers.\n\nIt was, then, in the spring of the year 1897 that Holmes's iron\nconstitution showed some symptoms of giving way in the face of constant\nhard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional\nindiscretions of his own.  In March of that year Dr. Moore Agar, of\nHarley Street, whose dramatic introduction to Holmes I may some day\nrecount, gave positive injunctions that the famous private agent lay\naside all his cases and surrender himself to complete rest if he wished\nto avert an absolute breakdown.  The state of his health was not a\nmatter in which he himself took the faintest interest, for his mental\ndetachment was absolute, but he was induced at last, on the threat of\nbeing permanently disqualified from work, to give himself a complete\nchange of scene and air.  Thus it was that in the early spring of that\nyear we found ourselves together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay, at\nthe further extremity of the Cornish peninsula.\n\nIt was a singular spot, and one peculiarly well suited to the grim\nhumour of my patient.  From the windows of our little whitewashed\nhouse, which stood high upon a grassy headland, we looked down upon the\nwhole sinister semicircle of Mounts Bay, that old death trap of sailing\nvessels, with its fringe of black cliffs and surge-swept reefs on which\ninnumerable seamen have met their end.  With a northerly breeze it lies\nplacid and sheltered, inviting the storm-tossed craft to tack into it\nfor rest and protection.\n\nThen come the sudden swirl round of the wind, the blistering gale from\nthe south-west, the dragging anchor, the lee shore, and the last battle\nin the creaming breakers.  The wise mariner stands far out from that\nevil place.\n\nOn the land side our surroundings were as sombre as on the sea. It was\na country of rolling moors, lonely and dun-colored, with an occasional\nchurch tower to mark the site of some old-world village.  In every\ndirection upon these moors there were traces of some vanished race\nwhich had passed utterly away, and left as its sole record strange\nmonuments of stone, irregular mounds which contained the burned ashes\nof the dead, and curious earthworks which hinted at prehistoric strife.\nThe glamour and mystery of the place, with its sinister atmosphere of\nforgotten nations, appealed to the imagination of my friend, and he\nspent much of his time in long walks and solitary meditations upon the\nmoor. The ancient Cornish language had also arrested his attention, and\nhe had, I remember, conceived the idea that it was akin to the\nChaldean, and had been largely derived from the Phoenician traders in\ntin.  He had received a consignment of books upon philology and was\nsettling down to develop this thesis when suddenly, to my sorrow and to\nhis unfeigned delight, we found ourselves, even in that land of dreams,\nplunged into a problem at our very doors which was more intense, more\nengrossing, and infinitely more mysterious than any of those which had\ndriven us from London.  Our simple life and peaceful, healthy routine\nwere violently interrupted, and we were precipitated into the midst of\na series of events which caused the utmost excitement not only in\nCornwall but throughout the whole west of England. Many of my readers\nmay retain some recollection of what was called at the time \"The\nCornish Horror,\" though a most imperfect account of the matter reached\nthe London press. Now, after thirteen years, I will give the true\ndetails of this inconceivable affair to the public.\n\nI have said that scattered towers marked the villages which dotted this\npart of Cornwall.  The nearest of these was the hamlet of Tredannick\nWollas, where the cottages of a couple of hundred inhabitants clustered\nround an ancient, moss-grown church.  The vicar of the parish, Mr.\nRoundhay, was something of an archaeologist, and as such Holmes had\nmade his acquaintance. He was a middle-aged man, portly and affable,\nwith a considerable fund of local lore.  At his invitation we had taken\ntea at the vicarage and had come to know, also, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis,\nan independent gentleman, who increased the clergyman's scanty\nresources by taking rooms in his large, straggling house.  The vicar,\nbeing a bachelor, was glad to come to such an arrangement, though he\nhad little in common with his lodger, who was a thin, dark, spectacled\nman, with a stoop which gave the impression of actual, physical\ndeformity.  I remember that during our short visit we found the vicar\ngarrulous, but his lodger strangely reticent, a sad-faced,\nintrospective man, sitting with averted eyes, brooding apparently upon\nhis own affairs.\n\nThese were the two men who entered abruptly into our little\nsitting-room on Tuesday, March the 16th, shortly after our breakfast\nhour, as we were smoking together, preparatory to our daily excursion\nupon the moors.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" said the vicar in an agitated voice, \"the most\nextraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night. It is\nthe most unheard-of business.  We can only regard it as a special\nProvidence that you should chance to be here at the time, for in all\nEngland you are the one man we need.\"\n\nI glared at the intrusive vicar with no very friendly eyes; but Holmes\ntook his pipe from his lips and sat up in his chair like an old hound\nwho hears the view-halloa.  He waved his hand to the sofa, and our\npalpitating visitor with his agitated companion sat side by side upon\nit.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis was more self-contained than the clergyman,\nbut the twitching of his thin hands and the brightness of his dark eyes\nshowed that they shared a common emotion.\n\n\"Shall I speak or you?\" he asked of the vicar.\n\n\"Well, as you seem to have made the discovery, whatever it may be, and\nthe vicar to have had it second-hand, perhaps you had better do the\nspeaking,\" said Holmes.\n\nI glanced at the hastily clad clergyman, with the formally dressed\nlodger seated beside him, and was amused at the surprise which Holmes's\nsimple deduction had brought to their faces.\n\n\"Perhaps I had best say a few words first,\" said the vicar, \"and then\nyou can judge if you will listen to the details from Mr. Tregennis, or\nwhether we should not hasten at once to the scene of this mysterious\naffair.  I may explain, then, that our friend here spent last evening\nin the company of his two brothers, Owen and George, and of his sister\nBrenda, at their house of Tredannick Wartha, which is near the old\nstone cross upon the moor.  He left them shortly after ten o'clock,\nplaying cards round the dining-room table, in excellent health and\nspirits. This morning, being an early riser, he walked in that\ndirection before breakfast and was overtaken by the carriage of Dr.\nRichards, who explained that he had just been sent for on a most urgent\ncall to Tredannick Wartha.  Mr. Mortimer Tregennis naturally went with\nhim.  When he arrived at Tredannick Wartha he found an extraordinary\nstate of things.  His two brothers and his sister were seated round the\ntable exactly as he had left them, the cards still spread in front of\nthem and the candles burned down to their sockets.  The sister lay back\nstone-dead in her chair, while the two brothers sat on each side of her\nlaughing, shouting, and singing, the senses stricken clean out of them.\nAll three of them, the dead woman and the two demented men, retained\nupon their faces an expression of the utmost horror--a convulsion of\nterror which was dreadful to look upon.  There was no sign of the\npresence of anyone in the house, except Mrs. Porter, the old cook and\nhousekeeper, who declared that she had slept deeply and heard no sound\nduring the night.  Nothing had been stolen or disarranged, and there is\nabsolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has\nfrightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses.\nThere is the situation, Mr. Holmes, in a nutshell, and if you can help\nus to clear it up you will have done a great work.\"\n\nI had hoped that in some way I could coax my companion back into the\nquiet which had been the object of our journey; but one glance at his\nintense face and contracted eyebrows told me how vain was now the\nexpectation.  He sat for some little time in silence, absorbed in the\nstrange drama which had broken in upon our peace.\n\n\"I will look into this matter,\" he said at last.  \"On the face of it,\nit would appear to be a case of a very exceptional nature. Have you\nbeen there yourself, Mr. Roundhay?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes.  Mr. Tregennis brought back the account to the\nvicarage, and I at once hurried over with him to consult you.\"\n\n\"How far is it to the house where this singular tragedy occurred?\"\n\n\"About a mile inland.\"\n\n\"Then we shall walk over together.  But before we start I must ask you\na few questions, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis.\"\n\nThe other had been silent all this time, but I had observed that his\nmore controlled excitement was even greater than the obtrusive emotion\nof the clergyman.  He sat with a pale, drawn face, his anxious gaze\nfixed upon Holmes, and his thin hands clasped convulsively together.\nHis pale lips quivered as he listened to the dreadful experience which\nhad befallen his family, and his dark eyes seemed to reflect something\nof the horror of the scene.\n\n\"Ask what you like, Mr. Holmes,\" said he eagerly.  \"It is a bad thing\nto speak of, but I will answer you the truth.\"\n\n\"Tell me about last night.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I supped there, as the vicar has said, and my elder\nbrother George proposed a game of whist afterwards.  We sat down about\nnine o'clock.  It was a quarter-past ten when I moved to go.  I left\nthem all round the table, as merry as could be.\"\n\n\"Who let you out?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Porter had gone to bed, so I let myself out.  I shut the hall\ndoor behind me.  The window of the room in which they sat was closed,\nbut the blind was not drawn down.  There was no change in door or\nwindow this morning, or any reason to think that any stranger had been\nto the house.  Yet there they sat, driven clean mad with terror, and\nBrenda lying dead of fright, with her head hanging over the arm of the\nchair.  I'll never get the sight of that room out of my mind so long as\nI live.\"\n\n\"The facts, as you state them, are certainly most remarkable,\" said\nHolmes.  \"I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any\nway account for them?\"\n\n\"It's devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis. \"It is\nnot of this world.  Something has come into that room which has dashed\nthe light of reason from their minds.  What human contrivance could do\nthat?\"\n\n\"I fear,\" said Holmes, \"that if the matter is beyond humanity it is\ncertainly beyond me.  Yet we must exhaust all natural explanations\nbefore we fall back upon such a theory as this.  As to yourself, Mr.\nTregennis, I take it you were divided in some way from your family,\nsince they lived together and you had rooms apart?\"\n\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes, though the matter is past and done with. We\nwere a family of tin-miners at Redruth, but we sold our venture to a\ncompany, and so retired with enough to keep us.  I won't deny that\nthere was some feeling about the division of the money and it stood\nbetween us for a time, but it was all forgiven and forgotten, and we\nwere the best of friends together.\"\n\n\"Looking back at the evening which you spent together, does anything\nstand out in your memory as throwing any possible light upon the\ntragedy?  Think carefully, Mr. Tregennis, for any clue which can help\nme.\"\n\n\"There is nothing at all, sir.\"\n\n\"Your people were in their usual spirits?\"\n\n\"Never better.\"\n\n\"Were they nervous people?  Did they ever show any apprehension of\ncoming danger?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"You have nothing to add then, which could assist me?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis considered earnestly for a moment.\n\n\"There is one thing occurs to me,\" said he at last.  \"As we sat at the\ntable my back was to the window, and my brother George, he being my\npartner at cards, was facing it.  I saw him once look hard over my\nshoulder, so I turned round and looked also.  The blind was up and the\nwindow shut, but I could just make out the bushes on the lawn, and it\nseemed to me for a moment that I saw something moving among them.  I\ncouldn't even say if it was man or animal, but I just thought there was\nsomething there.  When I asked him what he was looking at, he told me\nthat he had the same feeling.  That is all that I can say.\"\n\n\"Did you not investigate?\"\n\n\"No; the matter passed as unimportant.\"\n\n\"You left them, then, without any premonition of evil?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"I am not clear how you came to hear the news so early this morning.\"\n\n\"I am an early riser and generally take a walk before breakfast. This\nmorning I had hardly started when the doctor in his carriage overtook\nme.  He told me that old Mrs. Porter had sent a boy down with an urgent\nmessage.  I sprang in beside him and we drove on. When we got there we\nlooked into that dreadful room.  The candles and the fire must have\nburned out hours before, and they had been sitting there in the dark\nuntil dawn had broken.  The doctor said Brenda must have been dead at\nleast six hours.  There were no signs of violence.  She just lay across\nthe arm of the chair with that look on her face.  George and Owen were\nsinging snatches of songs and gibbering like two great apes.  Oh, it\nwas awful to see!  I couldn't stand it, and the doctor was as white as\na sheet.  Indeed, he fell into a chair in a sort of faint, and we\nnearly had him on our hands as well.\"\n\n\"Remarkable--most remarkable!\" said Holmes, rising and taking his hat.\n\"I think, perhaps, we had better go down to Tredannick Wartha without\nfurther delay.  I confess that I have seldom known a case which at\nfirst sight presented a more singular problem.\"\n\n\nOur proceedings of that first morning did little to advance the\ninvestigation.  It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident\nwhich left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to\nthe spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding,\ncountry lane.  While we made our way along it we heard the rattle of a\ncarriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass.  As it drove\nby us I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly\ncontorted, grinning face glaring out at us.  Those staring eyes and\ngnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.\n\n\"My brothers!\" cried Mortimer Tregennis, white to his lips. \"They are\ntaking them to Helston.\"\n\nWe looked with horror after the black carriage, lumbering upon its way.\nThen we turned our steps towards this ill-omened house in which they\nhad met their strange fate.\n\nIt was a large and bright dwelling, rather a villa than a cottage, with\na considerable garden which was already, in that Cornish air, well\nfilled with spring flowers.  Towards this garden the window of the\nsitting-room fronted, and from it, according to Mortimer Tregennis,\nmust have come that thing of evil which had by sheer horror in a single\ninstant blasted their minds.  Holmes walked slowly and thoughtfully\namong the flower-plots and along the path before we entered the porch.\nSo absorbed was he in his thoughts, I remember, that he stumbled over\nthe watering-pot, upset its contents, and deluged both our feet and the\ngarden path.  Inside the house we were met by the elderly Cornish\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Porter, who, with the aid of a young girl, looked\nafter the wants of the family.  She readily answered all Holmes's\nquestions.  She had heard nothing in the night.  Her employers had all\nbeen in excellent spirits lately, and she had never known them more\ncheerful and prosperous.  She had fainted with horror upon entering the\nroom in the morning and seeing that dreadful company round the table.\nShe had, when she recovered, thrown open the window to let the morning\nair in, and had run down to the lane, whence she sent a farm-lad for\nthe doctor.  The lady was on her bed upstairs if we cared to see her.\nIt took four strong men to get the brothers into the asylum carriage.\nShe would not herself stay in the house another day and was starting\nthat very afternoon to rejoin her family at St. Ives.\n\nWe ascended the stairs and viewed the body.  Miss Brenda Tregennis had\nbeen a very beautiful girl, though now verging upon middle age.  Her\ndark, clear-cut face was handsome, even in death, but there still\nlingered upon it something of that convulsion of horror which had been\nher last human emotion.  From her bedroom we descended to the\nsitting-room, where this strange tragedy had actually occurred.  The\ncharred ashes of the overnight fire lay in the grate.  On the table\nwere the four guttered and burned-out candles, with the cards scattered\nover its surface.  The chairs had been moved back against the walls,\nbut all else was as it had been the night before.  Holmes paced with\nlight, swift steps about the room; he sat in the various chairs,\ndrawing them up and reconstructing their positions.  He tested how much\nof the garden was visible; he examined the floor, the ceiling, and the\nfireplace; but never once did I see that sudden brightening of his eyes\nand tightening of his lips which would have told me that he saw some\ngleam of light in this utter darkness.\n\n\"Why a fire?\" he asked once.  \"Had they always a fire in this small\nroom on a spring evening?\"\n\nMortimer Tregennis explained that the night was cold and damp. For that\nreason, after his arrival, the fire was lit.  \"What are you going to do\nnow, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked.\n\nMy friend smiled and laid his hand upon my arm.  \"I think, Watson, that\nI shall resume that course of tobacco-poisoning which you have so often\nand so justly condemned,\" said he.  \"With your permission, gentlemen,\nwe will now return to our cottage, for I am not aware that any new\nfactor is likely to come to our notice here.  I will turn the facts\nover in my mind, Mr. Tregennis, and should anything occur to me I will\ncertainly communicate with you and the vicar.  In the meantime I wish\nyou both good-morning.\"\n\nIt was not until long after we were back in Poldhu Cottage that Holmes\nbroke his complete and absorbed silence.  He sat coiled in his\narmchair, his haggard and ascetic face hardly visible amid the blue\nswirl of his tobacco smoke, his black brows drawn down, his forehead\ncontracted, his eyes vacant and far away.  Finally he laid down his\npipe and sprang to his feet.\n\n\"It won't do, Watson!\" said he with a laugh.  \"Let us walk along the\ncliffs together and search for flint arrows.  We are more likely to\nfind them than clues to this problem.  To let the brain work without\nsufficient material is like racing an engine.  It racks itself to\npieces.  The sea air, sunshine, and patience, Watson--all else will\ncome.\n\n\"Now, let us calmly define our position, Watson,\" he continued as we\nskirted the cliffs together.  \"Let us get a firm grip of the very\nlittle which we DO know, so that when fresh facts arise we may be ready\nto fit them into their places.  I take it, in the first place, that\nneither of us is prepared to admit diabolical intrusions into the\naffairs of men.  Let us begin by ruling that entirely out of our minds.\nVery good.  There remain three persons who have been grievously\nstricken by some conscious or unconscious human agency.  That is firm\nground.  Now, when did this occur?  Evidently, assuming his narrative\nto be true, it was immediately after Mr. Mortimer Tregennis had left\nthe room.  That is a very important point.  The presumption is that it\nwas within a few minutes afterwards.  The cards still lay upon the\ntable. It was already past their usual hour for bed.  Yet they had not\nchanged their position or pushed back their chairs.  I repeat, then,\nthat the occurrence was immediately after his departure, and not later\nthan eleven o'clock last night.\n\n\"Our next obvious step is to check, so far as we can, the movements of\nMortimer Tregennis after he left the room.  In this there is no\ndifficulty, and they seem to be above suspicion. Knowing my methods as\nyou do, you were, of course, conscious of the somewhat clumsy water-pot\nexpedient by which I obtained a clearer impress of his foot than might\notherwise have been possible.  The wet, sandy path took it admirably.\nLast night was also wet, you will remember, and it was not\ndifficult--having obtained a sample print--to pick out his track among\nothers and to follow his movements.  He appears to have walked away\nswiftly in the direction of the vicarage.\n\n\"If, then, Mortimer Tregennis disappeared from the scene, and yet some\noutside person affected the card-players, how can we reconstruct that\nperson, and how was such an impression of horror conveyed?  Mrs. Porter\nmay be eliminated.  She is evidently harmless.  Is there any evidence\nthat someone crept up to the garden window and in some manner produced\nso terrific an effect that he drove those who saw it out of their\nsenses?  The only suggestion in this direction comes from Mortimer\nTregennis himself, who says that his brother spoke about some movement\nin the garden.  That is certainly remarkable, as the night was rainy,\ncloudy, and dark.  Anyone who had the design to alarm these people\nwould be compelled to place his very face against the glass before he\ncould be seen.  There is a three-foot flower-border outside this\nwindow, but no indication of a footmark.  It is difficult to imagine,\nthen, how an outsider could have made so terrible an impression upon\nthe company, nor have we found any possible motive for so strange and\nelaborate an attempt.  You perceive our difficulties, Watson?\"\n\n\"They are only too clear,\" I answered with conviction.\n\n\"And yet, with a little more material, we may prove that they are not\ninsurmountable,\" said Holmes.  \"I fancy that among your extensive\narchives, Watson, you may find some which were nearly as obscure.\nMeanwhile, we shall put the case aside until more accurate data are\navailable, and devote the rest of our morning to the pursuit of\nneolithic man.\"\n\nI may have commented upon my friend's power of mental detachment, but\nnever have I wondered at it more than upon that spring morning in\nCornwall when for two hours he discoursed upon celts, arrowheads, and\nshards, as lightly as if no sinister mystery were waiting for his\nsolution.  It was not until we had returned in the afternoon to our\ncottage that we found a visitor awaiting us, who soon brought our minds\nback to the matter in hand.  Neither of us needed to be told who that\nvisitor was.  The huge body, the craggy and deeply seamed face with the\nfierce eyes and hawk-like nose, the grizzled hair which nearly brushed\nour cottage ceiling, the beard--golden at the fringes and white near\nthe lips, save for the nicotine stain from his perpetual cigar--all\nthese were as well known in London as in Africa, and could only be\nassociated with the tremendous personality of Dr. Leon Sterndale, the\ngreat lion-hunter and explorer.\n\nWe had heard of his presence in the district and had once or twice\ncaught sight of his tall figure upon the moorland paths. He made no\nadvances to us, however, nor would we have dreamed of doing so to him,\nas it was well known that it was his love of seclusion which caused him\nto spend the greater part of the intervals between his journeys in a\nsmall bungalow buried in the lonely wood of Beauchamp Arriance.  Here,\namid his books and his maps, he lived an absolutely lonely life,\nattending to his own simple wants and paying little apparent heed to\nthe affairs of his neighbours.  It was a surprise to me, therefore, to\nhear him asking Holmes in an eager voice whether he had made any\nadvance in his reconstruction of this mysterious episode.  \"The county\npolice are utterly at fault,\" said he, \"but perhaps your wider\nexperience has suggested some conceivable explanation.  My only claim\nto being taken into your confidence is that during my many residences\nhere I have come to know this family of Tregennis very well--indeed,\nupon my Cornish mother's side I could call them cousins--and their\nstrange fate has naturally been a great shock to me.  I may tell you\nthat I had got as far as Plymouth upon my way to Africa, but the news\nreached me this morning, and I came straight back again to help in the\ninquiry.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Did you lose your boat through it?\"\n\n\"I will take the next.\"\n\n\"Dear me! that is friendship indeed.\"\n\n\"I tell you they were relatives.\"\n\n\"Quite so--cousins of your mother.  Was your baggage aboard the ship?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but the main part at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I see.  But surely this event could not have found its way into the\nPlymouth morning papers.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I had a telegram.\"\n\n\"Might I ask from whom?\"\n\nA shadow passed over the gaunt face of the explorer.\n\n\"You are very inquisitive, Mr. Holmes.\"\n\n\"It is my business.\"\n\nWith an effort Dr. Sterndale recovered his ruffled composure.\n\n\"I have no objection to telling you,\" he said.  \"It was Mr. Roundhay,\nthe vicar, who sent me the telegram which recalled me.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"I may say in answer to your original\nquestion that I have not cleared my mind entirely on the subject of\nthis case, but that I have every hope of reaching some conclusion.  It\nwould be premature to say more.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would not mind telling me if your suspicions point in any\nparticular direction?\"\n\n\"No, I can hardly answer that.\"\n\n\"Then I have wasted my time and need not prolong my visit.\"  The famous\ndoctor strode out of our cottage in considerable ill-humour, and within\nfive minutes Holmes had followed him.  I saw him no more until the\nevening, when he returned with a slow step and haggard face which\nassured me that he had made no great progress with his investigation.\nHe glanced at a telegram which awaited him and threw it into the grate.\n\n\"From the Plymouth hotel, Watson,\" he said.  \"I learned the name of it\nfrom the vicar, and I wired to make certain that Dr. Leon Sterndale's\naccount was true.  It appears that he did indeed spend last
