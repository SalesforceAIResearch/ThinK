{"input": "Who is Hermann Ii, Count Palatine Of Lotharingia's paternal grandfather?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAdolf I of Lotharingia\nAdolf I of Lotharingia, count of Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz from 1008 until 1018, was the son of Hermann I \"Pusillus\" (the Little Pfalzgraf), count palatine of Lotharingia. He left three sons:\n\nHermann III, Vogt of Deutz in St. Severin (Cologne) und Werden (died 1056);\nAdolf II of Lotharingia, count of Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz (born 1002, died 1041);\nErenfried, Probst of St. Severin.\nPassage 2:\nHenry of Laach\nHenry of Laach (in German: Heinrich von Laach) was the first count palatine of the Rhine (1085/1087–1095). Henry was the son of Herman I, count of Gleiberg. Henry was a follower of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He had lands in the southeastern Eifel and on the Moselle River.\nMost of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils. Henry married Herman's widow, Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde (d. 1100). From this marriage, Henry may have taken control over some of her holdings along the Moselle. As a consequence, the geographic center of the palatinate moved towards the south.\nWith his wife, Adelaide, Henry founded the Maria Laach Abbey. He was succeeded by his stepson, Siegfried of Ballenstedt.\nPassage 3:\nHermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHermann II (born 1049; died Dalhem, 20 September 1085), Count Palatine of Lotharingia 1064–1085. He was count in the Ruhrgau and the Zulpichgau, as well as a count of Brabant.\n\nLife\nAccording to Egon Kimpen he was the son of Henry I of Lotharingia († 1061) and Mathild of Verdun († 1060), daughter of Gozelo I of Lotharingia, but the basis for this has been questioned. However, if that is the case, his maternal uncle was Pope Stephen IX. Until 1064, young Hermann was under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, who significantly reduced Hermann's territorial power.\nIn 1080 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde († 1100), widow of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt. She was a daughter of Otto of Orlamünde, count of Weimar and margrave of Meissen in Thuringia, and Adela of Brabant. Together they had two children who had died by 1085.\nHe is assumed to have been the last Count Palatine of Lotharingia of the Ezzonian dynasty. He was killed in a duel with Albert III, Count of Namur, near his castle in Dalhem. \nHis widow married again, her third husband being Henry of Laach, count in the Mayfeldgau, who became the first count palatine of the Rhine between 1085 and 1087.\nPassage 4:\nJohn Christian, Count Palatine of Sulzbach\nJohn Christian (23 January 1700 – 20 July 1733; in German: Johann Christian Joseph) was the Count Palatine of Sulzbach from 1732–33. He was the second and youngest surviving son of duke Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach (1659–1732) with his consort Eleonore Maria Amalia of Hesse-Rotenburg (1675–1720). His elder brother was Joseph Charles, Count Palatine of Sulzbach.\n\nLife\nAfter the death of his elder brother Joseph Charles, John Christian Joseph became the eventual designated heir of the Electoral Palatine. In 1732 he succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach, but died in Sulzbach in 1733 before inheriting the Palatinate.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine, a member of the Palatine Neuburg line of Wittelsbach failed to produce a legitimate male heir, and his brothers also. By 1716 it was evident that the Neuburg line would become extinct and that the Sulzbach branch would succeed them.\n\nMarriage\nHe married twice:\n\nMarie Anne Henriëtte Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne (24 October 1708 – 28 July 1728), daughter of Francois Egon de la Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne, and had the following children:Charles Theodore (11 December 1724 – 16 February 1799); became Elector Palatine in 1742, and Elector of Bavaria in 1777\nMaria Anne (30 May 1728 – 25 June 1728)Eleonore Philippina Christina Sophia of Hesse-Rotenburg  (1712-1759); married on 1731 but had no issue.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 5:\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg (born 19 November 1668 in Neuburg an der Donau; died: 5 April 1693 in Zákupy (German: Reichstadt)) was a  Prince and Count Palatine of Neuburg.\n\nLife\nPhilip William August was the 13th from a total of 17 children of Elector Palatine Philip William (1615-1690) from his second marriage to Elisabeth Amalie (1635-1709), a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHis oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676.  In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.\nPhilip William August chose a secular career and entered into active military service.  He died at the age of 24 after suffering for seven days from a \"malignant fever\" and was buried in the parish church of Zákupy.  His heart lies in the Court Church in Neuburg on the Danube.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married on 29 October 1690 in Raudnitz Anna Maria Franziska (1672–1741), a daughter of Duke Julius Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg.  The wedding ceremony, which had to be postponed due to the illness and death of Philip William August's father, was carried out \"plainly\".  His marriage brought Philipp Wilhelm August the following children:\n\nLeopoldine Eleanor (1691–1693).\nMaria Anna Carolina (1693–1751), married in 1719 Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria (1699–1738).\n\nAncestry\nPassage 6:\nHenry I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHenry I (German: Heinrich; d.1061), was Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1045 until 1060. He was the son of Hezzelin I, Count in Zülpichgau, and a member of the Ezzonid dynasty. Historians have given several nicknames to Heinrich: Furiosus (the Violent/the Insane), because he murdered his wife, and Monachus (the Monk), because he was confined into an abbey to treat his insanity.\n\nLife\nHenry was the son of Hezzelin I and his unnamed wife, who was probably a daughter of  Conrad I of Carinthia.Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX.\nHe received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Henry III's illness.\nShortly after 1058, Henry began to show signs of insanity, for which he was confined to the abbey of Gorze. He escaped however, and thinking that his wife Matilda had been unfaithful to him, he killed her (27 July 1060). Henry then was definitely enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. His office and counties were confiscated by Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, who became the guardian of their only son, the later count palatine Hermann II (1064-1085).\nPassage 7:\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of Tübingen (died 1 November 1247) was Count Palatine of Tübingen and Vogt of Sindelfingen.  He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of Tübingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of Tübingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of Württemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, Sénéchal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of Tübingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).  Their daughter Gertrude Anna (c. 1225 – 16 February 1281) married Emperor Rudolf I, the first Emperor from the House of Habsburg.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 8:\nReichard, Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim\nReichard (25 July 1521 – 13 January 1598) was the Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim from 1569 until 1598.\nReichard was born in Simmern in 1521 to Johann II, Count Palatine of Simmern. In 1569 he succeeded his brother Georg as Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim. Reichard died in Simmern in 1598. Without any surviving children, Simmern-Sponheim was inherited by his great-nephew Frederick IV.\n\nMarriage\nReichard married Juliane of Wied (c. 1545 - 30 April 1575, daughter of Count Johann IV of Wied, on 30 July 1569 and had several children:\n\nJuliana (21 November 1571 – 4 February 1592)\nKatherine (10 May 1573 – 12 October 1576)\nunnamed son (1574)\nunnamed son (30 April 1575)Reichard married Emilie of Württemberg (19 August 1550 - 4 June 1589), daughter of Christoph, Duke of Württemberg, on 26 March 1578.\nReichard married Anne Margaret of Palatinate-Veldenz (17 January 1571 - 1 November 1621), daughter of Count Palatine Georg Johann I, on 14 December 1589.\nPassage 9:\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria (1528–1578) was the daughter of John II, Count Palatine of Simmern and Beatrix of Baden.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1544 she married Lamoral, Count of Egmont with whom she had twelve children. When her husband was arrested and accused of treason in 1567, she wrote king Philip II, the king of Spain, a letter to plead for his release. It was to no avail and he was decapitated in the following year. Sabina was buried in Egmont's crypt in Zottegem.\n\nChildren\nCharles, 7th Count of Egmont, Prince de Gavre: married to Marie de Lens,  Lady of Aubigny.\n\nWidowhood\nAfter her death in 1578, she was buried next to her husband in Zottegem.\nPassage 10:\nOtto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach\nOtto I (24 August 1390 – 5 July 1461) was the Count Palatine of Mosbach from 1410 until 1448, and the Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt from 1448 until 1461.\n\nLife\nOtto was born in Mosbach in 1390 as the youngest son of Rupert III of the Palatinate, King of Germany. In 1410 after the death of his father, the territories of the Palatinate were divided between his four sons; Otto received the territory around Mosbach and Eberbach. He made Mosbach his capital and began the construction of a new residence there. Otto became the regent of the Electorate of the Palatinate and guardian of his nephew Louis IV after his brother Louis III returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem seriously ill and died soon after. He held the regency until 1442.\nIn 1448 he inherited half of the territory of the extinct Palatinate-Neumarkt line and purchased the other half from his brother Stephen, and he also established a residence in Neumarkt. Otto died in Reichenbach in 1461 and was buried in the Benedictine Reichenbach Abbey.\n\nMarriage\nOtto married Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (1413 - 20 July 1444), daughter of duke Henry XVI in January 1430 and had the following children:\n\nMargaret (2 March 1432 - 14 September 1457)\nAmalie (22 February 1433 - 5 December 1488)\nOtto (26 June 1435 - 8 April 1499)\nRupert (25 November 1437 - 1 November 1465)\nDorothea (24 August 1439 - 15 May 1482) Prioress in the Liebenau monastery\nAlbert (6 September 1440 -  20 August 1506)\nAnne (1441 - ?)

{"input": "Where was the director of film Requiem For Dominic born?", "context": "Passage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 2:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad.

He competed in the men's tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 3:\nMaria al-Qibtiyya\nMāriyya bint Shamʿūn (Arabic: ماریة بنت شمعون), better known as Māriyyah al-Qibṭiyyah or al-Qubṭiyya (Arabic: مارية القبطية), or Maria the Copt, died 637, was an Egyptian woman who, along with her sister Sirin bint Shamun, was sent to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 628 as a gift by Al-Muqawqis, a Christian governor of Alexandria, during the territory's Sasanian occupation. She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: ⲡⲙⲁⲛϩⲁⲃⲓⲛ, Koinē Greek: Ἀλάβαστρων πόλις Alábastrōn pólis, Arabic: الخفن, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antinoöpolis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 – 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year Hātib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing Māriyah and her sister Sīrīn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'fūr, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. Hātib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and Māriyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milhān. Māriyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister Sīrīn to Hassān b. Thābit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahmān b. Hassān.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa’d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet’s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn ‘Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ‘Her son has set her free.’  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but ‘Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: “O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.’ until the end of the Verse.”\nThe ‘female-slave’ referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn ‘Abbas and ‘Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asbāb al-nuzūl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (ﷺ) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (ﷺ) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God’s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah’s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-‘Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus‘ab b. ‘Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus‘ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\nʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad (Arabic: عَبْد ٱللَّٰه ٱبْن مُحَمَّد) also known as al-Ṭāhir (lit. 'the pure') and al-Ṭayyib (lit. 'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: الامين), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbrāhīm ibn Muḥammad (Arabic: إِبْرَاهِيم ٱبْن مُحَمَّد), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bidāya wa-n-Nihāya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn ʿAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-ʿAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living. Anything that man does, God wishes him to do well.\"\n\nSiblings\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nAbd Allah ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatimah al-Zahra bint Muhammad\n\nSee also\nIslam and children\nPassage 7:\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn (Ibn al-Walid)\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (Arabic: إبراهيم بن الحسين بن علي بن محمد بن الوليد, romanized: Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Walīd) was the eleventh Tayyibi Isma'ili Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq in Yemen, from 1287 to his death in 1328.\n\nLife\nIbrahim was a member of the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, that dominated the office of Dāʿī al-Muṭlaq almost continuously in the 13th to early 16th centuries. He was the son of the eighth Dāʿī, Al-Husayn ibn Ali, and brother of the ninth Dāʿī, Ali ibn al-Husayn. Ibrahim moved his seat from Sanaa to the fortress of Af'ida, and in 1325 he took over the town of Kawkaban, where he started gathering military forces to oppose the Zaydi imams.He was succeeded by Muhammad ibn Hatim (1327–1328), who in turn was succeeded by Ibrahim's son Ali Shams al-Din I.\n\nTomb\nHis grave, along with those of the 12th and 13th Dāʿīs, were hidden and unknown until recently, when the archaeological authority of Yemen, along with Dawoodi Bohras living there, located them on Hisn Af'ida.

It was Fassbinder's last film, released shortly after his death at the age of 37.\n\nPlot\nThe plot centers on the handsome Belgian sailor Georges Querelle, who is also a thief and murderer. When his ship, Le Vengeur, arrives in Brest, he visits the Feria, a bar and brothel for sailors run by the Madame Lysiane, whose lover, Robert, is Querelle's brother. Querelle has a love/hate relationship with his brother: when they meet at La Feria, they embrace, but also punch one another slowly and repeatedly in the belly. Lysiane's husband Nono works behind the bar and also manages La Feria's underhanded affairs with the assistance of his friend, the corrupt police captain Mario.\nQuerelle makes a deal to sell opium to Nono. During the execution of the deal, he murders his accomplice Vic by slitting his throat.  After delivering the drugs, Querelle announces that he wants to sleep with Lysiane.  He knows that this means he will have to throw dice with Nono, who has the privilege of playing a game of chance with all of her prospective lovers. If Nono loses, the suitor is allowed to proceed with his affair. If the suitor loses, however, he must submit to anal sex with Nono first, according to Nono's maxim that \"That way, I can say my wife only sleeps with arseholes.\" Querelle deliberately loses the game, allowing himself to be sodomized by Nono. When Nono gloats about Querelle's \"loss\" to Robert, who won his dice game, the brothers end up in a violent fight.  Later, Querelle becomes Lysiane's lover, and also has sex with Mario.\nLuckily for Querelle, a builder, Gil, murders his work mate Theo, who had been harassing and sexually assaulting him.  Gil hides from the police in an abandoned prison, and Roger, who is in love with Gil, establishes contact between Querelle and Gil in the hopes that Querelle can help Gil flee. Querelle falls in love with Gil, who closely resembles his brother.  Gil returns his affections, but Querelle betrays Gil by tipping off the police. Querelle cleverly arranged it so that the murder of Vic is also blamed on Gil.\nQuerelle's superior, Lieutenant Seblon, is in love with Querelle, and constantly tries to prove his manliness to him. Seblon is aware that Querelle murdered Vic, but chooses to protect him.  Later, Seblon reveals his love and concern to a drunken Querelle, and they kiss and embrace before returning to Le Vengeur.\n\nCast\nBrad Davis as Querelle\nFranco Nero as Lieutenant Seblon\nJeanne Moreau as Lysiane\nLaurent Malet as Roger Bataille\nHanno Pöschl as Robert / Gil\nGünther Kaufmann as Nono\nBurkhard Driest as Mario\nRoger Fritz as Marcellin\nDieter Schidor as Vic Rivette\nNatja Brunckhorst as Paulette\nWerner Asam as Worker\nAxel Bauer as Worker\nNeil Bell as Theo\nRobert van Ackeren as Drunken legionnaire\nWolf Gremm as Drunken legionnaire\nFrank Ripploh as Drunken legionnaire\n\nProduction\nAccording to Genet's biographer Edmund White, Querelle was originally going to be made by Werner Schroeter, with a scenario by Burkhard Driest, and produced by Dieter Schidor. However, Schidor could not find the money to finance a film by Schroeter, and therefore turned to other directors, including John Schlesinger and Sam Peckinpah, before finally settling on Fassbinder. Driest wrote a radically different script for Fassbinder, who then \"took the linear narrative and jumbled it up\". White quotes Schidor as saying \"Fassbinder did something totally different, he took the words of Genet and tried to meditate on something other than the story. The story became totally unimportant for him. He also said publicly that the story was a sort of third-rate police story that wouldn't be worth making a movie about without putting a particular moral impact into it\".Schroeter had wanted to make a black and white film with amateur actors and location shots, but Fassbinder instead shot it with professional actors in a lurid, expressionist color, and on sets in the studio. Edmund White comments that the result is a film in which, \"Everything is bathed in an artificial light and the architectural elements are all symbolic.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nJeanne Moreau – \"Each Man Kills the Things He Loves\" (music by Peer Raben, lyrics from Oscar Wilde's poem \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\")\n\"Young and Joyful Bandit\" (Music by Peer Raben, lyrics by Jeanne Moreau)Both songs were nominated to the 1984 Razzie Awards for \"Worst Original Song\".\n\nRelease\nQuerelle sold more than 100,000 tickets in the first three weeks after its release in Paris, the first time that a film with a gay theme had achieved such success. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, which categorizes reviews as positive or negative only, the film has an approval rating of 57% calculated based on 14 critics comments. By comparison, with the same opinions being calculated using a weighted arithmetic mean, the rating is 6.10/10. Writing for The New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted that Querelle was \"a mess...a detour that leads to a dead end.\"\nPenny Ashbrook calls Querelle Fassbinder's \"perfect epitaph: an intensely personal statement that is the most uncompromising portrayal of gay male sensibility to come from a major filmmaker.\" Edmund White considers Querelle the only film based on Genet's book that works, calling it \"visually as artificial and menacing as Genet's prose.\" Genet, in discussion with Schidor, said that he had not seen the film, commenting \"You can't smoke at the movies.\"\nPassage 10:\nIronmaster (film)\nIronmaster (Italian: La guerra del ferro: Ironmaster) is a 1983 film directed by Umberto Lenzi.\n\nProduction\nIronmaster was filmed on location at Custer State Park in South Dakota with interiors shot at RPA-Elios Studios in Rome.\n\nRelease\nIronmaster was released in Italy on 10 March 1983. The film was released on Blu-ray on 23 January 2017 in North America by Code Red and on 10 April 2017 in the United Kingdom by 88 Films.\n\nReception\nAccording to Michael Klossner, author of Prehistoric Humans in Film and Television, while Ironmaster received \"few and very bad notices [and is] simple, only modestly ambitious and has its share of flaws … it's hard not to like a film which shows intelligent, articulate prehistoric people making discoveries, facing moral issues and showing capacity for great evil and finally for good.\" Hal Erickson wrote in AllMovie that \"Seldom has there been a more predictable 98 minutes' worth of Sword and Sorcery, but that doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable.\"", "answers": ["Mickey'S Tent Show"], "length": 2858, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4adca5ba1654b740d1e25c6e73d45aa2f3621537bed9086b"}

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nAvital Tamir\nAvital Tamir (Hebrew: אביטל תמיר) is an Israeli musician best known for his work as the lead singer for metal band Betzefer and for his experimental pop trio On Shoulders of Giants. He was also briefly a member of fellow Betzefer bandmate Matan Cohen's death metal band Nail Within.\n\nMusical career\nBetzefer (1998–2016)\nAvital Tamir formed Betzefer along with guitarist Matan Cohen and drummer Roey Berman as a one-off band for a high school gig in 1998.\nWhat started as a high school gig became a big part of the lives of the band members and since then the band started working, first as a cover band and later they started recording their own material, releasing Pitz Aachbar in 2000 and the EP New Hate in 2003. In 2005, the band released its first full-length album Down Low.\nTamir was the vocalist for the band since its formation and appeared on all of the band's releases, until his departure in 2016. He was replaced by Aharon Ragoza.\n\nNail Within (2003, 2007)\nIn 2003, after Nail Within vocalist Yishay Swearts left, guitarist Matan Cohen brought his Betzefer bandmates Avital Tamir (on vocals) and Rotem Inbar (on bass) to play with the band. After few rehearsals the idea fell through and the band disbanded. Although, before those events, Tamir did guest on some live shows of Nail Within. \n\nIn 2007, before reuniting the whole line-up, Cohen brought Tamir once again to rehearse with the band. Again, the collaboration wasn't long and soon the whole old line-up reunited.\nIt is being rumored that Avital Tamir, along with Betzefer bassist Rotem Inbar, will be involved in the new proposed album by Nail Within, though this wasn't confirmed, but it is known that Matan Cohen, Avital Tamir and Rotem Inbar, are all active in Nail Within.\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants (2006–present)\nIn 2006, Avital took time off from touring with Betzefer to start a new project dubbed On Shoulders of Giants together with 7% Mind Usage guitarist Idan Epshtein and Jerusalem based singer Katie Danielson. The three recorded their debut album titled Come Crashing, which was released independently on September 17, 2009. Avital handled most of the guitar duties on the record as well as the vocals, and the bass.\n\nBlack Swan (2010–present)\nIn early 2010, Tamir has started the alternative/garage rock band Black Swan with ex-Got No Shame lead guitarist Matan Ergas (AKA Nose). The band has played extensively in Israel through 2010 while Betzefer was on hiatus, playing both full band electric shows, as well as many stripped-down acoustic shows, even playing one whole show in two parts: opening with acoustic and main show as a full-band.\nThe band has recorded several demos which were upped to the band's Facebook page. The band planned to record the album sometime in 2011. Around that time, Tamir promoted Betzefer's second album Freedom to the Slave Makers released in February 2011.\n\nDiscography\nBetzefer\nPitz Aachbar (2000)\nSome Tits, But No Bush (2001)\nNew Hate (2003)\nDown Low (2005)\nFreedom to The Slave Makers (2011)\nThe Devil Went Down to the Holy Land (2013)\n\nOn Shoulders of Giants\nCome Crashing (2009)\nPassage 10:\nTom Dickinson\nThomas or Tom Dickinson may refer to: \n\nThomas Dickenson, or Dickinson, merchant and politician of York, England\nThomas R.

It was also shown in Grandeur at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles, from February 28, 1930.\nAt a screening at the Roxy Theater, film critic Mordaunt Hall praised the cinematography, which was noted to be enhanced by the wider format. However, he regarded the film itself as \"not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do.\"Owing to the Great Depression, few movie theaters invested in equipment for this format and it was soon abandoned. Fox Film Corporation's heavy investment in Grandeur technology led to William Fox losing his business, which was eventually merged in 1935 with Twentieth Century Pictures to form 20th Century Fox. No widescreen print of Happy Days is known to have survived.\n\nSee also\nList of early sound feature films (1926–1929)", "answers": ["no"], "length": 3470, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "16a0130f95804e9b0791a89e2d18e46f611c1620891658b8"}

He is conceived when his mother Maria is attracted to a mysterious stranger during a performance of The Magic Flute. The stranger disappears after the conception, and as a result Andris does not know his father. The law states that a boy should have his father's name, even if the father is unknown, to avoid the taint of illegitimacy. When Maria tries to register Andris with the child custody department, Andris is given the name of a fictitious father. She enters on Andris' birth certificate the name of the bureaucrat she is dealing with, Antal Orban.\nMaria dies when she is hit on the head by a falling brick, an accident resulting from being in the wrong place at the wrong time, leaving Andris suddenly motherless. He then goes off in search of his nonexistent father. Along the way he meets and is helped by The Girl, the young nurse who delivered him, and who is alone like Andris. Meanwhile, the kindly Orban becomes tired of the tyrannical bureaucracy, and decides to destroy the files of children he has helped to legitimize by giving them fictitious fathers. He then sets out to find Andris. Andris and The Girl finally meet Orban, and they form their own family.\nThey meet scouts being trained as instruments of the state, and the scouts pursue Andris, Orban and The Girl.

He directed more than 90 films between 1934 and 1978. His 1958 film That Won't Keep a Sailor Down was entered into the 1st Moscow International Film Festival. Two years later, his 1960 film Big Request Concert was entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival. His career encompassed both Nazi cinema and West German productions. He also wrote several books on the 1930s and 1940s wave of German cinema.\n\nCareer\nIn his early teens, Rabenalt began his stage career directing operas at theatres in Darmstadt, Berlin and Gera. From then on to the mid-1920s he worked (though uncredited) as a production assistant on several films such including G. W. Pabst's Joyless Street (1925). After Nazi's rise to power, Rabenalt made his feature film debut directing the musical comedy, What Am I Without You (1934), which was then shortly followed with the release of the comedy Pappi (1934). He continued to work in different genres, including The Love of the Maharaja (1936), and Men Are That Way and Midsummer Night's Fire which were released in 1939.        \nThrough out the 1940s, Rabaenalt worked with melodramatic dramas and comedy. Some of his early films in the 1940s, such as Riding for Germany, supported Nazi ideology. In 1989, he said \"I had only made circus films and chamber-type entertainment films since 1941. The only Nazi film I knew was ... rides for Germany (1941), and it was admired. The first films of mine that were distributed again after the war were Circus Renz (1943) and Regimental Music (shot in 1944 under the title The Guilty of Gabriele Rottweil, the film only came to the cinemas in 1950). The controversy about ... rides for Germany came much later.After the war he resumed his stage career as a director, beginning with the East German production, Chemistry and Love (1948), satire on anti-capitalism based on a play by Bela Balasz. He continued to work on productions for East German state studio DEFA until 1948. In the 1950s, he moved into more mainstream entertainment, including the Weimar horror remake of Alraune (1952), which starred Hildegard Knef and Erich von Stroheim.            \nFrom 1960, Rabanalt worked only in television, adapting classic comedies and operettas for a mainstream audience.

During World War II, when he was 13, he left his parents home and lived alone in Budapest. During the Holocaust, his mother and two younger sisters were murdered, while his father, brother and older sister were saved. Later, he was taken to a labor camp in Yugoslavia and worked in copper mining until he was liberated by local partisans, whom he joined in fighting the Germans until his immigration to Palestine in 1944 at age 18. Atzmoni wanted to join the military, but was concerned that his slim figure would cause him to be rejected, so he said he was two years older than he was.\n\nMilitary career\nAfter immigrating to Palestine, Atzmoni joined the Jewish Settlement Police and dealt with Naharayim. Following an Arab Legion attack, he retreated with the guards and reached the nearby base of the 12th Battalion of the Golani Brigade. He joined the ranks of the brigade and after a sergeant course was stationed as a company sergeant and served in this position during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Later, He joined the artillery corps, where he served in reserves for many years. In 1969, following severe manpower shortage in the Israel Defense Forces, he responded to a request by its Chief of General Staff and returned for a year of voluntary service in the artillery corps.\n\nDecorations\nIn September 1948, Atzmoni cleared a fire-focused ammunition box during battle and received a commendation from the brigade commander.In January 1949, Atzmoni's unit was attacked near Rafah. A military car was blocking the artillery's line of sight, preventing an effective response. Atzmoni ran, under heavy fire, and was able to start the car and move it, thus clearing the way for the artillery to act and destroy 18 enemy vehicles. For this he was awarded the Hero of Israel commendation, which is the highest commendation ever awarded by the IDF, given to only twelve soldiers:\n\n On January 4, 1949, in the battle for the cemetery in Rafah, our artillery car was stopped in the field and the entire sector was concealed in front of our cannon position. The enemy, which attacked tanks and armored vehicles accompanied by infantry, rained fire on the outpost and prevented any action to remove the car from the area. Lt. Col. Arieh Otzmany, whose job was to bring ammunition and digging equipment to the outpost, jumped at the car, managed to start it, and drove it from the front to the rear, enabling our anti-tank cannon to launch an operation that resulted in the use of nine tanks and other enemy vehicles.\n\nLater life and death\nFollowing his discharge from the military, Atzmoni settled in the Hadar neighborhood in Haifa with his wife Lea (née Lustig), and worked as a cab driver. Concurrently, he imported and sold car parts. The two then established the Haifa branch of car rental company Hertz, which flourished. They then established their own car rental agency, also successful, allowing him donate some earnings to charity. After decades, the couple retired to the Ahuza retirement home. He died on March 30, 2005, and was buried in Haifa with a military ceremony. He had a son, daughter and four grandchildren.\nPassage 10:\nThe Hero of My Dreams\nThe Hero of My Dreams (German: Der Held meiner Träume) is a 1960 West German romantic comedy film directed by Arthur Maria Rabenalt and starring Carlos Thompson, Heidi Brühl and Peter Vogel.It was shot at the Bavaria Studios in Munich.

He is best known for his recordings of \"Skylark\" and \"'Round Midnight\" from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.\n\nMusic career\nEarly years\nParis was born and raised in Nutley, New Jersey, to an Italian-American family, where he attended Nutley High School. His uncle Chick had been a guitarist with Paul Whiteman's orchestra. Paris was a popular child entertainer in vaudeville who shared the stage with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson and the Mills Brothers. He tap danced from his youth and into his years in the US Army.\nAfter serving in the army during World War II, he was inspired by his friend Nat King Cole to assemble a trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals. The Jackie Paris Trio was a hit at the Onyx Club on New York's 52nd Street.\n\nRecording and performing\nHe recorded from the 1940s into the 2000s. His albums include Songs by Jackie Paris (EmArcy), Jackie Paris Sings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time), and The Song Is Paris (Impulse!). The first song that he recorded was \"Skylark\", on one of two sessions made by his trio for MGM Records in 1947. He recorded Thelonious Monk's \"Round Midnight\", which was produced by the critic Leonard Feather and featured a young Dick Hyman on piano.\nIn 1949, he toured with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra and was invited to join Duke Ellington's Orchestra, but he was too exhausted to take it. Paris was part of the Lionel Hampton Orchestra that played at the famed Cavalcade of Jazz in Los Angeles at Wrigley Field which was produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. on July 10, 1949. They did a second concert at Lane Field in San Diego on September 3, 1949. He was the only vocalist to tour as a regular member of the Charlie Parker Quintet. Unfortunately, no recordings exist of the Parker–Paris combination, but there is a photograph of the two working together. He worked often with Charles Mingus, who called Paris his favorite singer and recorded with him often, including 1952's \"Paris in Blue\" and \"Duke Ellington's Sound of Love\" on the album Changes Two in 1974.\nDuring the 1960s–70s, Paris frequently performed with his wife at the time Anne Marie Moss.Paris performed or recorded with Bobby Scott, Charlie Shavers, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Donald Byrd, Eddie Costa, Gigi Gryce, Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Johnny Mandel, Lee Konitz, Max Roach, Neal Hefti, Oscar Pettiford, Ralph Burns, Terry Gibbs, Tony Scott, and Wynton Kelly.\nA documentary about him, 'Tis Autumn: The Search for Jackie Paris came out in 2006.\n\nRecognition\nHe won many jazz polls and awards, including those of Down Beat, Playboy, Swing Journal, and Metronome. In 1953, he was named Best New Male Vocalist of the Year in the first Down Beat Critics Poll. The winning female vocalist was Ella Fitzgerald, who repeatedly named Paris as one of her favorites.\nIn 2001, Paris played to a standing room crowd – and to a standing ovation – at New York's Birdland jazz club in Times Square. He was virtually the only performer to have appeared at every incarnation of the famed night spot, from the legendary Birdland of the 1950s to the present.\nHe was praised by comic Lenny Bruce, who shared the bill with him on many occasions. Bruce said, \"I dig his talent. The audience loves him and he gets laughs. He is too much!\"\n\nAwards and honors\nNew Star Male Vocalist, Down Beat Critics Poll, 1953\nBest Male Vocalist, Playboy Musicians & Critics Poll, 1957–1961\nGold Disc Award, Lucky to Be Me, Swing Journal, 1989\n\nDiscography\nSongs by Jackie Paris (Wing, 1956)\nSkylark (Brunswick, 1957)\nThe Jackie Paris Sound (EastWest, 1958)\nThe Song Is Paris (Impulse!, 1962)\nSings the Lyrics of Ira Gershwin (Time, 1962)\nLive at the Maisonette with Anne Marie Moss (Differant Drummer, 1975)\nJackie Paris (Audiophile, 1981)\nNobody Else but Me (Audiophile, 1988)\nLucky to Be Me (EmArcy, 1989)\nLove Songs (EmArcy, 1990)\nThe Intimate Jackie Paris (Hudson, 2001)\nPassage 9:\n55 (number)\n55 (fifty-five) is the natural number following 54 and preceding 56.\n\nMathematics\n55 is \n\na triangular number (the sum of the consecutive numbers 1 to 10), and a doubly triangular number.\nthe 10th Fibonacci number.

{"input": "What is the place of birth of Anne Elizabeth Rector's husband?", "context": "Passage 1:\nAnne Elizabeth Rector\nAnne Elizabeth Rector (June 26, 1899 – February 17, 1970) was an American artist.\nRector was the daughter of Enoch J. Rector and she attended the Art Students League of New York studying under John French Sloan. Ann also studied landscape painting under Andrew Dasburg. She married Edmund Duffy and they moved to New York City in 1948, when her husband began work for the Saturday Evening Post. She later headed Rector Studios that manufactured glass top tables. Her daughter married Ivan Chermayeff, the son of Serge Ivan Chermayeff.Rector's childhood diaries were published in 2004. They had been found many years after Rector's death and described her life for the year of 1912.\nPassage 2:\nEdmund Duffy\nEdmund Duffy (March 1, 1899 – September 12, 1962), was an American editorial cartoonist.  He grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, eventually moving to metropolitan areas. Duffy did not attend high school, but instead went into the Art Students League of New York. Duffy's career took him to London, Paris, New York, and finally to Baltimore, where he spent the majority of his professional career working for The Baltimore Sun.\nDuffy won three Pulitzer Prizes for Editorial Cartooning in 1931, 1934, and 1940. Duffy began working for the Baltimore Sun in 1924, when he was only about 25 years old, and he received high praise from the famous journalist H.L. Mencken.\n\nJournalism career\nDuffy first came into the journalism field with his submission of a page of sketches for Armistice Day. The sketches were put into the New York Tribune in the Sunday section. Duffy worked on a variety of assignments in order to save up money, then launching his European career. He moved to London and worked for the London Evening News. Duffy worked in Paris for a few years, and he finally returned to the United States in 1922. He worked for two years with both the New York Leader and the Brooklyn Eagle.\nThe longest period of his career began in 1924 when he began working for The Baltimore Sun. Duffy worked there until 1948, in order to work a less tiring job, working for the Saturday Evening Post.  Duffy drew numerous noteworthy cartoons, approaching major issues and incidents, such as lynching and the Ku Klux Klan, but also the famous Monkey Scopes Trial of 1925.\n\nDenouncing racism through art\nDuffy was known for his daring nature in relation to his work. H.L. Mencken saw promise in his work and “Duffy with his sometimes savage artwork, did the kind of thing that delighted Mencken, who loved nothing more than to ‘stir up the animals’”. Duffy was not afraid to please Mencken, and held nothing back  He was one of the few people of his time that would boldly approach the topic of racism.  He blatantly condemned lynching and the actions of the KKK.  This was one of his main issues that he approached during his career.  During the time period that Duffy worked it was not popular to advocate against racism, so Duffy was civil rights before it was a wide movement in the United States. S.L. Harrison, a late professor of Communication at the University of Miami, wrote that Duffy “displayed uncommon vigor in attacking the Ku Klux Klan”.\n\nScopes Trial\nJust a year after Duffy began working for The Baltimore Sun, 1925, a famous trial began in Tennessee.  Tennessee had passed a law, the Butler Act, barring teachers against the topic of evolution in the classroom, but one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, ignored the law and taught his students evolution.  Scopes decided that the students should learn evolution, even if it went against the teachings of the bible.  Since the trial was popular and a nationwide topic, Mencken took a staff from The Sun, including Duffy, to cover the trial.  “[Edmund Duffy’s] graphic artwork played a significant role in the public’s perception of the trial proceedings reported in the pages of The Sun, then one of America’s most influential newspapers”.  His cartoons brought more attention to the issue, as he derided Tennessee for crushing knowledge in one of his more notable cartoons from the trial called ‘A Closed Book in Tennessee.’ \nIn this cartoon, Duffy shows a man, representing Tennessee, holding a sign that says “Fundamentalists Only Wanted as Teachers.”  The man is standing on top of the book of knowledge, holding it shut.  Duffy knew that this powerful cartoon would cause a great response, but that is exactly what Mencken wanted and expected from him.  Many more of his cartoons from the trial held the same message, in which he was publicly shaming Tennessee for the law, the trial, and the verdict.  Mencken once said that with a good cartoonist he would not need a whole editorial staff, and a great cartoonist he found in Duffy.\n\nPulitzer Prizes\nOver Edmund Duffy's career, he won three Pulitzer Prizes, which is a lot compared to other recipients over the years.  His three prize winning cartoons are the following:\n“An Old Struggle Still Going On” (1931)\nThis cartoon references the anti-communism era that began in the 1920s and 1930s.  At the time, communism was seen as being anti-religion, which is what Duffy conveys in the cartoon.  \n“California Points with Pride!” (1934)\nThis cartoon is one of Duffy's many anti-lynching pieces.  This one, however, deals with white on white lynching.  In California, people took two kidnappers from prison and lynched them in a park, but the Governor praised the people that did the lynching.  Duffy condemned the Governor in this cartoon.\n“The 'Outstretched Hand'” (1940)\nIn this cartoon, Duffy's topic is Adolf Hitler and his brutality.  By the time the cartoon was drawn, Germany had already invaded Poland, and Duffy shows Hitler's broken promises and peace offerings.  Hitler's hand drips with blood in the image.\nPassage 3:\nAnne Evans\nAnne or Ann Evans may refer to:\n\nAnn Evans (midwife) (1840–1916), New Zealand nurse\nAnne Evans (poet) (1820–1870), English poet and composer\nAnne Evans (arts patron) (1871–1941), art patron in Colorado\nAnne Evans (soprano) (born 1941), British operatic soprano\nAnne Evans Estabrook, American real estate developer\n\nSee also\nMary Ann Evans, writer better known as George Eliot\nMary Anne Disraeli, née Evans, wife of Disraeli\nEvans (surname)\nPassage 4:\nJames Randall Marsh\nJames Randall Marsh (1896–1966) was an American artist and the husband of Anne Steele Marsh.\n\nBiography\nMarsh was born in 1896 in Paris, France. He was the son of Frederick Dana Marsh and Alice Randall Marsh. He was the brother of the painter Reginald Marsh.He married Anne Steele in 1925 and the couple settled in Essex Fells, New Jersey. There Marsh set up a metal forge which he used to create industrial and residential lighting fixtures. In 1948, the Marshes relocated to Pittstown, New Jersey where James continued operating a forge, expanding the operation to include decorative metal work. His work was mainly in the American Arts and Craft style.\nIn 1952, Marsh was instrumental in establishing the Hunterdon Art Museum. When an 1836 stone mill became available for sale, Marsh and his neighbors decided to turn it into an art center, with Marsh providing most of the purchase price. The museum, with workshops, is still in operation and the building is listed as Dunham's Mill on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.In 1964, he purchased the M. C. Mulligan & Sons Quarry, also listed on the NRHP, and donated it to the Clinton Historical Museum, now known as the Red Mill Museum Village. On October 9, 1965, the James Randall Marsh Historical Park was dedicated at the museum.Marsh died on January 20, 1966, in Flemington.\nPassage 5:\nMichael Rector\nMichael Rector (born December 16, 1993) is a former American football wide receiver.

They briefly attended North Texas State University together, before marrying in 1961 and moving to San Francisco in 1962, to enroll at San Francisco State University, where they both earned their bachelor's and master's degrees.\nRice was a professor of English and Creative Writing at San Francisco State University. In 1977, he received the Academy of American Poets' Edgar Allan Poe Award for Whiteboy, and in subsequent years was also the recipient of the Joseph Henry Jackson Award, as well as a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Rice retired after 22 years as Chairman of the Creative Writing program as well as Assistant Director of the Poetry Center in 1989.It was the death of his and Anne's first child, daughter Michele (1966–1972), at age six of leukemia, which led to Stan Rice becoming a published author. His first book of poems, based on his daughter's illness and death, was titled Some Lamb, and was published in 1975. He encouraged his wife to quit her work as a waitress, cook and theater usher in order to devote herself full-time to her writing, and both eventually encouraged their son, novelist Christopher Rice, to become a published author as well.\n\nRice, his wife and his son moved to Garden District, New Orleans, in 1988, where he eventually opened the Stan Rice Gallery. In 1989, they purchased the Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard.\nStan Rice's paintings are represented in the collections of the Ogden Museum of Southern Art and the New Orleans Museum of Art.

Prospective plans are underway to present exhibitions of Rice's paintings at various locations in Mexico.In Prism of the Night, Anne Rice said of Stan: \"He's a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is admirable. Very early on he said to me, 'What more could you ask for than life itself'?\"\nPoet Deborah Garrison was Rice's editor at Alfred A. Knopf for his 2002 collection, Red to the Rind, which was dedicated to novelist son Christopher, in whose success as a writer his father greatly rejoiced. Garrison said of Rice: \"Stan really attempted to kind of stare down the world, and I admire that.\"Knopf's Victoria Wilson, who edited Anne's novels and worked with Stan Rice on his 1997 book, Paintings, was particularly impressed by his refusal to sell his artworks, saying, \"The great thing about Stan is that he refused to play the game as a painter, and he refused to play the game as a poet.\"\n\nPersonal life\nRice was an atheist.\n\nDeath\nStan Rice died of brain cancer at age 60, on December 9, 2002, in New Orleans where he lived and was survived by Anne and Christopher, as well as his mother, Margaret; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy and Cynthia.\nRice is entombed in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.\n\nPoetry collections\nSome Lamb (1975)\nWhiteboy (1976) (earned the Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Academy of American Poets)\nBody of Work (1983)\nSinging Yet: New and Selected Poems (1992)\nFear Itself (1997)\nThe Radiance of Pigs (1999)\nRed to the Rind (2002)\nFalse Prophet (2003) (Posthumous)\n\nPoetry video recordings\nTwo series of recordings – one from 1973 at San Francisco State University and the other from 1996 at the poet's New Orleans home by filmmaker Blair Murphy – capturing Stan Rice reading several of his poems are on the YouTube site dedicated to the poet.\n\nOther books\nPaintings (1997)\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nPassage 7:\nStan Marks\nStan Marks is an Australian writer and journalist.

He also served as the first gentleman of Rajasthan and also as mayor of Amravati. He was a member of the Indian National Congress.\n\nEarly life\nDevisingh Ramsingh Shekhawat, who was then a lecturer in chemistry, married Pratibha Patil on 7 July 1965. The couple had a daughter and a son, Raosaheb Shekhawat, who is also a politician.Shekhawat was awarded a PhD from the University of Mumbai in 1972. Prior to his wife's elevation to her presidential role, he had been principal of a college operated by his wife's Vidya Bharati Shikshan Sanstha foundation and also a First Mayor of Amravati (1991–1992). Like his wife, he was a member of the Indian National Congress party. He was also an agriculturalist and a former member of the Legislative Assembly, being elected for the period 1985–1990 from the Amravati constituency in the Maharashtra state legislature. He lost his deposit in the 1995 contest for that constituency.Various accusations against Shekhawat and Patil emerged after the latter was nominated for the office of president. Among these was the case of Kisan Dhage, a teacher in a school run by Vidya Prasarak Shikshan Mandal in Buldana district, who committed suicide in November 1998. He left a note saying that he was committing suicide because he was tired of the mental harassment caused by Shekhawat, who was chairman of the institution, and four others. When the police registered the case as \"accidental death\", Dhage's wife appealed to the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) in Jalgaon Jamod, a tehsil in Buldana district. The JMFC ordered the police to start criminal proceedings. Shekhawat petitioned the courts seeking dismissal of charges of abetting Dhage's suicide. Two lower courts turned down this plea and by June 2007 the issue was pending in the Bombay High Court. A judge at that court dismissed the charges against Shekhawat in 2009 on the grounds that there was no proof of direct involvement, although one of his co-accused remained subject to the proceedings.In 2009, a court ruled that Shekhawat had colluded with five relatives and local officials to illegally transfer into his ownership 2.5 acres (1.0 ha) of land in Chandrapur belonging to a Dalit farmer. This was one of several allegations of corruption and irregularities to emerge during Patil's presidency in relation to her and her family.\n\nFirst Gentleman of Rajasthan (2004–2007)\nUpon Shekhawat's wife's succession as governor of Rajasthan, he moved into Raj Bhavan, Jaipur succeeding as the first gentleman of Rajasthan for 3 years.\n\nFirst Gentleman of India (2007–2012)\nOn 25 July 2007 Shekhawat became the first first gentleman of India upon his wife's succession as the twelfth — and first woman — President of India for a full five-year term.\n\nDeath\nShekhawat died on 24 February 2023 at the age of 89.", "answers": ["Jersey City"], "length": 3648, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "14387a7ce67635d6f5c75fd29b6d3344758a8be64311ea6e"}

He was brought up at Rome, in the school of Pietro da Cortona, and was employed in several prominent public works during the pontificate of Alexander VII. He painted historical subjects. He died in 1686 at Rieti.\nIn the Quirinal, he painted The Judgment of Solomon, and others of his works are in Santa Maria Maggiore and in the Rotunda.

In the first innings of his first match, against Lancashire at The Oval, he took five wickets for 81 runs.In his first full season, 1948, he was Surrey's leading wicket-taker and in the last home game of the season he was awarded his county cap – he celebrated by taking eight Northamptonshire wickets for 46 runs at The Oval, six of them coming in the space of 6.3 overs for seven runs. This would remain the best bowling performance of his first-class career, not surpassed, but he did equal it seven years later. In the following game, the last away match of the season, he took 10 Hampshire wickets for 150 runs in the match at Bournemouth. In the 1948 season as a whole, he took 91 wickets at an average of 28.07. As a tail-end left-handed batsman, he managed just 93 runs in the season at an average of 4.22.The emergence of Tony Lock as a slow left-arm bowler in 1949 brought a stuttering end of McMahon's Surrey career. Though he played in 12 first-class matches in the 1949 season, McMahon took only 19 wickets; a similar number of matches in 1950 brought 34 wickets. In 1951, he played just seven times and in 1952 only three times. In 1953, Lock split the first finger of his left hand, and played in only 11 of Surrey's County Championship matches; McMahon played as his deputy in 14 Championship matches, though a measure of their comparative merits was that Lock's 11 games produced 67 wickets at 12.38 runs apiece, while McMahon's 14 games brought him 45 wickets at the, for him, low average of 21.53. At the end of the 1953 season, McMahon was allowed to leave Surrey to join Somerset, then languishing at the foot of the County Championship and recruiting widely from other counties and other countries.\n\nSomerset cricketer\nSomerset's slow bowling in 1954 was in the hands of leg-spinner Johnny Lawrence, with support from the off-spin of Jim Hilton while promising off-spinner Brian Langford was on national service. McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly.\nMcMahon instantly became a first-team regular and played in almost every match during his four years with the county, not missing a single Championship game until he was controversially dropped from the side in August 1957, after which he did not play in the Championship again.In the 1954 season, McMahon, alongside fellow newcomer Hilton, was something of a disappointment, according to Wisden: \"The new spin bowlers, McMahon and Hilton, did not attain to the best standards of their craft in a wet summer, yet, like the rest of the attack, they would have fared better with reasonable support in the field and from their own batsmen,\" it said. McMahon took 85 wickets at an average of 27.47 (Hilton took only 42 at a higher average). His best match was against Essex at Weston-super-Mare where he took six for 96 in the first innings and five for 45 in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 141, which were the best of his career. He was awarded his county cap in the 1954 season, but Somerset remained at the bottom of the table.\nThe figures for the 1955 were similar: McMahon this time took 75 wickets at 28.77 apiece. There was a small improvement in his batting and the arrival of Bryan Lobb elevated McMahon to No 10 in the batting order for most of the season, and he responded with 262 runs and an average of 9.03. This included his highest-ever score, 24, made in the match against Sussex at Frome. A week later in Somerset's next match, he equalled his best-ever bowling performance, taking eight Kent wickets for 46 runs in the first innings of a match at Yeovil through what Wisden called \"clever variation of flight and spin\". These matches brought two victories for Somerset, but there were only two others in the 1955 season and the side finished at the bottom of the Championship for the fourth season running.At the end of the 1955 season, Lawrence retired and McMahon became Somerset's senior spin bowler for the 1956 season, with Langford returning from National Service as the main support. McMahon responded with his most successful season so far, taking 103 wickets at an average of 25.57, the only season in his career in which he exceeded 100 wickets. The bowling average improved still further in 1957 to 23.10 when McMahon took 86 wickets. But his season came to an abrupt end in mid-August 1957 when, after 108 consecutive Championship matches, he was dropped from the first team during the Weston-super-Mare festival. Though he played some games for the second eleven later in August, he regained his place in the first team for only a single end-of-season friendly match, and he was told that his services were not required for the future, a decision, said Wisden, that \"proved highly controversial\".\n\nSacked by Somerset\nThe reason behind McMahon's sacking did not become public knowledge for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as \"a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality\". It went on: \"Legend tells of a night at the Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the gladioli with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'\" The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by \"a POW-type loop\" organised by McMahon, \"with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again\". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right at the end of the 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been \"an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel\" earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.\nAfter a period in Lancashire League cricket with Milnrow Cricket Club, McMahon moved back to London where he did office work, later contributing some articles to cricket magazines.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\nPassage 9:\nHenry Moore (cricketer)\nHenry Walter Moore (1849 – 20 August 1916) was an English-born first-class cricketer who spent most of his life in New Zealand.\n\nLife and family\nHenry Moore was born in Cranbrook, Kent, in 1849. He was the son of the Reverend Edward Moore and Lady Harriet Janet Sarah Montagu-Scott, who was one of the daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch. One of his brothers, Arthur, became an admiral and was knighted. Their great \ngrandfather was John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1783 to 1805. One of their sisters was a maid of honour to Queen Victoria.Moore went to New Zealand in the 1870s and lived in Geraldine and Christchurch. He married Henrietta Lysaght of Hāwera in November 1879, and they had one son. In May 1884 she died a few days after giving birth to a daughter, who also died.In 1886 Moore became a Justice of the Peace in Geraldine. In 1897 he married Alice Fish of Geraldine. They moved to England four years before his death in 1916.\n\nCricket career\nMoore was a right-handed middle-order batsman. In consecutive seasons, 1876–77 and 1877–78, playing for Canterbury, he made the highest score in the short New Zealand first-class season: 76 and 75 respectively. His 76 came in his first match for Canterbury, against Otago. He went to the wicket early on the first day with the score at 7 for 2 and put on 99 for the third wicket with Charles Corfe before he was out with the score at 106 for 3 after a \"very fine exhibition of free hitting, combined with good defence\". Canterbury were all out for 133, but went on to win the match. His 75 came in the next season's match against Otago, when he took the score from 22 for 2 to 136 for 6. The New Zealand cricket historian Tom Reese said, \"Right from the beginning he smote the bowling hip and thigh, going out of his ground to indulge in some forceful driving.\" Canterbury won again.Moore led the batting averages in the Canterbury Cricket Association in 1877–78 with 379 runs at an average of 34.4. Also in 1877–78, he was a member of the Canterbury team that inflicted the only defeat on the touring Australians. In 1896–97, at the age of 47, he top-scored in each innings for a South Canterbury XVIII against the touring Queensland cricket team.\nPassage 10:\nHartley Lobban\nHartley W Lobban (9 May 1926 – 15 October 2004) was a Jamaican-born first-class cricketer who played 17 matches for Worcestershire in the early 1950s.\n\nLife and career\nLobban played little cricket in Jamaica. He went to England at the end of World War II as a member of the Royal Air Force, and settled in Kidderminster in Worcestershire in 1947, where he worked as a civilian lorry driver for the RAF. He began playing for Kidderminster Cricket Club in the Birmingham League, and at the start of the 1952 season, opening the bowling for the club's senior team, he had figures of 7 for 9 and 7 for 37.Worcestershire invited him to play for them, and he made his first-class debut against Sussex in July 1952. He took five wickets in the match (his maiden victim being Ken Suttle) and then held on for 4 not out with Peter Richardson (20 not out) to add the 12 runs needed for a one-wicket victory after his county had collapsed from 192 for 2 to 238 for 9. A week later he claimed four wickets against Warwickshire, then a few days later still he managed 6 for 52 (five of his victims bowled) in what was otherwise a disastrous innings defeat to Derbyshire. In the last match of the season he took a career-best 6 for 51 against Glamorgan; he and Reg Perks (4 for 59) bowled unchanged throughout the first innings. Worcestershire won the game and Lobban finished the season with 23 wickets at 23.69.He took 23 wickets again in 1953, but at a considerably worse average of 34.43, and had only two really successful games: against Oxford University in June, when he took 5 for 70, and then against Sussex in July. On this occasion Lobban claimed eight wickets, his most in a match, including 6 for 103 in the first innings. He also made his highest score with the bat, 18, but Sussex won by five wickets.In 1954 Lobban made only two first-class appearances, and managed only the single wicket of Gloucestershire tail-ender Bomber Wells. In his final game, against Warwickshire at Dudley, his nine first-innings overs cost 51. He bowled just two overs in the second innings as Warwickshire completed an easy ten-wicket win. Lobban played one more Second XI game, against Glamorgan II at Cardiff Arms Park; in this he picked up five wickets.\nHe was also a professional boxer and played rugby union for Kidderminster.He later moved to Canada, where he worked as a teacher in Burnaby, British Columbia.

He co-composed with Howard Talbot the successful Kitty Grey (1900).He continued to write songs and to receive recognition for them. The 1901 and 1902 BBC Promenade Concerts, \"The Proms\", included four of his compositions, namely Come back, sweet Love, The Mermaid, My Peggy and Private Donald.\nHis setting of My Ships, a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, was performed by Clara Butt and republished several times.

The setting of the story is transplanted from Stockholm to San Francisco. It was directed by Stuart Rosenberg and features Walter Matthau as Detective Jake Martin.\n\nPlot\nA busload of passengers, including off-duty police detective Dave Evans, are gunned down and killed. Evans, on his own time, has been following a man named Gus Niles in search of information linking businessman Henry Camarero to the murder of his wife, Teresa, two years earlier.\nEvans was the partner of Detective Sergeant Jake Martin, a veteran but cynical member of the Homicide Detail working the bus massacre investigation. Jake originally investigated the Teresa Camarero case and has been obsessed with his failure to \"make\" Camarero for the murder. Jake returns to it after many dead-end leads (including a disastrous confrontation with a deranged amputee who takes hostages at gunpoint) in the bus investigation. Niles was killed on the bus as well, and it was Niles who provided the alibi that enabled Camarero to cover up his wife's murder.\nThe sullen Jake and enthusiastic but impulsive Inspector Leo Larsen are paired to interview suspects. Jake shuts out Larsen from his deductions, while Larsen, despite a loose-on-the-rules and brutal side, tries to understand and gain the confidence of his new partner. Defying the orders of their police superior Lt. Steiner, they seek, find and then smoke out Camarero, leading to a chase through the streets of San Francisco and a confrontation aboard another bus.\n\nCast\nWalter Matthau as Sgt.

It provides the special delight we get from gradually unraveling a complicated case... The direction is by Stuart Rosenberg, and marks a comeback of sorts... With The Laughing Policeman, he takes a labyrinthine plot and leads us through it at a gallop; he respects our intelligence and doesn't bother to throw in a lot of scenes where everything is explained. All the pieces in the puzzle do fit together, you realize after the movie is over, and part of the fun is assembling them yourself. And there are a couple of scenes that are really stunning, like the bus shooting, and an emergency room operation, and scenes where the partners try to shake up street people to get a lead out of them. Police movies so often depend on sheer escapist action that it's fun to find a good one.\nVariety praised the film saying that \"After an extremely overdone prolog of violent mass murder on a bus, The Laughing Policeman becomes a handsomely made manhunt actioner, starring Walter Matthau and Bruce Dern in excellent performances as two San Francisco detectives\".According to Chris Petit of Time Out, \"By the end, complete with car chase and split-second shooting, the film has become indistinguishable from all those movies it's trying so hard to disown\".The Laughing Policeman was released on Blu-ray on November 15, 2016. Matthew Hartman of High-Def Digest, who reviewed it, wrote \"[the film] could have been a great and gritty 70s thriller, unfortunately, it's primary story doesn't live up to the potential of the opening scene\".\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1973\nPassage 4:\nPiero Schivazappa\nPiero Schivazappa (born  14 April 1935) is an Italian film and television director and screenwriter.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Colorno, Schivazappa entered the film industry in 1959 as an assistant director, collaborating with Valerio Zurlini, Mario Monicelli and  Carlo Lizzani, among others.

He was the second son of Cleombrotus I, and grandfather of Areus I, who succeeded him. Although he reigned for more than 60 years, his life is completely unknown, apart from a victory at the Pythian Games in 336 BC. Several theories have been suggested by modern historians to explain such inactivity, but none has gained consensus.\n\nLife and reign\nCleomenes was the second son of king Cleombrotus I (r. 380–371), who belonged to the Agiad dynasty, one of the two royal families of Sparta (the other being the Eurypontids). Cleombrotus died fighting Thebes at the famous Battle of Leuctra in 371. His eldest son Agesipolis II succeeded him, but he died soon after in 370. Cleomenes' reign was instead exceptionally long, lasting 60 years and 10 months according to Diodorus of Sicily, a historian of the 1st century BC. In a second statement, Diodorus nevertheless tells that Cleomenes II reigned 34 years, but he confused him with his namesake Cleomenes I (r. 524–490).\n\nDespite the outstanding length of his reign, very little can be said about Cleomenes. He has been described by modern historians as a \"nonentity\". Perhaps that the apparent weakness of Cleomenes inspired the negative opinion of the hereditary kingship at Sparta expressed by Aristotle in his Politics (written between 336 and 322). However, Cleomenes may have focused on internal politics within Sparta, because military duties were apparently given to the Eurypontid Agesilaus II (r. 400–c.360), Archidamus III (r. 360–338), and Agis III (r. 338–331). As the Spartans notably kept their policies secret from foreign eyes, it would explain the silence of ancient sources on Cleomenes. Another explanation is that his duties were assumed by his elder son Acrotatus, described as a military leader by Diodorus, who mentions him in the aftermath of the Battle of Megalopolis in 331, and again in 315.Cleomenes' only known deed was his chariot race victory at the Pythian Games in Delphi in 336. In the following autumn, he gave the small sum of 510 drachmas for the reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, which had been destroyed by an earthquake in 373. Cleomenes might have made this gift as a pretext to go to Delphi and engage in informal diplomacy with other Greek states, possibly to discuss the consequences of the recent assassination of the Macedonian king Philip II.One short witticism of Cleomenes regarding cockfighting is preserved in the Moralia, written by the philosopher Plutarch in the early 2nd century AD:\nSomebody promised to give to Cleomenes cocks that would die fighting, but he retorted, \"No, don't, but give me those that kill fighting.\"\nAs Acrotatus died before Cleomenes, the latter's grandson Areus I succeeded him while still very young, so Cleomenes' second son Cleonymus acted as regent until Areus' majority. Some modern scholars also give Cleomenes a daughter named Archidamia, who played an important role during Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese, but the age difference makes it unlikely.\nPassage 7:\nObata Toramori\nObata Toramori (小畠虎盛, 1491 – July 14, 1561) was Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku Period. He is known as one of the \"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\" \nHe also recorded as having been wounded 41 times in 36 encounters. \nHe was the father of Obata Masamori.\n\nSee also\nIsao Obata\nPassage 8:\nLars Eliasson\nLars Eliasson  (December 8, 1914 – June 5, 2002) was a Swedish politician.

The woman is Nargis who is revealed as a prostitute. He then falls in love. One night, Rajiv visits the \"bar\", and watches her (Nargis) dance.

Mockingly, Nargis refuses it but Rajiv says if she keeps disappearing like this, he will hang himself with the scarf. Nargis offers for a longer one in a jokingly way.\nRegardless, Rajiv wants to marry Nargis. Rajiv wants Nargis to be free from prostitution. Rajiv must now get past Zohra Baano. She owns a prostitution business and hires other women to do their dirty work, the only source of income. Zohra Baano wants a price in exchange and Rajiv is willing to do that. Slowly, Nargis begins to develop feelings for Rajiv. One night, Nargis escapes the brothel, Rajiv finds her and takes her to a hotel. Nargis realises this was a mistake so she must return to the brothel. As soon as the \"couple\" leave the hotel, 3 drunkards approach them and one of them recognizes Rajiv as \"Rocky\". In fact, this is his real name, although \"Rajiv\" denies it. Rajiv fights off the drunkards and realises that Nargis knows the truth. So he decides to come clean about his life story.\nRocky Desai (also Himesh Reshammiya), a singer, is on the aeroplane. An ardent boy, who's a fan of Rocky, and his granny wants an autograph so Rocky writes one for them. On the plane, an uneasy passenger heads for the restroom but he is a terrorist.

Babbar is a most-wanted terrorist. He vows revenge on Rocky. Avtaar recommends Rocky to change his identity and start afresh. And this is how Rocky becomes Rajiv.\nRajiv breaks Avtaar's oath by going back to UK. He's playing with his sister in the park until he receives a call. It is Avtaar who wants him to return to London (as a cover up) Babbar is targeting his sister. After the call, his sister is gone. The white woman who witnessed the event says a man just took her. Babbar then tells Rocky he's sister is dead. This shatters him completely.\nWhat follows is the underlying quest for true love. At the climax, Babbar captures Zohra Baano and Nargis.

At the end, they are married.\n\nCast\nHimesh Reshammiya as Rajiv Behl / Rocky Desai\nSara Loren as Nargis (Mona Lizza)\nAmrita Singh as Zohra Baano\nNatasha Sinha as Nargis (Mona Lizza)'s mother\nGaurav Chanana as Sadiq - Dead\nJaved Sheikh as Tariq Anwar\nGulshan Grover as Avtaar Singh\nAnupam Shyam as  Nawaz\nAdnan Shah as Babur Altaf Khan\nVeeru Krishnan\n\nRelease\nThe film was supposed to be released on 6 August 2010, along with Aisha, but due to clashes between director Pooja Bhatt and the producer, Bhushan Kumar, the release was delayed.

Upon arrival in Atlanta, Robinson and David Doe approached Dr. John S. Pemberton, a chemist and pharmacist, and struck a deal. In 1886 Frank Robinson officially settled in Atlanta where a new business was made called the Pemberton Chemical Company consisting of Robinson, Pemberton, David Doe and Pemberton's old partner, Ed Holland.\n\nCoca-Cola\nPemberton was experimenting with a medicinal formula which included coca leaves and kola nuts as sources of its ingredients. Robinson, who served as bookkeeper and partner to Pemberton, gave the syrup formula the name Coca-Cola, where Coca came from the coca leaves used and Cola for the kola nuts. The name Coca-Cola was also chosen \"because it was euphonious, and on account of my familiarity with such names as 'S.S.S; and 'B.B.B'\" said Robinson himself. He was also responsible for writing the Coca-Cola name in Spencerian script which was popular with bookkeepers of the era and remains one of the most recognized trademarks in the world. \nThe formula was introduced in May 1886 at the Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta. It sold 25 US gallons (95 L) the first year. The next year sales increased to 1,049 US gallons (3,970 L). In 1888 Pemberton sold the formula to Asa G. Candler, another Atlanta pharmacist and businessman, for a total investment of $2,300 before Pemberton died. Coca-Cola was granted a charter in 1892 and became the official Georgia Corporation named the Coca-Cola Company with Asa G. Candler, his brother John S. Candler, Frank M. Robinson and two other associates.  Robinson served as treasurer and secretary and changed the Coca-Cola syrup formula so as not to include any faint traces of cocaine by the time of the Pure Food and Drug Act initiated by the Federal Government in 1906. The starting capitalization for the company was at $100,000.Robinson overall was responsible for the early advertising of Coca-Cola before and after Candler bought the name and syrup formula from Pemberton, the first ads appearing in The Atlanta Journal in 1887. While still working with Pemberton, Robinson had the initial ads display short phrases such as \"Coca-Cola! Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating! The new and popular soda fountain drink containing the properties of the wonderful Coca plant and the famous Cola nut.\" Marketing for the drink showed the syrup beverage with medicinal properties curing headaches but with a unique taste. The initial ads distributed invited citizens to try \"the new and popular soda fountain drink.\" Hand painted oil cloth signs were put outside stores displaying the Coca-Cola brand name with catchy words such as \"Drink\" in order to inform customers and other people passing by about the new medicinal beverage that was also a soda fountain drink. First year sales showed an average of nine bottles sold per day.Robinson later retired in 1914, but remained one of the company's directors. In The Columbus Enquirer-Sun a newspaper founded in 1874, published an article in 1906 praising Robinson's work with Coca-Cola: \"there is one person to whom particular credit is due for the fact that the Coca-Cola formula remained, in the hands of the Georgians, and the further fact that the drink soon became so popular. He is Mr. Robinson, and the present secretary of the Coca-Cola Company...In developing the drink, Mr. Robinson has also developed. He is said to be one of the best posted experts on advertising in America today, all due to his experience in advertising and pushing Coca-Cola.\"\n\nPersonal life\nOriginally from Maine, as a young man he was in Iowa where he married Laura Clapp. Robinson had a home in Druid Hills, an early suburb of Atlanta. He also had a 40-acre (160,000 m2) country home on the Cobb County banks of the Chattahoochee River. The property had been a southern fortification defending the railroad bridge. The property is currently the Frank Mason Robinson Nature Preserve. He owned six residences which were occupied rent free by family and friends.\nRobinson taught a large Bible class at the First Christian Church of Atlanta. A large English stained glass window dedicated to his memory is above the pulpit of Peachtree Christian Church. He was a Republican in national politics but a Democrat in state and local politics.\nRobinson died in July 1923 and was buried in Atlanta's Westview Cemetery.\nPassage 4:\nDouglas Ivester\nDouglas Ivester (born 1947) is an American businessman.

Makavejev's most internationally successful film was the 1971 political satire W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism, which he both directed and wrote.\n\nCareer\nMakavejev's first three feature films, Man Is Not a Bird (1965, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Milena Dravić), Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator (1967, starring actress and icon of the \"Black Wave\" period in film, Eva Ras) and Innocence Unprotected (1968), all won him international acclaim. The last-mentioned won  the Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury at the 18th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1970 he was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1991 he was a member of the jury at the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.His 1971 movie W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism (starring Milena Dravić, Jagoda Kaloper, and Ivica Vidović) was banned in Yugoslavia due to its sexual and political content. He described authoritarian figures in the film as people who are not in control of themselves striving to control others. The political scandal surrounding Makavejev's film was symptomatic of an increasingly oppressive political climate in Yugoslavia that effectively ended the director's domestic career and resulted in his leaving Yugoslavia to live and work abroad in Europe and North America. Makavejev's next film, Sweet Movie (1974), was the first feature work that the director produced entirely outside of Yugoslavia (the film was made in Canada). The film's explicit depiction of sex together with its bold treatment of the more taboo dimensions of sexuality reduced the size of its audience (i.e. it was largely confined to the art house context) and also resulted in the film's being censored in several countries. Makavejev said: \"After Sweet Movie it was as if I had burned all my bridges. I just lost the chance to talk to producers.\"\nAfter a seven-year hiatus in feature film production, Makavejev released the comparatively more conventional black comedy entitled Montenegro (1981). The director's next feature film, The Coca-Cola Kid (1985), which was based on short stories by Frank Moorhouse and featured performances by Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi, is arguably his most accessible picture.\nMakavejev appears as one of the narrators in the 2007 Serbian documentary film Zabranjeni bez zabrane (Banned without being banned), which gives profound insight into the history and the nature of Yugoslav film censorship through its investigation of the country's distinctive political-cultural mechanisms for unofficially banning politically controversial films. The film contains original interviews with key filmmakers from the communist era.He published two books of selected articles: Poljubac za drugaricu parolu (1960) and 24 sličice u sekundi (1965).\n\nViews\nIn 1993 Makavejev wrote and appeared in a half hour televised Opinions lecture in Britain, produced by Open Media for Channel 4 and subsequently published in The Times. Makavejev speaks of himself as a citizen of the world but \"of the leftovers of Yugoslavia too\". He cites Jacques Tourneur's Hollywood horror classic Cat People as one of the rare films in the history of the cinema that mention Serbs, \"a people from an obscure region who were haunted by evil; when hurt they turn into ferocious cats, like panthers, and killed those whom they thought to be the source of hurt of rejection\". He comments on the division of Bosnia on ethnic lines:\n\n\"Creators of nationalist myths, both Serbs and Croats, came from the same mountainous region that was probably the source of this Hollywood story. Before the armed conflict, these people were whipping up nationalist fever and indoctrination until conflict became inevitable and both nations were trapped in a bloody embrace...How long will it take for an ethnically \"clean\" state for every single person who miraculously stays alive? A state for each family, a state for the father in case he is a Croat, a state for the mother in case she is a Muslim, a state for the daughter in case she is a Yugoslav, a state for the son in case he is a Serb, a specific flag for the dog, a currency for the cat.\"\n\nFilmography\nFeature films\n\nShort films\n\nJatgan mala (1953)\nPečat (1955)\nAntonijevo razbijeno ogledalo (1957)\nSpomenicima ne treba verovati (1958)\nOsmjeh '61 (1961)\nEci peci pec (1961)\nParada (1962)\nNova domaća životinja (1964)\nPassage 10:\nK.

The provincial Progressive Conservative government purchased the land from Wilson in 1971, giving him an 81% profit, which resulted in complaints by the parliamentary opposition and a formal inquiry which found no wrongdoing on the part of Willis but which criticized the government for not bargaining for a lower price.Willis died in flight from Ottawa to Toronto.\nPassage 8:\nCharalampos Mavrias\nCharalampos Mavrias (Greek: Χαράλαμπος Μαυρίας; born 21 February 1994), known as \"Charis\" (Greek: Χάρης) or \"Harry\", is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a right back and right midfielder for Greece national team.\n\nClub career\nPanathinaikos\nMavrias joined Panathinaikos' youth academy in 2007, aged 13, and was promoted to the first-team squad in 2010, after signing a professional contract in the previous year. On 20 October 2010 he made his first-team – and UEFA Champions League – debut, playing the last 12 minutes of a 0–0 home draw against Rubin Kazan, thus becoming the youngest Greek ever to appear in the competition, and the second youngest overall (only behind Celestine Babayaro, being surpassed later by Alen Halilović, Youri Tielemans and Rayan Cherki). Four days later he made his league debut, again as a substitute in a 0–1 loss at AEK.\nMavrias scored his first professional goal on 18 February 2012, netting his side's last of a 2–0 success at Ergotellis; he scored his first European goal on 31 July 2012, again netted the last of a 2–0 win at Motherwell in the first leg of the third qualifying round of the Champions League, one minute after coming onto the pitch as a substitute.\n\nSunderland\nOn 22 August 2013, Mavrias joined English Premier League side Sunderland on a four-year contract, for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be £2-3 million. However, he was left out of the squad to play Southampton due to lack of match fitness.\nMavrias made his debut five days later, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 4–2 home success over Milton Keynes Dons, for the campaign's Football League Cup. He scored his first goal on 25 January of the following year, netting the winner against Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup.On 2 February 2015, it was confirmed Mavrias had joined his former club Panathinaikos on loan until the end of the 2014–15 season.\nMavrias returned to Sunderland where he has been training and playing for the Black Cats Under-21s – and is understood to have impressed the club's coaching staff with his attitude and contribution. But Mavrias has not come close to being included in the first-team squad, however is not bitter over seeing his career stall on Wearside. “I took the decision to leave Panathinaikos and go to Sunderland, and I think anyone in my position would take this decision,” he told the Greek press. On 9 January 2016, almost two years after his last match with the first team, Mavrias entered the game in second half as a substitute in a 3–1 away loss against Arsenal for FA Cup.\n\nFortuna Düsseldorf\nHe was loaned to Fortuna Düsseldorf on 27 January 2016.\nMavrias - who has 18 months remaining on his Sunderland contract - now has a chance to play regular first-team football after joining Düsseldorf until the end of the campaign, with a view to a permanent switch next summer. On 6 February 2016, he made his debut with a club, in a 0–1 home loss against Heidenheim.\nMavrias performance in Düsseldorf was satisfying, leading the club to set an offer for the Greek international winger. Unfortunately on 24 June 2016, Sunderland reject Fortuna Düsseldorf's lower bid than the £400,000 clause to convert the loan into a permanent switch.\n\nKarlsruher SC\nOn 6 September 2016, after three seasons spent playing for Sunderland, only 7 official caps overall collected as a Black Cats man, plus 2 experiences as a loanee (at Fortuna Düsseldorf and Panathinaikos), he joined 2. Bundesliga side Karlsruher SC for a three-years contract. On 10 September 2016, he made his debut with the club in a 4–0 away loss against Union Berlin. Unfortunately, KSC harboured hopes of promotion back to the Bundesliga this summer, after finishing seventh last term had erupted during the year as the club relegated to Germany's third tier.\n\nRijeka\nOn 24 August 2017, Mavrias joined Rijeka in the Croatian First Football League on a one-year contract with a three-year extension option.\n\nHibernian\nMavrias signed with Scottish Premiership club Hibernian in October 2018 on a short-term contract, following a trial period. He made two first-team appearances for Hibernian, but then suffered a hamstring injury and was released at the end of his contract.\n\nOmonia\nOn 29 December 2018, Omonia officially announced the signing of Mavrias on a 2,5 year contract. He made his debut for the team on 13 January 2019, on a match against Apollon Limassol for the Cypriot First Division, replacing Saša Živec on the 41st minute. On February 10, he scored his first goal on a match against Doxa Katokopias.\n\nApollon Limassol\nOn 11 June 2021, Apollon Limassol announced him, with a contract lasting until 2023.\n\nInternational career\nOn 19 March 2019, Greece head coach Angelos Anastasiadis announced the call up of Mavrias for the match against Liechtenstein and Bosnia and Herzegovina for UEFA Euro 2020. Mavrias's talent is undoubted and has added versatility to his game, demonstrating he is able to operate as a right back if need be. His form in Cyprus has been patchy which again makes his selection fascinating. Anastasiadis may see him as a ‘wildcard’ option to throw on off the bench as his speed could add another dimension to a team severely lacking such a trait. He has already featured for the Greece national team on five occasions, but his last appearance came in 2014 as the Greece lost to Serbia in a friendly.\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of 22:01, 08 May 2022 (UTC).\n\nHonours\nClub\nRijeka\n\nAtlantic Cup: 2017Omonia\n\nCypriot First Division: 2020–21Apollon Limassol\n\nCypriot First Division: 2021–22\n\nInternational\nGreece U19\n\nUEFA European Under-19 Championship runner-up: 2012\nPassage 9:\nJohn J.

At age 16 he was working as a painter for his father, but then established himself as a magician, daredevil, and escapologist, sometimes with the spelling Harry Herd, as \"The world’s youngest Handcuff King,\" an English version of Harry Houdini, although it's uncertain whether he met Houdini or saw him perform.\n\nActing career\nHeard began his film career in 1912 and used the name Harry Lorraine throughout his acting career. It appears to have been strictly a stage name, as he used the surname Heard on his marriage certificate in 1932, and there is no known documentation of a legal name change.Lorraine's first acting role was Little John in Robin Hood Outlawed. The next month, he took the lead role of Lieutenant Rose in Lieutenant Rose and the Train Wreckers. In this movie, typical for the time period, Lorraine's character is traveling on a train which has been directed to a siding by the enemy, and – all while the smallest slip means certain death – as the train is hurtling along, he climbs out of the carriage, swings himself between two coaches, and disconnects the couplings, thereby saving the day by sending on the bulk of the train to destruction while his own carriage remains safely on the track.Lorraine did his own stunts in movies, drawing on his natural strength and the physical skills he had developed prior to acting. During a time when it seemed audiences wanted more and every action movie had to outdo previous movies – and with only visual effects and music – some were quite challenging and even dangerous. Examples of some of the daredevil stunts Lorraine performed include diving into a pool of sharks (filming on location in Jamaica), being thrown bound hand and foot from Walton Bridge into the river thirty feet below, fighting six men single-handedly and getting thrown down onto a table with such force that it splintered (this was an unrehearsed and unexpected thrill), jumping from an airplane, dangling from the jib of a very tall crane while bound, being dragged by a taxicab, and sundry chase scenes.Lorraine's acting career spanned three decades, and its end probably had as much to do with the near-standstill of the British film industry during World War II as with his advancing age for the types of characters he usually played.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1932, Lorraine married Gladys Seals in Kingston. His name was recorded as Harry Heard on the marriage certificate. He was forty-five years old and his occupation was listed as film director; she was twenty-four. Gladys used the name Tonie throughout her life. They had two boys, both born in Staines, whose surnames were registered as both Heard and Lorraine, and adopted to use the surname Lorraine.The British film industry was decimated by the effects of World War II, and after the war Lorraine left acting to manage his father’s building business. Known as Lorraine Estates, it was initially involved in repairing bomb damage to property in Battersea and other sites in and around London. Lorraine continued working in the building business almost until his death at age 85 on 27 March 1970, and was recorded as \"film director (retired)\" on his death certificate. Tonie died in 2002, at age 94.\n\nSelected filmography\nNotes\nCopies of some of Lorraine's movies are no longer extant, and there are only brief synopses for some. For others, even story lines and listing of credits are not available.\nDuring Lorraine's career, there was another actor name Harry Lorraine, an American silent film actor who was noted for comedy and romance films, not action films. Their careers largely overlapped, and due to incomplete records and because the English Harry Lorraine spent time and is thought to filmed movies in the United States, their filmographies have not yet been disambiguated with certainty.", "answers": ["Harry Albert Willis"], "length": 2990, "dataset": "2wikimqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "fbbe6a3e39955eca34caa6cf37d147f6af697a70eb83a30c"}
{"input": "Which film came out earlier, Olavina Udugore or A Pearl In The Forest?", "context": "Passage 1:\nWorskla Forest\nThe Worskla Forest (на Ворскле) is in the Belgorod Oblast of Russia. It is part of the (Sapowednik) Belogorye Nature Reserve.\nIt lies on the high right side of the Worskla river, between the Worskla and the Gotnja rivers. It covers an area of 1,038 hectares (2,560 acres). Geographically the area belongs to the southern part of the forest-steppe zone. The nature reserve is bordered to the north-west by the village of Krasny Kutok, to the southeast by Borisovka, and in the north and the south and west by the Worsklatal. On the left bank of the Vorskla, is the village of Dubino (Landsgemeinde Belenkoje). The territory of the forest itself is part of the rural community Kryukovo.\n\nGeography\nThe western, northwestern and southern edges form the river terraces and slopes of Woskla and Loknjatal Rivers. The highest point in the forest at 217 metres (712 ft) is located in the northeastern part of the forest. The lowest point (137 metres (449 ft)) is located in Worsklatal. Through the forest run numerous small gullies that are called in this region \"Jar\".\nIn the forest there are no springs and watercourses although the forest is quite wet at the beginning of spring, after the snow melts, flowing rivulets at the bottom of canyons. The rivers Vorskla, Gotnja and Loknja flow along the forest edge for a distance of 10 to 900 metres (33 to 2,953 ft).\nOn the territory of the forest there is no natural pond. Only in the protection zone of the nature reserve, in the Worsklatalaue, there are small backwaters. In the 20th century, ponds were built in the Klosterrunse whose dams broke through snow meltwater. Only a pond remained at the top of the gully.\n\nSoils\nThe soils of the forest at the Vorskla developed on different parent materials, especially on the loam, which is found in the eastern half of the forest. In the northwestern part of the forest, old alluvium sands play a role. They are distributed on the river terraces of Gotnja and Loknja. At the southern and south-eastern edge of the forest an oligozänischer sandy loam is common parent rock. In some places in the southern part of the forest, a rust-colored clay comes out. The oligozänische sandy loam and the rust-colored clay are the starting materials of soil formation, where erosion has removed the loess. Under the oligozänischen clay are rocks from the Cretaceous, which do not appear on the surface in the territory of the forest.\nHere 20 different soil types are distinguished. They differ on the degree of podsolisation and the humus content. All floors of the Forest on the Vorskla are based on the Russian soil classification from 1977 about the types of gray forest soils.  According to the USDA soil classification they belong to the Alfi sols, after the German soil classification if they were classified as Luvisols.\n\nHistory\nUntil the 17th century, the Worskla forest was a part of an undivided oak forest that stretched along the high right bank of the Vorskla River. Forest was used as a natural barrier against depredations of the Tartars. Therefore, logging of the woods was strictly forbidden. At the end of the 17th century, however, the Tartar threat had diminished.\n\nIn the Early 18th century the forest was protected from being cut down by regulations of Peter I. In 1701, the deforestation along the rivers was banned, then in 1703, the ban was extended to the small rivers. The edict included a ban on grazing and oaks, pines, maples and elms with trunk thicknesses of more than 54 centimetres (21 in) were excluded from felling.In 1705 the forest was owned by Count Boris Sheremetev who created a conservation area and hunting reserve. In 1714 Count Sheremetev founded a nunnery in Borisovka on the edge of the forest, today it is a nature reserve.\nIn the 1880s and 1890s the first major deforestation in the fourth section of the forest and in the northern part of the tenth section the deforestation continued into the 20th century.After the October Revolution, the forest on the Vorskla was in danger with felling beginning in 1917, with grazing and vegetable gardens being introduced. Larger native animals almost disappeared.\nIt fell to the entomologist Malyshev to begin a movement to save the forest. He knew the forest at the Vorskla from the time before the revolution when as a student he undertook entomological research there. In 1919 he wrote appeals to various authorities. He also appeared in the People's Assembly of the residents of Borisovka and made propaganda work for forest conservation in schools and village libraries. His efforts were successful, and after the establishment of Zoopsychologischen Station (in 1922) the forest was made a nature reserve in 1924.  Malyshev organized the protection of forests. In the nature reserve began scientific research, the nature reserve, the Natural History Museum was founded. In Russian and Germany  scientific journals first article on the forest at the Vorskla were published. However, Malyshev was subject to a political witch-hunt under Joseph Stalin and he was dismissed from his role at the Nature Reserve and in 1934, Malyshev was transported to Leningrad.\nIn 1934 the forest was transferred to control of Leningrad University. During World War II, the forest fell under German occupation who felled tens of thousands of trees. During the Battle of Kursk, trenches were laid out in the forest, causing soil erosion, which can be seen to this day.In 1994, the Nature Reserve of the University of St. Petersburg was handed over to the Ministry of Natural Resources. Today an area of 160 hectares (400 acres), is the only forest with 300-year-old oak trees to have survived in the European part of the former Soviet Union.\n\nGallery\nPassage 2:\nPearl Airways\nPearl Airways or Pearl Airways Compagne Haitienne was an airline based in Haiti.\nPassage 3:\nOlavina Udugore\nOlavina Udugore is a 1987 Indian Kannada-language film directed, written and co-produced by D.

The script is based on the true story of the Battle of Kolwezi that happened in 1978. It was diligently described in a book of the same name by former 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment Captain Pierre Sergent. He published his book in 1979, and the film came out in 1980. Coutard shot the film in a documentary style.\n\nPlot\nThe film is based on true events. In 1978, approximately 3,000 heavily armed fighters from Katanga crossed the border to the Zaire and marched into Kolwezi, a mining centre for copper and cobalt. They took 3,000 civilians as hostages. Within a few days, between 90 and 280 hostages were killed. The rebels appeared to be unpredictable and are reported to have threatened to annihilate all civilians.\nMobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's head of state, urged Belgium, France and the United States to help. France sent the Foreign Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, which were flown from Corsica to Kolwezi. Following their arrival, they secured the perimeter, in co-operation with Belgian soldiers from Zaire, and then started to evacuate the civilians. Within two days more than 2,000 Europeans and about 3,000 African citizens were saved. The film strives to depict the events in a dramatised form, concentrating on the Europeans' plight.\n\nProduction\nThe late Jean Seberg had filmed scenes on location for the film, but her death caused her to be replaced by another French American actress, Mimsy Farmer, who reshot Seberg's scenes.\n\nCast\nBruno Cremer: Pierre Delbart\nJacques Perrin:Ambassador Berthier\nLaurent Malet: Phillipe Denrémont\nPierre Vaneck: Colonel Grasser\nMimsy Farmer: Annie Devrindt\nGiuliano Gemma: Adjudant Fédérico\nRobert Etcheverry : Colonel Dubourg\nJean-Claude Bouillon : Maurois\nPassage 5:\nA Pearl in the Forest\nA Pearl in the Forest (Mongolian: Мойлхон, Moilkhon, Buckthorn) is a 2008 Mongolian historical film.This is a story about a young couple whose newly planned life was destroyed by the impact of the Great Purge of 1934–1938 in Mongolia.\nThe main goal of this movie was to provide a testimony for the many Buryats and Mongolians who were persecuted during the Great Purges initiated by Joseph Stalin. In 1937 and 1938, many people, and even entire families, were killed after being wrongfully accused of conspiracies.\nThe movie was shot on location near the Buryat village of Dadal in the Khentii province of Mongolia. The acting and other participation of many local villagers was a great addition to the authenticity of the film.\n\nSynopsis\nIn the 1930s in Mongolia, a former villager returns as a government informer, and is determined to use his authority to crush a village in order to take by force what he cannot win by love: a young woman who is engaged to another man.\n\nCast\nBayarmaa Baatar : Sendem\nZolboot Gombo : Markhaa\nNarankhuu Khatanbaatar : Dugar\nG.

The forest is around Mount Cole, which formed 390 million years ago. The Indigenous Australians, the Beeripmo balug people, called it Bereep-bereep, which means wild. The forest covers an area of 12,150 hectares, including the forest around Mount Lonarch.The forest is on a plateau which is above grassy plains. The plateau is about 760 metres above sea level. High peaks in the forest include Mount Buangor (1,090 metres), Mount Cole (899 metres) and Ben Nevis (877 metres).The main trees in the southern part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), and Blue Gums (Eucalyptus globulus). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).There have been 130 different birds seen in the forest, including the Powerful owl (Ninox strenua). Animals include kangaroos, wallabies, echidna, koalas and possums. In 1954, 160 koalas were set free in the forest to as part of a plan to re-establish the animals in Victorian forests. In the 19th century, deer were introduced and Sambar deer are still living in the wet gullies in the south of the forest.\nActivities in the forest include camping, walking, four wheel driving, horse riding, and bird watching.The purpose of the forest is to supply good quality hardwood logs for sawmills. The management plan for the forest also protects the water catchments of several creeks which supply water to nearby towns.\nOn 24 June 2021, the Andrews State Government, following an extensive review and recommendation, declerated that the Mt Cole State Forest would be added to the National Park register, providing it with additional protections. The proposed Mt Buangor National Park would be staged over the next 8 years in addition to 60,000 hectares of State forests and parks also to be added.\n\nMount Buangor State Park\nAn area of 1,940 hectares, the Mount Buangor State Park, was protected from logging in 1973. This park includes the waterfalls on Middle Creek, and the large rock faces and caves on Cave Hill.\n\nClimate\nAs the ranges face into the prevailing westerly storm track, maximum temperatures are particularly cold for the altitude and latitude. Heavy snowfalls occur regularly throughout the year, and sub-freezing daily maximum temperatures have been recorded well into spring at Lookout Hill (965 metres). Cold weather is present even at the height of summer: on 02 February 2005, the daily maximum temperature did not exceed 4.5 °C (40.1 °F) at Lookout Hill. The ranges can be classed as having a cool mediterranean climate.

It was one of the singles from the soundtrack album for the film Rugrats in Paris: The Movie (known in France as Les Razmokets à Paris). With its lyrics written by Farmer and the song being composed and produced by her long-time songwriting collaborator Laurent Boutonnat, \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" was released on 27 February 2001. The song describes the fairy Mélusine with \"childish\" lyrics that contrast with double entendres and puns referring to sexual practices. Although the single had no music video nor airplay promotion, it received generally positive reviews from critics and reached top-ten charts in France and Belgium.\n\nBackground and writing\nRugrats in Paris: The Movie was the second in a trilogy of films based on the children's animated television series Rugrats, which features the adventures of a group of toddlers. After filming, the producers wanted to record a soundtrack for the movie with mainly French songs, as well as a few in English. Several singers were contacted, including TLC member Tionne Watkins, the 1990s boys band 2Be3, Sinéad O'Connor, Cyndi Lauper and Mylène Farmer. Persistent but unconfirmed rumours claimed that Madonna, as the founder of the Maverick company producing the soundtrack, had expressly asked Farmer to participate in the album. Farmer accepted, but preferred to produce a new song instead of licensing the rights to one of her old compositions. The recording label Maverick signed a contract for an unreleased song, with lyrics written by Farmer and music composed by her songwriting partner Laurent Boutonnat. This was the first time that the singer had recorded a song especially for a movie. An English version was canceled in favour of a French version, and eventually the song only played for about 15 seconds in the movie. The first title chosen, \"Attrapez-moi\", was also quickly abandoned as it was too similar to the Pokémon's cry of \"Attrapez-les tous\".\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" is a synthpop song. It tells the story of a mischievous and malicious fairy, Mélusine, here embodied by Farmer. Lyrically, the song uses words referring to magic, baffling several of Farmer's fans as the lyrics seem to be closer to the themes found in songs by young singers such as Alizée. The lyrics also contain several double entendres and puns which refer to sexual practices. The song's title itself is ambiguous and can be deemed sexually suggestive as it contains a pun in French alluding to spanking: in French, the title \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" could be phonetically understand as meaning \"L'Histoire d'une fessée...\" (translation: \"The Story of a Spanking\").\n\nRelease\nIn Europe the soundtrack release was postponed until 7 February 2001 because Farmer had bought the song's royalties and finally decided to release it as a single, 14 days later. It was only released as a digipack CD single, in which the song's lyrics are written inside, and there was no promotional format. For the second time in the singer's career – after the song \"XXL\" – the single cover does not show her, but a drawing of a fairy from the film by Tom Madrid. The song began circulating online a month before the soundtrack's release and was well received by many fans who felt that it could be a hit. The song did not receive much radio airplay, with only Europe 2 playing it regularly. \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" was also released on the soundtrack of the film in a longer version than the CD single version, and was later included on Mylène Farmer's greatest hits album Les Mots. It was also released as the third track on the European CD maxi \"Les Mots\", released in the Switzerland on 4 September 2002.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was generally well received by critics, who particularly noted the puns. According to author Erwan Chuberre, the lyrics are \"as funny as disillusioned\" and Farmer uses puns that \"highlight her immoderate pleasure for impolite pleasures\", with a music he deemed \"effective\". Author Thierry Desaules said that the song appears to be a childish fairly tale, but is actually structured in a perverse enough way to address the adult public, as the allusions to the spanking can be seen as references to sadomasochism. Journalist Benoît Cachin wrote that her puns are \"of the funniest\" and that the singer included in the lyrics \"some very personal thoughts\", including sadness; he added that Farmer appears to be \"fun, dynamic and delightfully mischievous\" on this song.\n\nChart performance\nOn 3 March 2001, the single debuted at a peak of number nine on the French SNEP Singles Chart, providing Farmer her 22nd top ten hit. In the following weeks, the song fell steadily and remained in the top 50 for nine weeks and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. This chart performance was surprising given that the song was aired little on radio, the film met a mixed commercial success in France and there was no music video, no promotion on television, and only one format. According to Instant-Mag the beauty of the single's cover undoubtedly helped increase sales. In Belgium, the single started at number 23 on 15 March 2001, climbed to number 11, then peaked at number 10. Thereafter, it dropped and fell off the Ultratop 50 after 13 weeks. On the 2001 Belgian singles year-end chart, \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\" ranked at number 89.\n\nFormats and track listings\nThese are the formats and track listings of single releases of \"L'Histoire d'une fée, c'est...\":\n\nCD single – Digipack\n\nOfficial versions\nCredits and personnel\nThese are the credits and the personnel as they appear on the back of the single:\n\nMylène Farmer – lyrics\nLaurent Boutonnat – music, producer\nJohn Eng – artistic director\nGena Kornyshev – stylist\nTom Madrid – drawings\nRequiem Publishing – editions\nPolydor – recording company\nHenry Neu – design\nBertrand Chatenet – mixing\n\nCharts\nRelease history\nPassage 7:\nI Can Change (LCD Soundsystem song)\n\"I Can Change\" is a song by American rock band LCD Soundsystem.

Mathur was the Director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau between September 1975 and February 1980. He was also the Director General of Police in Punjab.\nPassage 2:\nSweepstakes (film)\nSweepstakes is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Albert S. Rogell from a screenplay written by Lew Lipton and Ralph Murphy. The film stars Eddie Quillan, James Gleason, Marian Nixon,  Lew Cody, and Paul Hurst, which centers around the travails and romances of jockey Buddy Doyle, known as the \"Whoop-te-doo Kid\" for his trademark yell during races. Produced by the newly formed RKO Pathé Pictures, this was the first film Charles R. Rogers would produce for the studio, after he replaced William LeBaron as head of production. The film was released on July 10, 1931, through RKO Radio Pictures.\n\nPlot\nBud Doyle is a jockey who has discovered the secret to get his favorite mount, Six-Shooter, to boost his performance. If he simply chants the phrase, \"Whoop-te-doo\", the horse responds with a burst of speed. There is a special bond between the jockey and his mount, but there is increasing tension between Doyle and the horse's owner, Pop Blake (who also raised Doyle), over Doyle's relationship with local singer Babe Ellis. Blake sees Ellis as a distraction prior to the upcoming big race, the Camden Stakes.\nThe owner of the club where Babe sings, Wally Weber, has his eyes on his horse winning the Camden Stakes. When the issues between Pop and Doyle come to a head, Pop tells Doyle that he has to choose: either he stops seeing Babe, or he'll be replaced as Six-Shooter's jockey in the big race. Angry and frustrated, Doyle quits. Weber approaches him to become the jockey for Rose Dawn, Weber's horse, and Doyle agrees, with the precondition that he not ride Royal Dawn in the Camden Stakes, for he wants Six-Shooter to still win the race.  Weber accedes to that one precondition, however, on the day of the race, he makes it clear that Doyle is under contract, and that he will ride Rose Dawn in the race.\nUpset, Doyle has no choice but to ride Rose Dawn.  However, during the race, he manages to chant his signature \"Whoop-te-doo\" to Six-Shooter, causing his old mount to win the race. Furious that his horse lost, Weber goes to the judges, who rule that Doyle threw the race, pulling back on Rose Dawn, to allow Six-Shooter to win, and suspend Doyle from horse-racing.\nDevastated, Doyle wanders from town to town, riding in small local races, until his identity is uncovered, and he is forced to move on.  Soon, he is out of racing all together, and forced to taking one odd-job after another.  Eventually, he ends up south of the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, working as a waiter. Doyle's friend, Sleepy Jones, hears of Doyle's plight. Jones gets the racing commission to lift the ban, by proving Doyle's innocence.  He then, accompanied by Babe, gets a group to buy Six-Shooter from Pop, and they take the horse down to Tijuana, where there is another big race in the near future, the Tijuana Handicap.\nDoyle is reluctant to ride at first, however, he is eventually cajoled into it by Sleepy and Babe, and of course, his bond with Six-Shooter is there.  He rides the horse to victory, re-establishing his credentials as a rider. The film ends by jumping a few years into the future, which shows Doyle and Babe happily married, with a child of their own.\n\nCast\n(Cast list as per AFI database)\nEddie Quillan as Bud Doyle\nLew Cody as Wally Weber\nJames Gleason as Sleepy Jones\nMarian Nixon as Babe Ellis\nKing Baggot as Mike\nPaul Hurst as Cantina Bartender\nClarence Wilson as Mr. Emory\nFrederick Burton as Pop Blake\nBilly Sullivan as Speed Martin\nLillian Leighton as Ma Clancy\nMike Donlin as The Dude\n\nProduction\nCritical response\nMordaunt Hall of The New York Times gave a very non-committal review of this film, with neither much praise or criticism.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system.

He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so.

In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions.

(French: Mais où est donc passée la septième compagnie?) is a 1973 French-Italian comedy war film directed by Robert Lamoureux. The film portrays the adventures of a French Army squad lost somewhere on the front in May 1940 during the Battle of France.\n\nPlot\nDuring the Battle of France, while German forces are spreading across the country, the 7th Transmission Company suffers an air raid near the Machecoul woods, but survive and hide in the woods. Captain Dumont, the company commander, sends Louis Chaudard, Pithiviers and Tassin to scout the area. After burying the radio cable beneath a sandy road, the squad crosses the field, climbs a nearby hill, and takes position within a cemetery. One man cut down the wrong tree for camouflage, pulling up the radio cable and revealing it to the passing German infantry. The Germans cut the cable, surround the woods, and order a puzzled 7th Company to surrender. The squad tries to contact the company, but then witness their capture and run away.\nCommanded by Staff Sergeant Chaudard, the unit stops in a wood for the night. Pithiviers is content to slow down and wait for the end of the campaign. The next day, he goes for a swim in the lake, in sight of possible German fighters. When Chaudard and Tassin wake up, they leave the camp without their weapons to look for Pithiviers. Tassin finds him and gives an angry warning, but Pithiviers convinces Tassin to join him in the lake. Chaudard orders them to get out, but distracted by a rabbit, falls into the lake. While Chaudard teaches his men how to swim, two German fighter planes appear, forcing them out of the water. After shooting down one of the German planes, a French pilot, Lieutenant Duvauchel, makes an emergency landing and escapes before his plane explodes. PFC Pithiviers, seeing the bad shape of one of his shoes, destroys what is left of his shoe sole. Tassin is sent on patrol to get food and a new pair of shoes for Pithiviers. Tassin arrives in a farm, but only finds a dog, so he returns and Chaudard goes to the farm after nightfall. The farmer returns with her daughter-in-law and Lt Duvauchel, and she welcomes Chaudard. Duvauchel, who is hiding behind the door, comes out upon hearing the news and decides to meet Chaudard's men.\nWhen Chaudard and Duvauchel return to the camp, Tassin and Pithiviers are roasting a rabbit they caught. Duvauchel realizes that Chaudard has been lying and takes command.\nThe following day, the men leave the wood in early morning and capture a German armored tow truck after killing its two drivers. They originally planned to abandon the truck and the two dead Germans in the woods, but instead realized that the truck is the best way to disguise themselves and free the 7th Company. They put on the Germans' uniforms, recover another soldier of the 7th Company, who succeeded in escaping, and obtain resources from a collaborator who mistook them for Germans.\nOn their way, they encounter a National Gendarmerie patrol, who appear to be a 5th column. The patrol injures the newest member of their group, a young soldier, and then are killed by Tassin.

He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of Tübingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of Tübingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of Württemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, Sénéchal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of Tübingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of Tübingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).

He was an innovative composer of instrumental music as well as songs, and was the composer of the earliest surviving music for the guitar.\n\nBiography\nThe place of his birth is not recorded, but he grew up in Guadalajara, and probably received his musical training there.  He most likely went to Italy in 1529 with Charles V, in the company of the fourth Duke of the Infantado, Íñigo López de Mendoza, marqués de Santillana.  When he returned to Spain he became a priest, receiving the post of canon at the cathedral in Seville in 1546, where he remained for the rest of his life.  While at the cathedral, he directed all of the musical activities; many records remain of his musical activities there, which included hiring instrumentalists, buying and assembling a new organ, and working closely with composer Francisco Guerrero for various festivities.  Mudarra died in Seville, and his sizable fortune was distributed to the poor of the city according to his will.\n\nMudarra wrote numerous pieces for the vihuela and the four-course guitar, all contained in the collection Tres libros de musica en cifras para vihuela (\"Three books of music in numbers for vihuela\"), which he published on December 7, 1546 in Seville.  These three books contain the first music ever published for the four-course guitar, which was then a relatively new instrument. The second book is noteworthy in that it contains eight multi-movement works, all arranged by \"tono\", or mode.\nCompositions represented in this publication include fantasias, variations (including a set on La Folia), tientos, pavanes and galliards, and songs. Modern listeners are probably most familiar with his Fantasia X, which has been a concert and recording mainstay for many years.   The songs are in Latin, Spanish and Italian, and include romances, canciones (songs), villancicos, (popular songs) and sonetos (sonnets).  Another innovation was the use of different signs for different tempos:  slow, medium, and fast.\n\nReferences and further reading\nJohn Griffiths: \"Alonso Mudarra\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

A pioneer of rock and roll, Jones played rhythm guitar in Bo Diddley's band in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming one of the first (perhaps the first) female rock guitarists in a highly visible rock band, and was sometimes called the Queen Mother of Guitar.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Harlem, New York City, in 1940, Jones grew up in the Sugar Hill section, and attended the High School of Performing Arts where she studied tap and ballet dance and trained in opera. Even from a very young age, she found herself completely consumed with music; purchasing her first guitar at the age of 15. She was briefly in a local doo-wop group, the Bop Chords, which disbanded in 1957.  A chance meeting with Bo Diddley, who was impressed to see a girl with a guitar case, led to an invitation to join Diddley's band as a guitarist and singer.  She recorded with him from 1957 to 1961 or 1963, appearing on singles including \"Hey! Bo Diddley\", \"Road Runner\", \"Bo Diddley's A Gunslinger\", and the instrumental \"Aztec\" which she wrote and played all the guitar parts. However, throughout her career, Peggy Jones always strived to be an independent artist and was involved in an R&B band known as the Jewels, among other various names.Throughout her time with Diddley, Jones maintained the separate career she had begun independently as a songwriter, session musician, and bandleader.  She led her own band, the Jewels (also known as the Fabulous Jewels, Lady Bo and the Family Jewels, and various other names, but not to be confused with The Jewels), which became a top R&B band on the New York – Boston east coast club scene the 1960s and 1970s.  She eventually left Diddley's band to concentrate on the Jewels and other activities.  She was replaced with another female guitarist, Norma-Jean Wofford (\"The Duchess\").Jones played guitar on Les Cooper's 1962 instrumental \"Wiggle Wobble\" and percussion on the 1967 hit \"San Franciscan Nights\" by Eric Burdon and The Animals and other recordings and later backed James Brown and Sam & Dave.  She remained musically active well into the 21st century.\n\nSolo work\nShe left Bo Diddley's band in 1961 to focus on her work with the Jewels. In 1970, she re-joined Bo Diddley’s band, bringing The Jewels with her.\nJones was known for playing the Roland guitar synthesizer, an experimental instrument not typically heard in rhythm and blues music.\n\nRelationships\nJones met Bo Diddley in 1956 backstage after playing with the Bop-Chords in the Apollo Theater in the neighborhood of Harlem. Many assumed that Lady Bo and Bo Diddley were a couple but that was not the case. She was married to the band’s bass player, Wally Malone.Malone lived in the mountains of western Pennsylvania when he first met Jones in a New York club in the 1960s. Later, Jones invited Malone into her band in 1968 and got married. They both moved to San Jose, California where Jones played at a show with Bo Diddley and that was the time she received her nickname, “Lady Bo.” In 1962 Jones left Bo Diddley and recruited The Duchess to play for him. In 1979, Malone and Jones moved to Boulder Creek.\n\nDeath\nAt the age of 75, Peggy Jones died on September 16, 2015, leaving behind her husband, Wally Malone. He announced his wife’s death via Facebook, saying, “Today is one of the saddest days of my life. My wife and partner of 47 years has been called up to that great rock & roll band in the heavens to be reunited with Bo Diddley, Jerome Green and Clifton James. The last hour and a quarter I spent by her side and the last thing I said to her was the quote above regarding Diddley and band. The other thing I added at the end of it is that band doesn’t have a bass player and for them to please hold that seat until it is my time to join them. The incredible part of this is immediately after saying this to her there was a quick sound that came from her and right then her heart stopped beating. Many of you know about the Bo Diddley connection but in case not my wife’s professional stage name is Lady Bo.”\n\nDiscography\nWith Bo Diddley\n\nGo Bo Diddley (Checker, 1959)\nHave Guitar Will Travel (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley in the Spotlight (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley Is a Gunslinger (Checker, 1960)\nBo Diddley Is a Lover (Checker, 1961)\nBo Diddley's a Twister (Checker, 1962)\nBo Diddley (Checker, 1962)\nPassage 10:\nJovan Markovski\nJovan Markovski (born March 28, 1988) is a Macedonian professional basketball small forward who last played for TFT.

This was a private company under a government contract to provide public radio programming. The BCC still exists today, but in 1998 the Voice of Free China and the government-owned Central Broadcasting System merged.\nWith the easing of cross-strait relations and the liberalization of Taiwan's government, the Voice of Free China changed its name to Radio Taipei International in 1998 and also used the name \"Voice of Asia\" for some broadcasts. In 2003, it became Radio Taiwan International reflecting the defeat of the Kuomintang government in 2000 and the new government's orientation towards Taiwan independence from China.

It provides port access and railroad interchange services not only to the more than twenty businesses at the park, but also to any business seeking to ship or receive cargo through the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System.\n\nHistory\nPurchase of 151 acres in July 1967 started the planning process for the dock area at the Port.  Four miles of railroad were constructed by July, 1968, the year in which the port began operations.   In 1970, the railroad connected to what were then the Rock Island Railroad and the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and started work on a marshalling yard.  By 1974 the marshalling yard was complete.    In 1977, railroad engine storage and maintenance buildings were completed.\n\nInterchange\nThe line extends from the dock to the interchange point with what is now the Union Pacific (UP) at a junction near Clinton National Airport.  Access to what is now the BNSF is obtained through trackage/haulage rights.\n\nOperations\nThe port railroad operates with two locomotives and five crew members.  It utilizes a tandem unit with an EMD GP15-1 locomotive owned by the port, and one EMD SW1500 locomotive leased from GATX.  The railroad handles over 20,000 cars annually.\nPassage 5:\nJamal Beyg\nJamal Beyg (Persian: جمال بيگ, also Romanized as Jamāl Beyg) is a village in Dezhkord Rural District, Sedeh District, Eqlid County, Fars Province, Iran.

The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers 1,588 acres (6.43 km2) and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers 1,309 acres (5.30 km2), again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north.The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called \"estate named after Abba\", and the village was listed as Abintone in the Domesday Book. The 'Great' and 'Little' prefixes came later: the Latin magna is observed from 1218 and the Modern English great from 1523 while the Latin parva is observed from 1218 and the Middle English littel from 1336.In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham.The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s.\n\nChurches\nGreat Abington's parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire.Little Abington's parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century.\nA Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed.\n\nVillage life\nThe village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team.\nThe village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a café, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents.\nThe remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers' Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King's Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.\nPassage 8:\nLittle Rock Creek\nLittle Rock Creek may refer to:\n\nLittle Rock Creek (Los Angeles County, California)\nLittle Rock Creek (Minnesota River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Mississippi River), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Red Lake), a stream in Minnesota\nLittle Rock Creek (Montana)\nPassage 9:\nThe Abingtons, Cambridgeshire\nThe Abingtons are a community in South Cambridgeshire consisting of two small villages: Little Abington and Great Abington, about 7 miles (11 km) south east of Cambridge.\n\nHistory\nThough often listed as a single entity, Great and Little Abington have since early medieval times been two parishes divided by the River Granta and remain so.

He appeared on several television programs, including Seinfeld.\n\nEarly life\nSaluga was born on September 16, 1937 in Youngstown, Ohio. When Saluga was 10, his father was killed in an industrial accident at the Republic Steel Mill where he worked and his mother supported the family by working as a bookkeeper. Saluga, known as \"Billy\" to his friends and family, was a high school cheerleader and class clown. After graduation, he served two years in the Navy and then began working as a performer in local theaters.\n\nCareer\nSaluga spent several years performing in Youngstown, Ohio theaters and clubs. He played numerous roles in notable productions, including Guys and Dolls and Inherit the Wind. Saluga became a talent coordinator for the Steve  Allen show in the late 1960s. in 1969, he created the \"Johnson\" character while a member of the comedic troupe Ace Trucking Company.Saluga's shtick as the character \"Johnson\" would be, when someone would refer to him as \"Mr. Johnson\" or by the common generic nickname \"Johnson,\" to exaggeratedly feign offense and list off all permutations of the name Raymond J. Johnson Jr. and nicknames thereof that do not mention the word \"Johnson:\"\n\n\"NOOO!!! You don't have to call me Johnson! My name is Raymond J. Johnson Jr.  Now you can call me Ray, or you can call me J, or you can call me Johnny, or you can call me Sonny, or you can call me Junie, or you can call me Junior; now you can call me Ray J, or you can call me RJ, or you can call me RJJ, or you can call me RJJ Jr. . . but you doesn't hasta call me Johnson!\" \nSaluga would then smugly turn away and begin puffing on his cigar. Saluga's routine \nreceived more widespread attention in the late 1970s after being used in a series of commercials for Miller Lite beer, and subsequently, in the early 1980s for Anheuser-Busch Natural Light beer. Saluga appeared alongside comedian/pitchman Norm Crosby echoing (in a roundabout way) Norm's advice to unknowing customers on how to more easily order the lengthily-named beer: \"Well, y'doesn't hasta call it Anheuser Busch Natural Light Beer, and y'doesn't hasta call it 'Busch Natural.'  Just say 'Natural!'\" Saluga then later launches into the \"You can call me Ray\" routine after Crosby warns not to ask Johnson his name.From 1977 to 1978, Saluga appeared regularly as Raymond J. Johnson Jr. on Redd Foxx's eponymous variety show. Saluga as Johnson also made appearances on This Is Tom Jones, Laugh-In  and The David Steinberg Show. He also made appearances on Chuck Barris' The Gong Show during 1977 and 1978.\nA novelty disco single called \"Dancin' Johnson,\" based around Johnson's schtick, was released in 1978. a 1978 episode of Good Times contained a scene where Keith (while intoxicated) recited \"You can call me Ray, or you can call me J\" which was at the height of its popularity for the saying.\nBob Dylan referenced the \"you may call me\" schtick in his 1979 hit, \"Gotta Serve Somebody,\" when he sings, \"You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy / You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy / You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray / You may call me anything, but no matter what you say / You’re gonna have to serve somebody.\" The idea for the verse originated from Jerry Wexler, who suggested it during the recording sessions for Slow Train Coming.\nThe character's popularity is referenced in multiple episodes of The Simpsons, with Saluga appearing as himself in the 2002 episode \"The Old Man and the Key\". Saluga also appeared as Johnson in the 2010 King of the Hill episode \"Just Another Manic Kahn-Day\".\n\nDeath and legacy\nSaluga died of cardiopulmonary arrest in Los Angeles on March 28, 2023, at the age of 85. Saluga's nephew, Scott Saluga, told the media that his uncle was living in Burbank, California at the time of his death. Saluga did not have any surviving immediate family members.Saluga told friends he didn't mind being typecast and known to the public as Raymond Johnson. Comedian David Steinberg said that \"Billy was always doing Ray J. He was relentless with it. I would say 'Mr. Johnson' and Billy would be off. He did it everywhere. At parties. His timing and delivery were so funny every time.\"In 2017, Saluga said that people never recognized him outside his character and that it gave him great pleasure hearing people perform his shtick in his presence without knowing who he was.\n\nBibliography\nSaluga, Bill (1982).

His works include La Garçonne (1936) and The Letter (1929). A French army officer and a designer, he first came to the United States with his parents, Count and Countess de Limur in September 1920; their destination was Burlingame, California, where lived Jean's brother André (who married Ethel, daughter of William Henry Crocker).\n\nFilmography\nThe Arab (1924) actor\nHuman Desires (1924)\nThe Legion of the Condemned (1928) co-screenplay\nThe Letter (1929) director\nJealousy (1929) director\nMy Childish Father (1930)\nPaprika (1933) director\nL'Auberge du Petit-Dragon (1935)\nLa Garçonne (1936) director; with Arletty, Edith Piaf, and Marie Bell\nPassage 2:\nAndréa Ferréol\nAndréa Ferréol (born Andrée Louise Ferréol; January 6, 1947) is a French actress and officer of the Ordre national du Mérite (2009).\nHer debut was in the 1973 film La Grande bouffe, which made a big scandal at the Cannes Film Festival.She was the last partner of Egyptian actor Omar Sharif.\n\nFilmography\nPassage 3:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983–85), Government Publications Office (1985–86), and Department of Finance (1986–89). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After Cézanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 4:\nDana Blankstein\nDana Blankstein-Cohen (born March 3, 1981) is the executive director of the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School.

Meanwhile, in the Philippines, crime lord Min Deng, the older brother of Wu Ji, hires ex-US Navy SEAL “Tom Cat” (Scott Adkins) and his group to assassinate Leng Feng and avenge his brother.\nThe Wolf Warriors participate in a training exercise in a remote and uninhabited forested region on China's southern border. During the exercise, Tom Cat and his mercenaries ambush a Wolf Warrior squad, killing one of Leng Feng's comrades. Subsequently, the PLA and the Wolf Warriors are tasked with hunting down Tom Cat‘s squad to restore their honor. The combined infantry force move into the forest but are delayed by multiple traps set by Tom Cat and pinned down by sniper fire until Leng Feng manages to kill the shooter. Afterwards, the rest of the PLA force engages Tom Cat's other mercenaries, who stage a fighting retreat but are eventually overwhelmed and killed one by one. Meanwhile, Long Xiaoyun and the other PLA commanders deduce that Ming Deng himself is also in the training area to take possession of a smuggled cache of biotechnology, which could allow the creation of a genetic weapon that could target Chinese people exclusively.\nLeng Feng eventually catches Tom Cat just before China's southern border.
