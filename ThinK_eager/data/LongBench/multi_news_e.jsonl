NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sheriff’s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle’s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff’s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn’t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,” Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot then tried to climb out of the car’s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot’s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was “‘the Michael Elliot,” and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn’t lie about his identity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and “a couple of jackets.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wright said authorities didn’t know Elliot would be in their area — there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area — and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. “The swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. …Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner’s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn’t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie’s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case — namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot’s innocence. A state court denied his request. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA Palestinian teen was reportedly abducted and killed near his home in Jerusalem on Wednesday, apparently in revenge for the deaths of three kidnapped Jewish Israelis buried just hours earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The crime, which brought strong condemnations from the Obama Administration and European officials, threatened to throw the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians beyond the control of leaders who were calculating how to respond to the last outrage without further escalating tensions on the ground. But in the space of a few hours, the mood shifted from communal grief over the deaths of the young Israelis to fears of ascending communal violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The abduction followed a night of mayhem by Jewish extremists, about 200 of whom marched through Jerusalem chanting “Death to the Arabs” and assaulting Arab Israelis found on the streets. A few hours later, shortly before 4 a.m., Muhammad Hussein Abu Khdeir, 16, was forced into a car by two men on a sidewalk not far from his home in Shuafat, a Palestinian neighborhood of East Jerusalem. An hour later police discovered a charred body in a forest on the outskirts of the city. Family members said it was Muhammad, who had been on his way to dawn prayers, as was customary during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The settlers killed my son, they kidnapped him and killed him,” his father, Hussein Saed Abu Khdeir, told TIME after returning from Jerusalem’s main police station. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He reached for his Samsung smartphone, tapped the screen and pulled up a photo of two young men on a sidewalk. He said the image had been taken from a surveillance camera at a candy store around the corner that recorded the abduction. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “These are the ones who kidnapped my son,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A few yards away, dozens of young men flung stones at Israeli riot police assembled two blocks downhill. The riot began shortly after the body was discovered, and went on all day. Police fired foam-tipped bullets and sound grenades. Youths twirled slingshots and the occasional Molotov cocktail. The pavement between the two sides might have been gravel, so littered was it with stones. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A row of ambulances stood by a hundred feet behind the tin barricades protesters had erected beside the building containing the Khdeirs’ home. As an ambulance driver reported that more than 60 people had been wounded by 5 p.m., another injured youth arrived, slung across the shoulders of a heavyset man in an orange medic’s vest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement urging both sides “not to take the law into your own hands” and promising to “uncover quickly who is behind this despicable murder and what motivated it.” A relative of one of the Jewish Israeli teens, Naftali Fraenkel, who also held U.S. citizenship, was quoted as saying “If a young Arab man was murdered for nationalistic reasons then it is a horrifying and disgusting act. There is no distinguishing blood from blood. Murder is murder, whatever the nationality or age may be. There is no justification, no forgiveness and no atonement for any murder.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the distance between the sides grows with each incident. At the political level, Palestinian leaders leaped at the opportunity to turn the tables on Israel, which used the teens’ disappearance as a pretense to arrest more than 400 West Bank activists, most of them with the militant Islamist group Hamas that Netanyahu blames for the teens’ deaths. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Israel bears full responsibility for this incident,” Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement, which concluded with a threat to drag Israel before U.N. courts, the most militant course Abbas has been willing to chart. “The Palestinian leadership will continue its discussions following this escalation, including joining international organizations.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On the ground, pessimism ruled. Hussein Abu Khdeir was asked if he had faith in the Israeli police he had spent most of the day with. “No,” he said. Why not? “Because we’re Arab.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They are not concerned,” volunteered Yousef Mkhemer, a community activist seated across the crowded porch. Alluding to Netanyahu’s historic support for Jewish settlements on the West Bank, he said, “The boss of the settlers is the boss of the government. So he cannot shame himself.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The distrust runs beyond political leader, however, to alternate realities. Many if not most Palestinians refuse to say that the three Israeli teens were abducted at all. Their disappearance is widely regarded as an excuse to force apart the newly minted unity government supported by both Hamas and Abbas’ secular Fatah party — a reconciliation polls show has been enthusiastically embraced by Palestinians, but condemned by Netanyahu, who has repeatedly invoked the teens’ kidnapping as reason for dismembering it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a lie,” said Amjad Dweik, 18, of the Israeli teens’ kidnapping and murder. “As soon as the two parties Fatah and Hamas began the reconciliation, Israel began to make up all kinds of things to ruin the unit.” Hussein Abu Khdeir agreed: “They did it,” he said, referring to Israel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the next breath, the skeptics describe the abduction of Muhammad as vigilante vengeance for the death of the Jewish teens. Residents say young Jewish Israelis had been stalking Shuafat since the bodies were discovered on Monday. Dweik and others spoke of a boy of 9 pulled away from his mother by young Jews a day earlier on the same street where Muhammad was taken. The boy was saved, they say, when passersby intervened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was scratched,” said Hussein Abu Khdeir, referring to the child, who local residents say had been holding his mother’s hand. “They grabbed him by his neck.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His own son’s abduction and apparent death were likewise revenge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Yes, of course,” he said. “There’s no other explanation.”\nPassage 2:\nMedia caption Mohammed Abu Khdair's mother: \"My son wasn't answering\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The funeral of a Palestinian teenager abducted and killed in Jerusalem has been delayed so that a post-mortem examination can be completed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In another development, Hussein Abu Khdair said he was held by police for eight hours and put under pressure to say his son's killing was unlikely to be an attack to avenge the deaths of the Israeli youths. Israeli police have denied this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One of the dead teenager's cousins, Dimah Abu Khdeir, said of Israelis: \"They don't care about us... We're not considered citizens.

This was a direct response to a particular egregious filming of the show in our space which saw our store left a mess, our staff mistreated, our neighbors forced to close and lose business for a day without warning, and our repeated attempts to obtain accountability or resolution dismissed. It was also a direct response to a show which is in every way diametrically opposed to our politics and the vision of society we’re organizing to realize. A show which has had a net negative effect on our neighborhood and the city of Portland as a whole. Shortly after this decision was made, a volunteer placed the Fuck Portlandia sign in our window.

It also does not cover the additional business lost by our neighbors who at times also have to remain closed for filming.

In a world where trans femmes – particularly Black trans women – are being brutalized and murdered on a regular basis for simply daring to exist, dude in a dress jokes are lazy, reactionary, and actively harmful. They’re also just straight up not funny. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Also: there are no Black people on Portlandia. There are a tiny number of people of color on Portlandia. Portland is white but it’s not that damn white. It’s also a city with a deeply entrenched history of racism and white supremacy. In Other Words is in the heart of a historically Black neighborhood in Northeast Portland. We have Black Lives Matter written on our window. Black Lives Matter Portland meets regularly in our space. But as more and more Black folks and people of color have become involved at In Other Words, Portlandia has only gotten steadfastly more white. Oh and also: the last time the show filmed in our space, the production crew asked to us to remove the Black Lives Matter sign on our window. We refused. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gentrification Isn’t a Joke NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Portlandia is fueling mass displacement in Portland.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nSummary NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investigative Highlights NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State employees and agencies engaged in various improper governmental activities, including the following: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » Four employees at several agencies misused state time and cost the State approximately $160,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two employees either took extended breaks or left the premises over a five‑year period. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee regularly left early from work over two years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR One employee slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » A nursing director removed an LVN, who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position to perform duties typically performed by an office technician. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR » An official built an unauthorized structure on state property with the help of on‑duty staff under his command. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results in Brief NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Whistleblower Protection Act (Whistleblower Act) empowers the California State Auditor's Office (State Auditor) to investigate and report on improper governmental activities by agencies and employees of the State. Under the Whistleblower Act, an improper governmental activity includes any action by a state agency or employee related to state government that violates a law; is economically wasteful; or involves gross misconduct, incompetence, or inefficiency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, the State Auditor conducted investigative work on 1,481 cases. This report contains seven examples of investigations that substantiated improper governmental activities, including misuse of state time and inaccurate attendance records, economically wasteful activities, and misuse of government property. In addition, during the past year, the State Auditor issued nonpublic reports regarding nepotism, bad-faith hires, improper promotions, and other misconduct by executive management within two state entities. It provided these reports to those who could remediate the problems and ensure that the management teams involved did not retaliate against perceived whistleblowers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Fresno NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two facilities operations employees at California State University, Fresno engaged in egregious and continued time and attendance abuse by taking extended breaks or leaving campus without accounting for their time. From 2013 through 2017, two employees failed to account for more than 5,100 hours of work, costing the State more than $111,000 in salary paid for work not performed. Furthermore, the employees were dishonest in their attempts to conceal their time and attendance abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Kern Valley State Prison NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For about two years, an employee at Kern Valley State Prison misused state time by regularly leaving work up to 45 minutes early as a result of inadequate supervision. We estimated that the employee failed to account for 312 hours of missed work time, costing the State nearly $9,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Department of Motor Vehicles NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A key data operator at the Department of Motor Vehicles failed to perform her essential duties over a period of nearly four years because she slept at her desk for extended periods of time during work hours. From February 2014 through December 2017, the employee misused more than 2,200 hours of work time as a result of sleeping on the job, costing the State more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Correctional Health Care Services NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR From May 2015 through July 2016, a director of nursing (nursing director) at a Southern California adult prison removed a licensed vocational nurse (LVN), who was her personal friend, from her assigned nursing position—or post—providing patient care and reassigned her to perform nurse scheduling duties typically performed by an office technician. During this period, the LVN continued to receive her pay as a nurse even though she provided patient care only when she worked occasional overtime shifts, causing California Correctional Health Care Services (Correctional Health Care) to waste $10,500 in unnecessary salary payments. Furthermore, the nursing director's decision cost the State an additional $18,700 in unnecessary overtime payments that Correctional Health Care paid to other nurses to cover the LVN's originally assigned post, resulting in total waste of nearly $30,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) overpaid a staff services analyst (analyst) at one of its prisons nearly $3,000 from July 2016 through March 2017. The analyst, her manager, an associate warden, and a personnel specialist all failed to follow CDCR procedure and the California Department of Human Resources' policy regarding inmate supervision pay, which resulted in the overpayments. In addition, the associate warden violated state law by choosing not to initiate any collection efforts after two internal audits in 2017 documented the error in pay and recommended the recovery of the overpayments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California State University, Dominguez Hills NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In March 2013, a manager at California State University, Dominguez Hills directed a member of his staff to purchase a Nissan-manufactured electric vehicle quick charger for nearly $7,000 before the manager had performed the due diligence necessary to ensure that the equipment was compatible with the energy resource plan for the campus. The quick charger has remained unused for five years, its warranty lapsed in 2014, and Nissan is no longer manufacturing replacement parts. As of February 2018, the campus told us it will be unable to install the quick charger before 2020 or 2021, if at all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) assistant chief misused state resources when he violated his rental agreement by building an unauthorized structure on state property using on-duty staff under his command. In 2016 the assistant chief built a 16-foot-by-20-foot structure with plumbing, electrical, and sewer connections in the backyard of the state residence he rented from CAL FIRE without written approval from CAL FIRE to build the structure as his rental agreement required. He also did not have approval from the Office of the State Fire Marshal, which is responsible for inspecting state‑owned buildings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report estimates the employee slept three or more hours daily at her desk since February 2014, totaling over 2,200 hours of work time and costing more than $40,000. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee worked as a key data operator. Her duties included \"routine data entry for change of address and new vehicle ownership forms,\" the report says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She processed less than half the documents that she was expected to – an average of 200 documents a day, when key data operators are expected to process more than 550, according to the report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While her supervisors were aware of the issue, the report found that they underestimated the amount of time the employee was sleeping on the job and did not properly follow disciplinary procedures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A supervisor reported waking the employee up \"three to four times each day,\" the report says. It says the work the employee did complete \"was often so inaccurate\" that coworkers wouldn't trust her to correctly enter their address or vehicle ownership change. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Supervisors suspected a medical issue was contributing to the employee's problems, which led them to be \"reluctant to take further steps to address the employee’s sleeping and poor production.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee's doctor told the DMV she was unable to perform the duties associated with her job. Subsequently, the employee obtained a physician's release saying she was able to perform her job's duties, the report says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahmoud Ghozlan, spokesman for the Brotherhood, was quoted on the group's Facebook page as saying the abuses were committed by groups that \"imagined they could shake legitimacy or impose their view with force\".\nPassage 2:\n* Rival factions hurl petrol bombs, stones outside palace NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Clinton calls for dialogue on contested constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR * Vice president offers olive branch to opposition NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By Yasmine Saleh and Marwa Awad NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CAIRO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Islamists fought protesters outside the Egyptian president's palace on Wednesday, while inside the building his deputy proposed a way to end a crisis over a draft constitution that has split the most populous Arab nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stones and petrol bombs flew between opposition protesters and supporters of President Mohamed Mursi who had flocked to the palace in response to a call from the Muslim Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two Islamists were hit in the legs by what their friends said were bullets fired during the clashes in streets around the compound in northern Cairo. One of them was bleeding heavily. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A leftist group said Islamists had cut off the ear of one of its members. Medical sources said 23 people had been wounded in clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Riot police deployed between the two sides to try to stop the confrontations which flared after dark despite an attempt by Vice President Mahmoud Mekky to calm the political crisis. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said amendments to disputed articles in the draft constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then be submitted to the next parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on Dec. 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference, saying opposition demands had to be respected to reach a solution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Facing the gravest crisis of his six-month-old tenure, Mursi has shown no sign of buckling, confident that Islamists can win the referendum and a parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many Egyptians yearn for an end to political upheaval that has scared off investors and tourists, damaging the economy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence around his palace and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped a decree he issued on Nov. 22 that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We hold President Mursi and his government completely responsible for the violence happening in Egypt today,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR POLARISATION NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is cancelled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he said of the document written by an Islamist-led assembly that the opposition says ignores its concerns. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarisation and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" the former head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the Nov. 22 decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by ousted strongman Hosni Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rival groups skirmished outside the presidential palace earlier on Wednesday. Islamist supporters of Mursi tore down tents erected by leftist foes, who had begun a sit-in there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They hit us and destroyed our tents. Are you happy, Mursi? Aren't we Egyptians too?\" asked protester Haitham Ahmed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mohamed Mohy, a pro-Mursi demonstrator who was filming the scene, said: \"We are here to support our president and his decisions and save our country from traitors and agents.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilisation by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DIALOGUE NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It needs to be a two-way dialogue ... among Egyptians themselves about the constitutional process and the substance of the constitution,\" Clinton told a news conference in Brussels. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Washington is worried about rising Islamist power in Egypt, a staunch U.S. security partner under Mubarak, who preserved the U.S.-brokered peace treaty Cairo signed with Israel in 1979. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood had summoned supporters to an open-ended demonstration at the presidential palace, a day after about 10,000 opposition protesters had encircled it for what organisers dubbed a \"last warning\" to Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The people want the downfall of the regime,\" they chanted, roaring the signature slogan of last year's anti-Mubarak revolt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The \"last warning\" may turn out to be one of the last gasps for a disparate opposition that has little chance of scuttling next week's vote on the draft constitution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a bold move, Mursi sacked Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the Mubarak-era army commander and defence minister, in August and removed the sweeping powers that the military council, which took over after Mubarak fell, had grabbed two months earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots political base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Investors have seized on hopes that Egypt's turbulent transition, which has buffeted the economy for two years, may soon head for calmer waters, sending stocks 1.6 percent higher after a 3.5 percent rally on Tuesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt has turned to the IMF for a $4.8 billion loan after the depletion of its foreign currency reserves. The government said on Wednesday the process was on track and its request would go to the IMF board as expected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The board is due to review the facility on Dec. 19. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Elijah Zarwan, a fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that if Egypt was to find a compromise solution to its crisis, it would not be through slogans and blows. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It will be through quiet negotiation, not through duelling press conferences, street brawls, or civil strife.\"\nPassage 3:\nCAIRO (Reuters) - Islamists battled with protesters outside Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi's palace on Thursday, after his vice president suggested amendments could be agreed to the draft constitution that has divided the nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fires burned in the streets near the palace perimeter where opponents and supporters of Mursi threw stones and petrol bombs. Riot police tried to separate the two sides, but failed to halt fighting that extended from Wednesday into the early morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents, frustrated that police had not calmed the streets, set up makeshift road blocks nearby to check passers-by, scenes reminiscent of the popular uprising that toppled Mursi's autocratic predecessor Hosni Mubarak. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medical sources said 211 people were wounded, some with gunshot wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"No to dictatorship,\" Mursi's opponents chanted, while their rivals chanted: \"Defending Mursi is defending Islam.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi's opponents accused him of creating a new autocracy by awarding himself extraordinary powers in a decree on November 22 and were further angered when an Islamist-dominated assembly pushed through a draft constitution that opponents said did not properly represent the aspirations of the whole nation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States, worried about the stability of a state that has a peace deal with Israel and to which it gives $1.3 billion in military aid each year, called for dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bidding to end the worst crisis since Mursi took office less than six months ago, Vice President Mahmoud Mekky said amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be elected after a referendum on the constitution on December 15. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There must be consensus,\" he told a news conference inside the presidential palace as fighting raged outside on Wednesday evening, saying opposition demands had to be respected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PROTESTS SPREAD NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prime Minister Hisham Kandil called for calm to \"give the opportunity\" for efforts underway to start a national dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Mursi has shown no sign of buckling under pressure from protestors, confident that the Islamists, who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown in February 2011, can win the referendum and parliamentary election to follow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On top of the support of the Brotherhood, which backed him for the presidency in the June election, Mursi may also be able to rely on a popular yearning for stability and economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egypt's opposition coalition blamed Mursi for the violence and said it was ready for dialogue if the Islamist leader scrapped the decree that gave him wide powers and shielded his decisions from judicial review. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Today what is happening in the Egyptian street, polarization and division, is something that could and is actually drawing us to violence and could draw us to something worse,\" opposition coordinator Mohamed ElBaradei said on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We are ready for dialogue if the constitutional decree is canceled ... and the referendum on this constitution is postponed,\" he told a news conference. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But liberals, leftists, Christians, ex-Mubarak followers and others opposed to Mursi have yet to generate a mass movement or a grassroots base to challenge the Brotherhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'REAL DANGER' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Opposition leaders have previously urged Mursi to retract the decree, defer the referendum and agree to revise the constitution, but have not echoed calls from street protesters for his overthrow and the \"downfall of the regime\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mursi has said his decree was needed to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political transition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mekky said street mobilization by both sides posed a \"real danger\" to Egypt. \"If we do not put a stop to this phenomenon right away ... where are we headed? We must calm down.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed into Egypt's political debate, saying dialogue was urgently needed on the new constitution, which should \"respect the rights of all citizens\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Clinton and Mursi worked together last month to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR British Foreign Secretary William Hague called for restraint on all sides. He said Egypt's authorities had to make progress on the transition in an \"inclusive manner\" and urged dialogue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both Islamists and their opponents have staged big shows of strength on the streets since Mursi's controversial decree, each bringing out tens of thousands of people. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR State institutions, with the partial exception of the judiciary, have mostly fallen in behind Mursi. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The army, the muscle behind all previous Egyptian presidents in the republic's six-decade history, has gone back to barracks, having apparently lost its appetite to intervene in politics.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nBERLIN (AP) — German prosecutors said Wednesday they have indicted two former Nazi SS guards in their 90s on charges of being accessories to murder while they worked at a World War II concentration camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both men served as guards at the Stutthof concentration camp, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk, Dortmund prosecutor Andreas Brendel told The Associated Press. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The indictments were filed against a 93-year-old man from Borken who served in Stutthof from June 1942 to September 1944 and a 92-year-old man from Wuppertal who was there from June 1944 to May 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges were filed last week at the state court in Muenster but only announced Wednesday because the defendants first had to be notified. Both deny they had any knowledge of killings at the camp, Brendel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 65,000 people died at Stutthof. Some were put to death in gas chambers or shot, while others died from malnutrition or froze to death. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The men, who have not been named, both served as guards and also watched over prisoners who were taken outside the camp to work. During the time they were at Stutthof, hundreds of killings occurred. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Members of the SS killed more than 100 Polish prisoners and some 77 Soviet prisoners of war in the camp's gas chamber in 1944. An unknown number of Jews also were gassed there in late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Between June 1944 and April 1945, SS members also killed several hundred Jews by shooting them in the back of the neck. SS-physicians and nurses at Stutthof killed more than 140 prisoners, many of them Jewish women and children, by injecting their hearts with gasoline and the chemical compound phenol from late 1942 until late 1944. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The prosecutors assume that the accused were aware of the different killing methods ...and that such a multitude of people could have only been killed with such regularity because the victims were guarded by helpers like them,\" the court wrote in a statement issued Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two men therefore willingly supported several hundreds of killings of camp inmates in their function as guards, the statement added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR German prosecutors in recent years have pursued Nazi suspects under new legal reasoning that, even without evidence of a specific crime, they can be prosecuted if they helped camps operate.\nPassage 2:\nIn Judith Meisel’s last image of her mother, Mina, she is standing outside a gas chamber at the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland, awaiting the same fate that befell 65,000 other prisoners there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This summer, as she has countless times before, the St. Louis Park resident relived the experience in wrenching detail, but this time for a set of German prosecutors who, aided by Minnesota FBI agents, were racing to bring to justice the few Nazis still alive who can be linked to World War II-era atrocities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now Meisel, 88, knows her assistance paid off: German authorities this month indicted two ex-guards on charges of being accessories to many of the murders at Stutthof, located near what is now the Polish city of Gdansk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Under German law, Meisel could join prosecutors as a “co-plaintiff” in the case. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In June, Meisel stunned the Germans, and her family, when she identified one of the ex-guards, Johann Rehbogen, as a teenage SS officer who taunted her and other female prisoners as they undressed each morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges, made possible by new German legal guidance allowing the prosecution of former Nazis who can’t be tied to specific killings, represent a new and vital chapter for survivors like Meisel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Holocaust survivor Judy Meisel held a photo of her parents Osser Beker and Mika Beker that was taken around 1938. Judy's mother died in the gas chamber at Stutthof concentration camp on the Baltic coast in late 1944 or early 1945. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I understand that the person who has been indicted was a young man at the time,” Meisel said. “Still, the questions he must answer are an important part of this story.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR How, for example, did he take such a gruesome job at such a young age? What did he think when he watched women and children being killed on an industrial scale? How has he explained his past to his family and friends? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel awaits any details the 94-year-old Rehbogen can provide, even if it means she must again relive the horror of her years inside the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,” Meisel said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What comes next? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prosecutors in Dortmund indicted Rehbogen and Harry Paul Fritz Schulz, 92, on charges stemming from their tenures at the camp from 1942 to 1944. Since 2011, German authorities have been pursuing cases against Nazis whom they believe they can prove helped operate concentration camps during the war. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Dortmund prosecutor told the Associated Press this month that both men denied knowing anything about the killings at the camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel’s description of life in the camp — and law enforcement interviews with other Americans identified as Stutthof survivors — are essential for prosecutors to challenge those denials. In June, Meisel instantly recognized a photo of Rehbogen, whom she and other prisoners called “Meydele” for his girlish looks, and said he was among those who taunted and beat prisoners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cornelius Nestler, a German professor and lawyer who has represented Holocaust survivors in similar cases, found Meisel online and connected her with German authorities who weren’t sure how many, if any, Stutthof survivors were still alive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nestler told the Star Tribune in an e-mail that the defendants will have an opportunity to challenge the indictment and will likely be evaluated by medical experts for their fitness to stand trial. Nestler said that the trial could commence next summer if the defendants are deemed healthy enough. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel, he said, could “take the stand as a witness,” or at least observe the proceedings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Important lessons’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meisel’s son, Michael Cohen, said he’s not sure if his mother would travel to Germany or participate in the prosecution from afar. German authorities also named witnesses from Ohio, New Jersey, New York and Florida. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The charges came as a surprise to the family, Cohen said, and represented a determination not to “simply move aside and forget about” those responsible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, a Minneapolis attorney, said news of the charges brought back new, vivid memories for his mother that include witnessing camp inmates killed by injections administered by Stutthof doctors. Meisel has since spent much of the month thinking of her mother and sister Rachel, who was forced on a death march away from the camp with her in early 1945 that they both escaped. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen said Meisel has described her mother as a woman of forgiveness, but is still unsure how she would respond to the charges. “She’s very interested in what comes next,” Cohen said this week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also said the wave of emotions has taken its toll on his mother. As an activist, she has told her story to audiences across the country, but in the days since learning of the indictments, Meisel has privately revisited what it meant to be a Stutthof inmate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR While she still has nightmares, Meisel said she welcomes any chance to tell her story “for the important lessons it teaches about tolerance and racism.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She said she cannot forget the message from some of her fellow prisoners: “Don’t let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.”\n", "answers": ["Judith Meisel says that when she was a teenager in the Stutthof concentration camp in western Poland, other prisoners told her: \"Don't let us die without you mentioning what happened to us.\" The 88-year-old Minnesota resident has not forgotten: Her testimony helped German authorities indict two former guards from the camp where 65,000 people, including Meisel's mother, died, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. She identified one former guard, 94-year-old Johann Rehbogen, as the young SS officer who would taunt female prisoners as they undressed. Prosecutors say the men can't be tied to specific murders, but their work as guards made the killings possible. Meisel—who escaped along with her sister when inmates were sent on a \"death march\" away from the camp in 1945—says she is willing to relive her horrific experiences to help prosecutors. \"This process of seeking answers and finding justice for my mother gives new meaning to my life,\" she says. The two former guards have been charged as accessories to murder, the AP reports. They deny any knowledge of killings at the camp, where thousands were starved to death or froze. Prosecutors say prisoners were also gassed to death, shot, and killed with lethal injections. Authorities say Meisel and several other Stutthof survivors in the US could be called as witnesses if the former guards are deemed healthy enough to stand trial.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to The Washington Post spokesman, Jim McGrath, released a full statement on Wednesday: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At age 93, President Bush has been confined to a wheelchair for roughly five years, so his arm falls on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures. To try to put people at ease, the president routinely tells the same joke — and on occasion, he has patted women’s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner. Some have seen it as innocent; others clearly view it as inappropriate. To anyone he has offended, President Bush apologizes most sincerely. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR EARLIER: Turn: Washington’s Spies actress Heather Lind has come forward with accusations that President George H.W. Bush sexually assaulted her during a photo opportunity with his wife Barbara Bush standing by his side. Bush has since apologized for the incident saying that it was an “attempt at humor” and that he didn’t mean to offend Lind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lind made the accusations through a lengthy Instagram post that has since been deleted. She recently saw a photo of the 93-year-old wheelchair bound Bush shaking hands with Barack Obama at the One America Appeal hurricane relief concert which prompted her to share her alleged experience saying, “…when I got the chance to meet George H. W. Bush four years ago to promote a historical television show I was working on, he sexually assaulted me while I was posing for a similar photo.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Instagram post continued saying that Bush touched her from behind and told her a dirty joke — all while being photographed. All the while Barbara Bush “rolled her eyes as if to say ‘Not again’.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It seems to me a President’s power is in his or her capacity to enact positive change, actually help people, and serve as a symbol of our democracy,” she continued. “He relinquished that power when he used it against me and, judging from the comments of those around him, countless other women before me. What comforts me is that I too can use my power, which isn’t so different from a President really.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She closed the post saying, “My fellow cast-mates and producers helped me that day and continue to support me.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nTATAOUINE, Tunisia — A century ago, fleeing Italian colonizers, the inhabitants of Libya ’s remote western mountains descended upon this wind-whipped Tunisian outpost, many to stay permanently. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With those desert plateaus once again under siege, this time by the armies of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, about 30,000 Libyans have repeated their ancestors’ flight. Astonishingly, to aid workers, hundreds upon hundreds of Tunisians, some of them the descendants of those earlier refugees, have opened their homes to these Libyan families since early April, when Colonel Qaddafi’s forces went on the attack. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There are no sprawling refugee camps at the border, just two modest clusters of tents housing around 2,500 people. The vast majority of the newcomers are now living with Tunisian families here and in neighboring villages, an area that in normal times counts just 150,000 residents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s the first time I’ve seen such an impressive response,” said Firas Kayal, a spokesman in Tunisia for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That generosity is all the more remarkable, he added, given the challenges Tunisia faces in the wake of its own revolution — which in January ended 23 years of kleptocratic rule by President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali — and previous waves of Libyan refugees this year in the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even some of the refugees seem baffled by it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Would you give your house to someone you didn’t know, from another country?” asked Maren Abouzakhar, 22, who fled the besieged Libyan city of Yafran early this month. She spoke in the airy drawing room of the house she and 10 relatives now shared with a local family; the owner had moved himself, his wife and their three children into the unfinished ground floor, leaving the comfortable, perfumed second story for their guests. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We don’t even know how to thank them for something like this,” Ms. Abouzakhar said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abdallah Awaye, 35, a thin, sun-darkened man and the owner of the house, described his gesture as a matter of obligation and pride. “This is how it is, these are our customs,” he said. “If there is something to eat, we will eat it together. If there is nothing to eat, we will have nothing together.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the refugees arrived at the border with little more than the clothes on their backs and fears for the sons they left behind to fight the Qaddafi militias, and were rapidly taken in by local residents whose compassion and good cheer have drawn the admiration of Libyans and international aid workers alike. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Kayal also praised the generosity of the Tunisian government, which has kept the country’s borders open from the start of the Libyan conflict. As many 276,000 people — most of them foreign workers — have fled Libya for Tunisia, according to United Nations estimates. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Asked about their willingness to provide shelter to strangers, residents of Tataouine like to cite an apt local proverb: Travelers cry upon arriving in this desolate place, but leave with tears in their eyes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Despite the abundance of good intentions, though, the city and surrounding areas are feeling the strain of so many refugees. The afterglow of January’s jubilant revolution has largely given way to old frustrations, with people complaining of a stagnant economy, inadequate infrastructure and widespread unemployment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The police, the lackeys of the deposed government, are largely absent from the streets, having gone into hiding after the revolution. And many worry that the country’s transitional government has failed to break with what they call decades of neglect for the arid Tunisian south. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Generosity and fraternity have been taking precedence over the problems,” said Ali Mourou, the mayor of Tataouine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nevertheless, he said, in response to appeals from the city, truckloads of aid have flowed in from as far as Tunis, the capital, 300 miles to the north. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Three local coordinating centers have been opened, placing Libyan families in homes and distributing donated couscous, macaroni, milk and tomatoes, as well as mattresses and blankets. Libyan children have been placed in local schools, and doctors and nurses have opened a clinic offering free medical care. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We’ve taken the thing as a human obligation, a religious obligation, an obligation of fraternity,” Mr. Mourou said, and the Libyans have been “truly appreciative.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He added, “They ought to be.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He worries, though.\nPassage 2:\nTRIPOLI/TUNIS Libya's two-month civil war spilled over the border into Tunisia, provoking outrage in the western neighbor, while rebels in Misrata said only NATO could halt the bombardment of the besieged city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The struggle between forces loyal to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and rebels trying to end his more than four decades of rule drew in outsiders last month, as NATO began air strikes on government troops under a United Nations mandate. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Thursday the fighting spilled over Libya's land frontier, when Gaddafi troops battled rebels on Tunisian territory for control of the Dehiba-Wazin frontier crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The incursion was brief and limited, and Gaddafi's troops even apologized locally. But the response was nevertheless furious from Tunisia, where the Arab world's wave of uprisings began late last year, leading to the overthrow of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Given the gravity of what has happened ... the Tunisian authorities have informed the Libyans of their extreme indignation and demand measures to put an immediate stop to these violations,\" a Tunisian Foreign Ministry statement said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Illustrating the difficulty of keeping the Libyan conflict sealed within the country's land borders, artillery shells fired by Gaddafi forces also struck the Tunisian side of the crossing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels seized the post a week ago, as it controls the only road link which their comrades in Libya's Western Mountains have with the outside world, making them rely otherwise on rough tracks for supplies of food, fuel and medicine. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After weeks of advances and retreats by rebel and government forces along the Mediterranean coast, fighting has settled into a pattern of clashes and skirmishes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Thursday's battle for the crossing between Dehiba in Tunisia and Wazin on the Libyan side was typical of the fluid and confused conflict, which broke out in mid-February. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR First government troops stormed the post in what appeared to be part of a broader offensive to root out rebel outposts beyond their eastern heartland around Benghazi, Libya's second city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi's soldiers apologized to their Tunisian counterparts for the incursion and hoisted their flag at the border, tearing down a pre-Gaddafi era flag that had fluttered for a few days. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But then the rebels, who had retreated into Tunisia, counter-attacked and as the fog of war descended, rumors spread that the post was back in their hands. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the confusion, scores of vehicles headed for the border from the Tunisian side with civilians on board shouting \"We've won! We've won!\" but they swiftly turned back when they found Gaddafi's forces were still there. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR MISRATA'S PLIGHT DEEPENS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the port city of Misrata, the rebels' biggest enclave in western Libya, the plight of residents worsened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebels accused Gaddafi's forces of firing bigger rockets than the Russian-made Grad missiles largely used until now. A rebel called Marwan said in an audio statement on YouTube that the bigger rockets cause much greater destruction. \"Gaddafi the tyrant is trying to wipe out the city of Misrata,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi denies his forces are attacking civilians and says his opponents are Islamist militants and foreign-backed agitators who deliberately put non-combatants in harm's way. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rebel spokesman Abdelsalam said from Misrata that there had been sporadic clashes on the road to the port and shelling of residential areas. \"Those areas are packed with civilians who fled the fighting in the city center,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The ball is now in NATO's court. After Gaddafi's soldiers and snipers were driven out from the city center and Tripoli Street by the rebel fighters, their strategy has been to shell the city from the outskirts. This can only be solved by NATO.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Western alliance has been conducting air strikes on Libya since last month under a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for civilians to be protected. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But military deadlock in Libya has exposed growing international rifts, with critics of NATO bombing calling it another case of the West trying to overthrow a government by stretching the terms of a U.N. resolution. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR At least two loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Thursday night and NATO jets rumbled overhead. It was not immediately clear what the targets were. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The official Libyan news agency Jana also said that \"the colonial, crusader aggression\" hit civilian and military sites in a Western Mountains region town on Thursday evening. Two people were killed and many others were wounded, it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaddafi forces also took a town in the remote southeastern desert, state television reported. \"Libyan forces have seized full control of the town of Kufra and purified it of the armed gangs,\" it quoted a military spokesman as saying. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But rebels denied this. \"The battle is not over and the situation is unclear,\" said spokesman Mohamed al-Muntasser.

The richness of primary evidence continually delights.\" —Judith Sealander, author of Private Wealth and Public Life NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"[No] mere philanthropist [but a] subtle, stinging critic of our racial democracy.\" —W. E. B. DuBois on Julius Rosenwald NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this richly revealing biography of a major, but little-known, American businessman and philanthropist, Peter Ascoli brings to life a portrait of Julius Rosenwald, the man and his work. The son of first-generation German Jewish immigrants, Julius Rosenwald, known to his friends as \"JR,\" apprenticed for his uncles, who were major clothing manufacturers in New York City. It would be as a men’s clothing salesperson that JR would make his fateful encounter with Sears, Roebuck and Company, which he eventually fashioned into the greatest mail order firm in the world. He also founded Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry. And in the American South Rosenwald helped support the building of the more than 5,300 schools that bore his name. Yet the charitable fund he created during World War I went out of existence in 1948 at his expressed wish. Ascoli provides a fascinating account of Rosenwald’s meteoric rise in American business, but he also portrays a man devoted to family and with a desire to help his community that led to a lifelong devotion to philanthropy. He tells about Rosenwald’s important philanthropic activities, especially those connected with the Rosenwald schools and Booker T. Washington, and later through the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ascoli’s account of Rosenwald is an inspiring story of hard work and success, and of giving back to the nation in which he prospered.\nPassage 2:\nPHILADELPHIA (JTA) — Alex Bethea, the son of cotton and tobacco farm workers, was in sixth grade in 1965 when his family moved from Dillon, South Carolina, to the tiny town of Fairmont, North Carolina, where he attended a school called Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But it wasn’t until this week, 50 years later, that Bethea learned that his school was named for Julius Rosenwald, the Jewish philanthropist who is the subject of a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. The film tells the little-known story of Rosenwald’s contribution to African-American culture and education. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The revelation came at a July 14 session at the national convention of the NAACP, which drew several thousand delegates to Philadelphia. Bethea was one of some 70 people who attended a screening of the film, “Rosenwald.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Julius Rosenwald had a great impact on my life, and I didn’t even know it,” said Bethea, now a vice principal at an elementary school in New Jersey. “This helps me put the pieces of the puzzle of my life together.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The philanthropy Rosenwald invested in African-American causes in the early 1900s changed the course of education for thousands of children in the rural South and helped foster the careers of prominent artists, including writer Langston Hughes, opera singer Marion Anderson and painter Jacob Lawrence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rosenwald, who made his fortune at the helm of Sears, Roebuck and Co., also provided seed money to build YMCAs for blacks in cities around the country. In addition, he developed a huge apartment complex in Chicago to help improve the living conditions for the masses who had migrated from the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,” Julian Bond, the renowned civil rights leader, says in the documentary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner told JTA that her new film on Rosenwald “celebrates the affinity between African-Americans and Jews” that started long before the civil rights movement and speaks to the powerful Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, or repairing the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner joined Bond and Rabbi David Saperstein, the former head of the Reform movement’s Religious Action Center who now serves as U.S. ambassador at large for International Religious Freedom, for a discussion after the screening at the NAACP conference. It was while attending a public program 12 years ago on Martha’s Vineyard at which Bond and Saperstein discussed black-Jewish relations that Kempner first learned of Rosenwald’s work with African-Americans. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR She calls this film the last of a trilogy documenting the lives of “under-known Jewish heroes.” The first two were about baseball legend Hank Greenberg and radio and TV personality Gertrude Berg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Interspersing archival footage with interviews with prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), both of whom attended Rosenwald schools, the documentary tracks the ascent of Rosenwald, the son of German immigrants who rose to become one of the most powerful businessmen and philanthropists in early 20th-century America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His father, Sam, who came to America in 1851, began, like so many Jewish immigrants of his time, as a peddler. He eventually settled in Springfield, Illinois, where Julius grew up across the street from Abraham Lincoln’s home. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1878, his parents sent the 16-year-old Julius to New York to apprentice with his uncles in the men’s clothing manufacturing business. He returned to Illinois to start his own manufacturing company, and through some business and family connections ultimately partnered with Richard Sears, one of the founders of Sears, Roebuck and Co. After Rosenwald took over the company in 1908, it became the largest retailer in the country. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Outside his business life, Rosenwald was heavily influenced by his rabbi, Emil Hirsch, the spiritual leader of the Chicago Sinai Congregation, and he became a major benefactor of Jewish causes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film’s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film’s historians document the parallels Rosenwald drew at the time between the pogroms against European Jews and violent attacks on blacks in America. He was particularly moved by the race riots in 1908 in Springfield, which are said to have sparked the founding of the NAACP. Hirsch was one of the original leaders of the NAACP, and Rosenwald sponsored its first meetings at his temple. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He was also influenced by the writings of Booker T. Washington, a prominent black leader at the time, and became a funder of Washington’s Tuskegee University in Alabama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When Rosenwald gave a $25,000 gift to Tuskegee, Washington suggested taking a few thousand dollars to build six schools for young children. Until then, most black children didn’t attend school, but instead spent their time working in the fields alongside their parents. The few schools that did exist were primitive shacks staffed mostly by untrained teachers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rather than donating all the money for the schools, Rosenwald gave one-third of the funds needed and challenged the local black community to raise another third and the local white community to contribute the rest. In the end, some 5,300 schools were built with seed money from the Rosenwald Fund. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund ‘was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The fund soon switched focus and began supporting promising black artists, helping catapult dozens onto the national stage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Rosenwald Fund “was the single-most important funding agency for African- American culture in the 20th century,” poet Rita Dove says in the film. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kempner calls Rosenwald one of the greatest examplars of American Jewish philanthropy and says she hopes her film – whose official opening in theaters is scheduled for mid-August — will motivate others to continue that tradition. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Not all of us can be Julius Rosenwald,” she said, noting that he gave away a total of $62 million in his lifetime, but “we can all do something.”\nPassage 3:\nScreenshot from the Rosenwald documentary Julius Rosenwald stands with black American students who attended one of over 5,000 schools he built for African-American students in the 20th century. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the trailer for the documentary Rosenwald, civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) describes the type of school he went to as a child. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was a little school a short distance from my home—walking distance. Beautiful little building. It was a Rosenwald school. It was the only school we had,\" Lewis said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Rosenwald school—named after Julius Rosenwald, a 20th-century Jewish philanthropist who made his fortune by co-founding the department store we refer to today as Sears. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer, released exclusively by The Root, describes how Rosenwald was a relentless businessman but was also deeply inspired by the works and racial-equality teachings of Booker T. Washington. Or, more specifically, Washington's emphasis on what a solid education could do for the racially disadvantaged in America. So much so that Rosenwald teamed up with Washington, and together they hatched a plan to build over 5,000 schools for black students in the Jim Crow South. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It was a pretty important endeavor, since segregation prohibited blacks from attending the all-white schools in many Southern states. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The late poet Maya Angelou appears in the documentary, which is slated to be released in New York Aug. 14, and the rest of the nation throughout the fall. Angelou spoke about one of the schools she attended as a child, a school that was also built by Rosenwald. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thought my school was grand. It was the Lafayette County Training School,\" Angelou said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Civil rights and education-reform activist Julian Bonds is also a product of a Rosenwald school. He explained the significance of a Jewish man in the middle of the 20th century committing himself so vehemently to the idea that black American children must be educated. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist, who did not have to care about black people but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" Bonds said.\n", "answers": ["Julius Rosenwald is well known as the 20th-century American businessman who co-founded what we now call Sears. But a new documentary by Aviva Kempner explores Rosenwald's lesser-known role as a Jewish philanthropist who brought education to thousands of African-American children at a time when most had no schools to attend, reports the Root. \"It's a wonderful story of cooperation between this philanthropist who did not have to care about black people, but who did, and who expended his considerable wealth in ensuring that they got their fair shake in America,\" civil rights leader Julian Bond explains in Rosenwald, out next month. It tells of Rosenwald's rise from the son of a peddler to a clothing manufacturing apprentice to CEO of the largest US retailer, Sears, Roebuck & Co., in 1908, reports the Times of Israel. It was around that time he began to see similarities between the treatment of blacks in America and pogroms against European Jews. When his rabbi became an NAACP leader, Rosenwald sponsored meetings. Soon after, he donated $25,000 to Alabama's Tuskegee University, led by Booker T. Washington, whose writings on racial equality and education had piqued his interest. Washington suggested the money go toward building six schools for black children, but Rosenwald contributed just a third of the funds and pushed the black and white communities to raise the rest. He went on to give $62 million to various causes, including the Rosenwald Fund, which created 5,300 schools in the South, attended by prominent African-Americans like Maya Angelou, George Wolfe, and Eugene Robinson. It \"was the single-most important funding agency for African-American culture in the 20th century,\" poet Rita Dove says.

That mission is accomplished. What girls need now is encouragement to become leaders. It's time to take them to the C-suite, where the corporate chiefs work. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hewlett Packard CEO and President Meg Whitman smiles as she speaks at a conference on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif. on March 9. Op-ed contributor Jennifer Allyn argues: 'Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders.' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Today marks the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The event, which now includes our sons too, is still a valuable chance to help children understand the workplace. But the problems that face girls and women have changed in the past two decades, and it’s time for the day’s emphasis to change, too. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR What we need now is Take Our Daughters to the C-Suite Day – the offices occupied by corporate \"chiefs.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Twenty years ago, the Ms. Foundation launched the program to demystify the workplace for girls and inspire them to embrace a wide range of careers. Now that women represent half the US workforce, we can fairly say that mission has been accomplished. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up just 3.6 percent of CEOs, 14 percent of executive officers, and 16 percent of board directors. Companies need to do much more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on what Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg calls an “ambition gap.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies that are already committing time and resources to Take Our Children to Work Day can help close that gap by shifting their focus in three ways: introducing girls to female role models; more clearly explaining what leaders of both genders actually do; and supporting programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Introducing girls to a company’s highest ranking women is an easy step any organization can add to their career day programs – and it’s one that can make a huge difference. Marie Wilson, founder of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, often quotes child-rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman on this topic: “You can’t be what you can’t see.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls want to see role models: A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent had not been offered the opportunity to see these women in action at the workplace. Boys, in contrast, see a variety of male leaders in all aspects of their lives. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Companies can help girls by using the day to introduce their employees’ daughters to women at the highest level of the company. And highlighting these leaders’ accomplishments will give the women themselves more visibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Girls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis. The more they understand the specific requirements and rewards of leadership, the better choices they can make about their own careers. How do executives motivate teams, solve complex financial problems, and develop new products? Making the responsibilities, roles, and payoffs of leadership clear from the time girls are in grade-school would help make leadership more tangible. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It would also help resolve another issue the Girl Scouts identified: More than a third of girls said they wouldn’t feel comfortable trying to lead, and nearly 40 percent didn’t think they were cut out for leadership. Hearing directly from both male and female leaders about what they actually do could help close that gap. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Finally, these efforts need to reach beyond a single day in April. Companies and schools need proactive efforts to move women into leadership roles. That’s what Princeton University did when it found that the number of female students winning top academic honors and holding visible leadership roles had declined over the last decade.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I thought it was ridiculous. I couldn’t believe it!” Luke told the Daily News Wednesday.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR New York Daily News Shaneice Luke received this bill for $11,672,701.66. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The number is mind-boggling.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The city medical examiner ruled the death a homicide in December 2012, citing evidence that Rose died from injuries caused by being physically restrained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Luke’s attorneys said their investigation showed that the 5-foot-7, 175-pound Rose was restrained in a dangerous prone position for up to 30 minutes by three staffers, including a 275-pound worker who sat on him.

(AP) — Two years after a 33-year-old mentally disabled man died at a state institution in Queens, and one year after his sister filed a lawsuit accusing the staff of killing him, New York officials have sent her an $11.67 million bill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The claim against Rasheen Rose's estate cited his total Medicaid assistance from Aug. 6, 2002, through Aug. 6, 2012, the day he died.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Not doing so would be a violation and could put federal Medicaid funding at risk,\" spokeswoman Jennifer O'Sullivan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Medicaid, a state and federal program for the poor, doesn't typically demand reimbursement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But Ilann Maazel, an attorney who has filed lawsuits against the state after others died in state care, said other claim notices recently have been sent to families suing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is something new we're seeing ... and it's problematic,\" he said Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg, an advocate for the disabled whose adult son gets state-funded residential care, called it \"retaliation\" and \"an outrage\" to send the bill to someone who lost a loved one from abusive care. \"They're going to punish these people because they brought it to view of justice,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The New York medical examiner concluded Rose's death was a homicide and that he \"became unresponsive\" while being restrained at Fineson Developmental Center. The Queens district attorney's office said it wasn't notified about the death until that homicide ruling was made four months later. Investigators found no criminal conduct but have left the case open, spokesman Kevin Ryan said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shaneice Luke, Rose's sister, is seeking unspecified punitive and other damages in a federal lawsuit. She alleges that at least three staff threw Rose to the ground and one sat on him, while other staff stood by. She also alleges a history of abuse at Fineson and failure by supervisors and the state to address that or to train staff properly. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Rasheen Rose did not receive care remotely associated with the amount of money collected by OPWDD for Rasheen Rose over the 10-year period,\" attorney Aaron DePass replied to the state agency on Luke's behalf. Because he was actually killed by his supposed caregivers, \"it is clear that the quality of care he received does not warrant any payment for services whatsoever,\" he wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In federal court papers, all seven staff named in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing, saying they acted within their professional judgment. The state attorney general and private lawyers are defending them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two years ago, a congressional oversight committee reported that New York's residential centers for the developmentally disabled like Fineson, which have largely emptied in an ongoing shift to community-based programs and group homes, cost Medicaid about $1.9 million a year for each patient.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The battery-powered toy is designed to slowly peck its way through the surrounding shell after the egg is rubbed, tapped and warmed, according to the lawsuit. But Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield filed the complaint, on behalf of a class of other affected people, against Hatchimals' parent company Spin Master after she says the toy she purchased did not hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk says in the lawsuit that she purchased the Hatchimal for approximately $50 on January 14 as a birthday gift for her daughter. She claims she and her daughter followed directions included in the package and the Hatchimal failed to hatch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk is suing for damages relating to Spin Master's \"deceptive business practices in selling Hatchimals,\" according to the lawsuit. Her attorney Mark Geragos, alleges that the company misrepresented the toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The product is defective and it's unfortunate for all those people because there was kind of a craze about it,\" Geragos told ABC News. \"They ought to rename it the 'bait and switch.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Geragos said Hedjuk was denied a refund or a product repair. The lawsuit also cites several negative reviews on Amazon.com from other consumers saying the toy was defective. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My guess is there will be more lawsuits filed any day,\" Geragos said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released Hatchimals, which retailed for $50 to $60, on October 7, 2016. But the popular toy often sold out, creating a market for resellers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"By November 2016, the products were difficult to find and sold out in many locations, which led to a black market for Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit alleges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Soon, Hatchimals were selling on e-commerce sites for hundreds of dollars, but many parents and children were allegedly let down after the item failed to live up to its name. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the lawsuit said. \"Since children do not know what is inside of the egg,\" the lawsuit alleges that according to a Spin Master senior vice president,\"they get excited about what they may get.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit goes onto to say, \"This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The lawsuit also alleges that Spin Master has failed to take \"proper action to address its malfunctioning product.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After receiving complaints that the toy didn't hatch, the company posted onto Facebook that they are \"100% committed to bringing the magic of Hatchimals\" to all of its customers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement to ABC News in December, the company said that while \"the vast majority of children have had a magical experience with Hatchimals,\" it also acknowledged it had received calls from consumers who had \"encountered challenges\" and that, \"To ensure all queries receive a timely response, we have increased the number of Consumer Care representatives, extended our hours, and increased the capacity for callers in the queue to help prevent calls dropped due to the holiday volume.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have also created troubleshooting tips on Hatchimals.com and a video with 'The Top 5 Things to Know About Hatchimals',\" the December statement continued. \"We are committed to doing everything possible to resolve any consumer issues.

Now, that disappointment has led to legal action. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jodie Hejduk of Bakersfield, California, has filed a class-action lawsuit against Spin Master, alleging the Hatchimal toy she purchased for her daughter never hatched. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that start out inside a spotted plastic egg, and are supposed to hatch when the owner rubs the shell. That process should take 25 to 40 minutes, according to Spin Master's website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't the case for \"millions of families throughout this country,\" Hejduk said in her lawsuit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Millions of children and families across the globe were sourly disappointed with coal in their stockings, in the form of a bait-and-switch marketing scheme perpetrated by Spin Master, the manufacturers of this Christmas season's 'it' gift, Hatchimals,\" the lawsuit says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Spin Master knew that the 'hatching' was one of the primary draws of the toy,\" the suit continued. \"One of the company's senior vice presidents recognized that getting the toy to hatch 'resonates well with kids' and that since children do not know what is inside of the egg 'they get excited about what they may get.' This excitement was replaced with extreme disappointment for the many children when their Hatchimals did not hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A Hatchimal cost about $50, depending on the retailer. However, the part-Furby, part-Tamagotchi toys were popular on the resale market, where they sold for upward of $250. Many parents lined up outside Toys R Us and Wal-Mart stores to purchase the highly sought-after toy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, once children opened their Christmas presents, the buzz surrounding the toys quickly turned from, \"Where do I find one?\" to \"This thing doesn't hatch.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I paid triple the price so I could get my 5 yr. old daughter what she wanted but when it was time to play with it the Hatchimal would not respond inside the egg. We watched every YouTube video we could for help, but to no avail ... we had to open it ourselves,\" one customer wrote on Amazon.com, according to the lawsuit.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Update: This story has been updated to include comment from Spin Master\nPassage 4:\nFRESNO, Calif. (CN) – A federal class action claims that Hatchimals, the nationwide toy craze that hatches from an egg, don’t always hatch, producing unhappiness in families that the filing attorney says can range from “extreme disappointment to tragic.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals are stuffed animals that hatch out of the colored spotted eggs they are sold in. The creature inside is a mystery, making kids excited to see what they may get. The hatching is the toy’s signature attraction, according to the Jan. 19 lawsuit against Spin Master Corp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master released the toys in early October 2016, in time for the holidays, and they quickly became the year’s must-have gift. By November they were hard to find. Some parents waited for hours outside toy stores; others paid up to seven times the retail price eBay and other internet sites. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hatchimals typically sold for $50 to $60. They were advertised Monday morning for $79.99 on the Toys Are U website, and for $59.99 on the Wal-Mart website, which, however, was out of stock. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master made an estimated $100 million in profits off the toy, attorney Ben Meiselas said in an interview, but investigations indicate that its failure rate is exceptionally high. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This was an aggressive and brilliant marketing campaign built on a house of cards and lies for a product that was not ready for the market,” Meiselas said. “Spin Master knew it was spinning consumers; they knew the product didn’t hatch.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He noted the irony of the company’s name: Spin Master. Stories told by families who bought the toy “border on extreme disappointment to tragic, depending on different families’ situations and their ability to purchase these expensive items,” said Meiselas, of Geragos & Geragos in Los Angeles. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “They were playing on the most visceral emotions of a family: a child’s happiness. It exceeds a mere letdown and caused real damages.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many consumers who tried to solve the problem by contacting Spin Master hit a brick wall, as customer service never returned their calls or messages, “with some customers reporting being on hold for as long as three hours before having their call disconnected,” the complaint states, citing a Dec. 28 article in Global News. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lead plaintiff Jodie Hejduk seeks to represent both a California class and a national class, though Meiselas says his office has been getting calls from people around the world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We want Spin Master to stop the spin, be a responsible corporate citizen, and redress the damages to consumers, or it’s headed to a jury of moms and dads, husbands and wives, who will decide whether the product was fraudulent. We think they will,” Meiselas said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said he hopes the class action sends a message to other corporations “looking to exploit the average consumer saving money to buy their kids a gift not to sell a defective product that hits Americans in the pocketbook.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk, who snagged one of the coveted toys for her daughter’s birthday, says her daughter was thrilled to get it, but “dismayed” when it never hatched, though she followed the instructions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other parents have written scathing reviews on Amazon.com and on the Toys R Us website. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master promised to address the issues, but the few remedial measures it took were ineffective, according to the 25-page complaint. Hejduk says the company should have recalled the toys or issued refunds, but it did neither. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Spin Master did not return emailed requests for comment on Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Hejduk seeks class certification, a recall, restitution with interest, and compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for consumer law violations, unfair competition, false advertising, breach of warranty and unjust enrichment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In its report, the team also concluded that while the site where the wreck was found \"is located in the general area where one would expect to find the Santa Maria based on contemporary accounts of Columbus's first voyage, it is further away from shore than one should expect\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A metal tube Mr Clifford had seen during a 2003 expedition and thought to be a lombard, or cannon, was no longer at the site, the experts said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'No trace' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the Americas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Documents from the time suggest it ran aground on a reef or sandbank off the northern shore of Haiti on the night of 24 to 25 December 1492. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to these historical sources, Columbus told his crew to strip timbers from the ship to build an outpost or fort nearby, leaving sailors behind while he returned to Spain. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By the time Columbus returned the following year, the fort had been burned down and the crew members had disappeared. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The wreck of the Santa Maria was never found. The Unesco experts said it could have been buried by sediment over the past centuries or have been slowly worn down by the waves.\nPassage 2:\nThe initiative has been triggered by the underwater exploration work carried out off the north coast of Haiti by the American explorer Barry Clifford, who announced in May that he had discovered what might be Columbus' long-lost vessel. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco – which has now examined Clifford’s wreck – believes that it is not the Santa Maria, but that the real final resting place of Columbus' flagship could be relatively nearby. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Paris-based organization now plans to look for the Santa Maria in a number of different locations – some on land and others on the seabed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both the nature of Unesco’s outright rejection of Clifford’s site, and some of the organisation’s proposed alternatives, are likely to prove controversial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR An official Unesco report issued today largely ignores 11-year-old photographic evidence for what could be Columbus-era cannon on the site. The cannon have tragically been looted since the photographs were taken but some of the world’s top experts in early ordnance who have looked at the photos believe that they are 15th or 16th century weapons, sometimes known as lombards. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report also ignores crucial evidence from an expedition which almost certainly visited the site in 1960. It also admits that no tests, which could have revealed the geographical origin of the vessel, have been carried out on the ballast from the wreck. Likewise no detailed analysis has been carried out on the bronze objects found on the site – tests which might have revealed the objects’ ages. Neither does the report really assess in any detail the case for there potentially being two wrecks, one early and one later, on the site, rather than just one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bronze items – a number of ship construction fasteners – is the main reason for rejecting it as the Santa Maria. Unesco says that ship construction fasteners only came into use in the late 17th century, a belief based mainly on the fact that such fasteners have apparently not been found so far on earlier wrecks. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Very significantly, Unesco also seems to have moved towards the belief that the Santa Maria may be buried under sediments on what used to be seabed and is now coastal marshland. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many scholars are likely to be very critical of any plan Unesco has to look for the Santa Maria in those marshes, because, they argue, Columbus's vessel could not have reached them due to some shallow and dangerous reefs. Unesco’s only argument for looking on land, and one of only two arguments for rejecting Mr Clifford’s site, is a short very ambiguous passage in an edited version of Columbus’ diary. Sadly only edited versions survive. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco seems to think that the remains of the Santa Maria could be buried in one of two areas of marshland along the North coast of Haiti, near the small town of En Bas Saline, or alternatively near La Petite Anse. The official Unesco report says that “the Santa Maria might indeed now” lie “under coastal sediment”. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A painting of the ‘Santa Maria’ caught in a storm off the coast of Hispaniola in 1492 (Alamy) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It added: “To better estimate the location of the wreck of the Santa Maria, it will be important to understand more precisely the geomorphological evolution of the coastline.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Unesco report may also have implications for the US public’s perception of the organisation; America’s relationship with Unesco is currently very poor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The United States has refused to pay its set financial contribution to Unesco for the past three years – and last year the organisation stripped America of its Unesco voting rights. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria saga could potentially further damage relations, or at least public attitudes, because a senior US underwater archaeologist, Professor Charles Beeker of Indiana University, who had been conducting a preliminary investigation of the site earlier this year at the request of Barry Clifford, has been refused permission to continue his work. What was in effect a US-led investigation has been more or less killed off by Unesco, and replaced by a partly European team. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unesco has officially advised the Haitian government against accepting the US archaeological team’s proposal because “in its current state” it “lacked many elements required for the appropriate underwater archaeological research on the concerned site”, and because it “did not conform\" to the organisation's standards on the protection of underwater cultural heritage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Santa Maria was the flagship of Christopher Columbus’ three-vessel fleet which discovered the New World. The fleet first reached the Americas on 12 October 1492 when they sighted the Bahamas. 75 days later, at around midnight, while Columbus was asleep, the Santa Maria drifted onto a reef and could not be refloated. Within a few hours the ship’s seams began to open – and the interior of the vessel was flooded. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Christopher Columbus hired the ship in 1492 and sailed in it from southern Spain’s Atlantic coast in search of a new western route to Asia (Rex) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, Columbus and his crew were made welcome by a local Taino chieftain. Columbus then established a fort, left a garrison of 39 men there, and returned to report his discoveries to the King and Queen of Spain. Later in 1493, he returned to his fort in Haiti – but it had been destroyed and the garrison had all died or been killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In an official statement, Unesco said that \"the evidence collected concerning the location, nature and artifact content\" of the site has been \"subjected to thorough investigation by an acclaimed team of experts\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Professor Beeker still thinks that Clifford’s site is of potential importance. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think that Mr. Clifford’s site is still the best candidate yet proposed for the wreck of the Santa Maria,” he said. “I am not saying that it is definitely Columbus’ flagship, but without a more thorough and comprehensive investigation, the site cannot be discounted.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But even if it ultimately turns out not to be the right site, all the historical and other evidence points to the vessel having been wrecked in that immediate area – certainly within just a few hundred metres of Clifford’s site. Unfortunately Unesco’s ideas as to where the wreck of the Santa Maria may lie are extremely flawed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Their suggestion that it could lie on what is now land is not consistent with contemporary accounts suggesting the wreck’s considerable distance from the shore. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “In my view it would have been impossible for the Santa Maria to drift onto what is now land – because the vessel would have been wrecked on the reef before getting that far, which is precisely what happened. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The bronze fasteners are a puzzle – but not sufficient reason on their own to dismiss the site without detailed investigation. There are a number of possible explanations for the presence of those bronze objects. The fact that bronze fasteners have not yet been documented on the few known early Iberian Atlantic shipwrecks does not mean that there were no such ships from that time period that used bronze fasteners. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Mr Clifford has triggered very substantial renewed international interest in finding Columbus’ lost flagship – a vessel which represented the start of continuous contact between the old and new worlds, and one if not the most important event in world history.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reacting to the Unesco report, Mr Clifford, said: “It is essential that Unesco investigates the entire area where the lombard cannons were. I would be delighted to assist them and look forward to them getting in touch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The lombards are the smoking guns and, in my view, the most important pieces of evidence in the search for the Santa Maria,” he said.\n", "answers": ["The United Nations' cultural body is on the trail of Christopher Columbus' flagship—and it says the wreck that an expedition identified as the Santa Maria earlier this year is a different, much younger ship. As predicted by authorities in Haiti, UNESCO experts say there is \"indisputable proof\" that the wreck found off the country's north coast is from a much later period than 1492, reports the BBC. UNESCO says the wreck is further from shore than accounts of Columbus' first voyage, and bronze or copper fasteners found at the site are evidence of shipbuilding techniques that date the ship to the late 17th or 18th century at the earliest. UNESCO says it believes the wreck may lie \"under coastal sediment\" in what is now marshland and has called for further investigation of the area.

Instead, Markham bought soy formula to supplement her breast milk. When she didn't show up at the hospital, police came to her house, and she told them she wanted a second doctor's opinion and stressed that she did not want her son getting formula from animal products.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n14:35 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Guardian Moscow correspondent Shaun Walker writes: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Vladimir Putin is likely to count the format and tone of his long meeting with Donald Trump as a win – even if nothing much of substance was discussed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russia’s election hacking was raised during the meeting, but it does not appear to have taken top billing. US secretary of state Rex Tillerson said Trump was “rightly focused on how do we move forward” from the issue, while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov even claimed Trump had told Putin he accepted the Russian leader’s denials of involvement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Setting up a working group on non-interference in future elections – as Tillerson said had been agreed – is hardly likely to reassure those in Washington worried about Russia’s actions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A trustworthy account of exactly how the meeting went down is unlikely to surface: another win for Putin was the makeup of the room. In addition to the two presidents, the only people present were the respective foreign ministers and two translators. This means there is no chance of leaks, as happened when Lavrov visited the White House in May and it later emerged that Trump had shared sensitive intelligence with the Russians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The personalised format of the meeting excluded those in Trump’s team who are more sceptically minded on Russia, such as national security adviser HR McMaster, and Trump’s senior Russia adviser Fiona Hill, a longstanding Russia expert. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Russian television emphasised the length of the meeting, which ran more than four times over its scheduled half-hour length, as a sign of Russia’s importance. The news of a US-Russia agreement on a ceasefire in southwestern Syria, announced as the meeting was ongoing, is an example of the kind of top-table diplomacy Putin would like to do with Trump. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Putin looked impassive, but he would have been smiling inside. As journalists were hurried out of the room, Putin appeared to gesture to Trump and ask if these journalists were the ones who had insulted Trump, laughing at his own joke. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Presumably Putin had been briefed that a disdain for supposed “fake news” would be a promising area of potential common ground with the US president.\nPassage 2:\nUploaded on Jul 7, 2017 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin were filmed meeting and shaking hands at the G20 summit in Hamburg on Friday, in footage posted on the German government’s official Facebook page NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR View the video at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/v...\nPassage 3:\nFILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a news conference at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia, on January 17, 2017 and U.S. President Donald Trump seen at a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 20, 2017, as seen in this combination photo.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump has said he wants to find ways to work with Putin, a goal made more difficult by sharp differences over Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine, and allegations Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That means every facial expression and physical gesture will be analyzed as much as any words the two leaders utter. The Kremlin said the two enjoyed a passing handshake at the summit ahead of the talks later in the day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders, including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss,\" Trump wrote in a tweet on Friday. \"I will represent our country well and fight for its interests!\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The meeting is scheduled for 3:45 p.m. local time, shortly after a G20 working session on climate and energy begins. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump, who has angered world leaders with his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change, will likely have to leave that session early to make the Russia meeting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some fear the Republican president, a political novice whose team is still developing its Russia policy, will be less prepared for their sit-down than Putin, who has dealt with the last two U.S. presidents and scores of other world leaders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There's nothing ... the Kremlin would like to see more than a (U.S.) president who will settle for a grip and a grin and walk away saying that he had this fabulous meeting with the Kremlin autocrat,\" Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on MSNBC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As investigations at home continue into whether there was any collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, the U.S. president has come under pressure to take a hard line against the Kremlin. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Moscow has denied any interference and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Thursday, Trump won praise from at least one Republican hawk in the U.S. Congress after his speech in Warsaw in which he urged Russia to stop its \"destabilizing activities\" and end its support for Syria and Iran. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This is a great start to an important week of American foreign policy,\" said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has often been critical of Trump on security issues. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But earlier in the day, Trump declined to say definitively whether he believed U.S. intelligence officials who have said that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think it was Russia but I think it was probably other people and/or countries, and I see nothing wrong with that statement. Nobody really knows. Nobody really knows for sure,” Trump said at a news conference, before accusing Democratic former President Barack Obama of not doing enough to tackle hacking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR SENATORS' CONCERNS NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ahead of Trump’s meeting with Putin, three U.S. senators wrote to Trump to express “deep concern” about reports that his administration planned to discuss the return to Russia of diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York that were seized by the Obama administration last year in response to alleged Russian election meddling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Republican Senators Johnny Isakson and Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen said returning the facilities would \"embolden\" Putin and encourage further efforts by Russia to interfere in Western elections. All three are on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The White House declined to offer details on what Trump would request of Putin and what he might offer in exchange for cooperation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump wanted to talk about how the two countries can work together to stabilize war-ravaged Syria. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The United States is prepared to explore the possibility of establishing with Russia joint mechanisms for ensuring stability, including no-fly zones, on-the-ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance,\" Tillerson said before leaving the United States to join Trump in Germany. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Trump was also grappling with a response to North Korea's successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which analysts say had a long enough range to reach Alaska. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Curbing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions has been Trump's most pressing foreign policy priority, and he met with leaders from Japan and South Korea on Thursday evening to discuss it. He is also slated to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I’d like to see the president figure out how to engage Russia on North Korea,” said Representative Francis Rooney, a Republican from Florida who is on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"What I suggested to the president here a while back was that since we have all these conflicting issues about Russia right now and we’re still reeling from the fact that they took Crimea, maybe this is an opportunity to reset the Russia relationship in a positive manner,” Rooney said in an interview.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A massive missing persons search for the little girl ensued. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police were suspicious of what Anthony, then 22, was telling them.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On July 16, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of child neglect. Her attorney was an unknown Florida lawyer named Jose Baez. A Florida grand jury indicted Anthony on capital murder charges October 14, 2008.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I was offended by it. I was offended by the fact that he wasn't being treated fairly. I didn't know Baez. I had never met him,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Baez started asking Mason, a Florida death penalty qualified attorney, for advice. That propelled Mason to want to meet Anthony. He remembers going to the Orange County jail to introduce himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They brought her to the room, and I have to tell you I was really surprised to see how small she is ... how tiny she is. I stood looking at a child herself. I said this can't be,\" he said.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Could she look you in the eye?\" I asked. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Oh yes,\" Mason responded, describing her demeanor as quiet, afraid and unsure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After that meeting, with Anthony's approval, Mason decided to join the team pro bono. He said the unpaid time he spent on the case \"was well over a million dollars\" and cost him tens of thousands of dollars out-of-pocket. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said in the years before trial, he normally met with Anthony in a lunch room at the jail. The jail would clear everyone out before Anthony came in. A stationary video camera in the room was positioned on their conversations, so he and Anthony would cover their mouths and speak in low tones to each other, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shortly before jury selection was to begin, Mason got word that Anthony's handwritten letters describing sexual abuse at the hands of her father were going to be made public under Florida's open records law.

I turned sideways a little bit, he clapped his hands down on his thighs -- let out a big sigh but didn't say anything,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He never admitted doing anything,\" Mason said. \"All we had were the letters and (separately) the statements Casey had made to the psychiatrist.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Next it was Cindy Anthony's turn. \"We called Mom in, Cindy, and told her and she immediately welled up with emotion, cried, was very upset,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once a jury was selected it was time for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Baez gave the opening statements. In the midst of telling the jury what the evidence would show, he delivered a bombshell that turned the case on its head by telling the jury that his client was a victim of sexual abuse by her father. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The country was stunned and so was Mason, who was sitting next to Anthony in the courtroom. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I didn't know that he was going to say that. We had talked about all aspects of it, and I did not know. I don't know if anybody knew that he was going to say that other than himself,\" Mason recalled. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR I asked Mason if he was concerned the defense would not be able to establish this with evidence as promised during the opening statement. Mason said he was. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, I was concerned about that because I knew we didn't have the ability to prove that unless George got on the stand and confessed,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecution responded by making George Anthony its first witness. The first question Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton asked him was whether he had sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony responded with a definitive no. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trial went on for weeks. Witness after witness took the stand for the prosecution in the largely circumstantial case. They finally rested their case on June 15, 2011. Then it was the defense's turn. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. They said the child drowned in the Anthony's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father panicked upon finding her there and covered up the death. George Anthony denied that in his testimony. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Casey Anthony: 'I didn't kill my daughter' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the midst of the defense case, Mason described how out-of-court conversations with the prosecution suddenly turned to possible plea discussions. Anthony was approached with the possibility. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey got very angry about that. She got very angry to hear talk about it. She didn't want to hear it.\" Mason said. \"Casey would fight it 'til her last breath. She didn't kill her daughter.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said he believes it took a lot of courage and strength for Anthony to end any talk of a plea agreement. She knew what was at stake in this death penalty trial. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So, plea discussions were stopped in their tracks, Mason said, and the trial went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Then, on July 5, 2011, after deliberating for 10 hours, jurors announced they had reached a verdict. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She was holding her breath like a deep sea diver, waiting as we all were,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony was acquitted by the 12-person jury on the most serious charges, including first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the jury convicted her on four misdemeanors of providing false information to law enforcement officers. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony now lives in an undisclosed location in Florida and doesn't go out of the home she is living in because of the public hate and continued threats to her life, Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"She has to live constantly on guard. She can't go out in public,\" Mason said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By her own choice, she works inside the home, Mason said, and is living as \"a housekeeper, clerk, secretary and stuff like that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I think Casey has a lot of world left to have to deal with. She hasn't been freed from her incarceration yet 'cause she can't go out. She can't go to a beauty parlor, she can't go shopping to a department store, she can't go to a restaurant, she can't even go to McDonald's. She can't do anything,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason and his wife, Shirley, have continued a relationship with Anthony. Now three years after being acquitted, Mason said Anthony still distrusts the outside world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Casey is aloof,\" Mason said. \"She is kind of, I think, afraid of people ... she's not real close to. We've had a couple of occasions to have social gatherings that can include her -- close friends, the (legal) team. She still likes to back away from the middle.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 2012: Anthony's 'video diary' surfaces NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"does not have any blood family anymore,\" Mason said. The family she has is the residual of the defense team, Dorothy Clay Sims, Lisabeth Fryer and Mason's wife. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason said although there may have been a few conversations between Anthony and her mother in recent years, there is no relationship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as for a relationship with her father? \"None,\" Mason said emphatically. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Shirley Mason has also gotten to know Anthony over the past three years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I'm a cross between a friend, a mother, but not a mother -- only someone who is older who has had experience in the world she has not had,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mason gives Anthony advice, but also listens to her when they talk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"My hope for her is it gets better for her and the world or the people who have been so hateful can let that go and they can move on,\" she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Anthony \"tries to make her life work,\" Shirley Mason said. She takes care of herself and stays physically fit by working out in the house. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I do think she wants to speak out,\" Mason said. Anthony declined CNN's request for an interview. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have never asked her that, but I know she has very strong feelings for what has happened to her.

At their core, the Games are about the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. They are about fair play and human spirit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nobody has epitomised these values more at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 than runners Abbey D’Agostino (USA) and Nikki Hamblin (NZL) and, beyond the Games, the Norwegian men’s handball team. The International Fair Play Committee (CIFP), with the support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), presented them with Fair Play awards today at the Olympic Club in the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro for two separate acts of selflessness and exemplary sportsmanship. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The D’Agostino and Hamblin story is one of humanity and sacrifice which has already captured the hearts of people across the globe. New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin tripped and fell to the ground during the 5,000m race, accidentally bringing American D’Agostino down behind her with around 2,000m to go. The 24-year-old D’Agostino was quick to get up again, yet instead of carrying on with her race she stopped to help the stricken Hamblin to her feet, encouraging her to join her in attempting to finish the race. However, during her tumble, D’Agostino suffered an ankle injury, slowing the runner down, but Hamblin sportingly hung back to in return offer her encouragements. The two women went on to complete the race together.

The match was tied when at the last minute the German team scored a goal. It was discovered that when the goal had been scored an extra player had come onto the field. Although the Norwegian team had every right to file a protest, after much deliberation, they finally opted not to contest the results as they felt that the additional player on the field, though illegal, did not partake in the activities that helped the German team score the final goal. Germany went on to qualify for the Olympics, while the Norwegians did not.

A third Olympian, Sydney bronze medalist Jamie Dantzscher, has also said she was abused by Nassar. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Lansing State Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, more than 140 women have alleged sexual abuse by Nassar, under the guise of medical treatment.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It doesn’t matter if you’re the Olympic champion or you’re an 8-year-old that goes to gymnastics in Ohio, or wherever you are in the United States,” Raisman said in a joint interview with USA TODAY Sports and The Associated Press in August, when she and her Final Five teammates from Rio were inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

It should have never ever happened and I think that needs to be discussed more.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last month, Maroney came forward in a Twitter post, saying Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar abused her until she left the sport, Maroney wrote, adding, \"It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was 'treated.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Maroney said Nassar abused her before the U.S. team won gold in the 2012 Olympics and before she won silver on vault.

Attorneys have said that more women are expected to join the lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is not known whether Raisman or Maroney are part of those lawsuits. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Nassar has already pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and is in jail, awaiting a Dec. 7 sentencing in that case.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nCHAMPION, Wis. — In France, the shrine at Lourdes is surrounded by hundreds of hotels and has received as many as 45,000 pilgrims in a single day. Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico, draws millions of fervent worshipers a year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Now, a little chapel among the dairy farms here, called Our Lady of Good Help, has joined that august company in terms of religious status, if not global fame. This month, it became one of only about a dozen sites worldwide, and the first in the United States, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary have been officially validated by the Roman Catholic Church. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1859, the year after Mary is said to have appeared in Lourdes, a Belgian immigrant here named Adele Brise said she was visited three times by Mary, who hovered between two trees in a bright light, clothed in dazzling white with a yellow sash around her waist and a crown of stars above her flowing blond locks. As instructed, Ms. Brise devoted her life to teaching Catholic beliefs to children. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Dec. 8, after a two-year investigation by theologians who found no evidence of fraud or heresy and a long history of shrine-related conversions, cures and other signs of divine intervention, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay declared “with moral certainty” that Ms. Brise did indeed have encounters “of a supernatural character” that are “worthy of belief.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lourdes-like hordes have not yet gathered, but since the weighty decree a growing stream of visitors, some driving several hours, has found its way here to pray and revel in what many say is the palpable presence of Mary. Calls are coming in from as far as New York from church groups that want to visit by the busload, and local church officials are wondering whether they thought too small when they built a new parking lot — planned well before this month — with 75 spaces. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Debbie Banda, 46, and her mother, Mary Young, 75, who live nearby, learned of the shrine and the bishop’s decision from the news, and came for the first time on Wednesday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s incredible — she’s here, you just feel it,” Ms. Banda said after praying in the crypt chapel, said to be on the spot of the apparitions. As they passed a statue of Mary in white, just as described by Ms. Brise, Ms. Banda was overcome with emotion, weeping and hugging her mother. The two of them went back to pray some more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We need the Virgin Mary’s protection, and for her to keep an eye on our soldiers, too,” said Ms. Young, whose sons have served in the Middle East. “We’ll definitely be coming back.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Catholic leaders described the decree in Wisconsin as a bolt of joy at a trying time for the Catholic church, which is troubled by revelations of sex abuse. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “This is a gift to the believers,” said the Rev. Johann Roten, director of the International Marian Research Institute at the University of Dayton. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It would be devious to say that this was somehow pulled out of the attic to exorcise the problems of the church today,” Father Roten said in a telephone interview. “But hopefully this will have a beneficial impact on the people, showing them that there are ways of living with faith that are very pure.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Diocese of Green Bay is under fire from lawyers in an abuse-related lawsuit, who charge that it has obstructed justice by destroying potentially incriminating files on former priests. The diocese says it has cooperated fully with law enforcement and discarded psychiatric records of deceased priests as required by federal privacy laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bishop Ricken, in an interview at his office in Green Bay, noted that the church has a tradition of taking its time with such cases. Over the years, he said, his predecessors had implicitly endorsed the shrine by holding services there and encouraging people to visit. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR When he moved to Green Bay in 2008, he said, “I was struck by how many stories I heard of answered prayers” — resolved family and employment problems as well as medical cures — and he decided to start a formal investigation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “People have a hunger for the spiritual, and right here in our backyard was a source to meet that need,” Bishop Ricken said. The church’s scandals did not influence his decision, he said, but if the shrine can become a source of hope and healing for people, including victims of errant priests, “that would be beautiful.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Vatican gives primary responsibility for evaluating apparitions to local bishops. Wary of fraud, the church is generally reluctant even to investigate claims. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Over the 20th century, some 386 major apparitions of Mary were reported at a level beyond local rumors, said Father Roten, who has been an investigator in purported sightings. About 75 of those were studied, and at most a dozen were recognized as valid, he said. Increasingly, he said, the church makes use of psychiatric examinations and brain scans to see if people making claims are mentally healthy and not having hallucinations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That kind of examination was not possible, of course, for Ms. Brise, and Bishop Ricken said that his panel of three theological specialists had considered a host of indirect factors in concluding that her sighting was credible, following guidelines set by the Vatican in 1978. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By all reports, he said, Ms. Brise was humble and honest and faithfully carried out Mary’s mandate to serve the church throughout her life. In one striking sign of a divine presence, he said, the shrine’s grounds and the terrified crowd who gathered there were spared the flames of the Great Peshtigo Fire of 1871, which devoured the surrounding lands and homes and caused more than 1,200 deaths. Her account of Mary’s apparition and message was consistent with accepted cases. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The dozens of families and individuals who stopped to pray at the shrine on Wednesday afternoon seemed to have no doubts at all about the apparitions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “There’s a lot of power here,” said Theresa Vandermause, 45, who for years has made a weekly pilgrimage to the shrine with her friend Judy Deprey, 65. “You can feel the presence of Mary, and it feels like she’s listening to you.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The two women were pleased that the church had finally declared Mary’s visits here to be real, but said that the decree had not really changed anything. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We knew that already!” they declared.\nPassage 2:\nIn 1859 our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, visited the young woman, Adele Brise. It was an unlikely visitation to a simple, humble country girl on a dirt road in the wooded countryside. Her instruction was seemingly simple but required the commitment of Adele’s life’s work: teach the children in the faith. When we pause to think about this, it is very profound. The Holy Mother did not appear in a crowded city or to people of wealth and power. Instead, she appeared to an unlikely person in an unlikely place. In doing so, she made it clear to all the world that there is no one anywhere who is beyond the reach of God’s generous love. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This is good news. And now it is both our obligation and privilege to pay it forward by celebrating that visit and opening that message to anyone and everyone who answers the call.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nLONDON (AP) — A Swedish doctor says four women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get pregnant. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR FILE - In this April 4, 2012 photo made available by the University of Goteborg in Sweden, the Swedish research team practices before the operations to transplant wombs at the Sahlgrenska Hospital in... (Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He would not say on Monday whether any of the women had succeeded. In all, nine women in Sweden have received new wombs since 2012, but two had to have them removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women received wombs donated by their mothers or other close relatives in an experimental procedure designed to test whether it's possible to transfer a uterus so a woman can give birth to her own biological child. The women had in vitro fertilization before the transplants, using their own eggs to make embryos. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Dr. Mats Brannstrom, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Goteburg, who is leading the research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry, and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There have been two previous attempts to transplant a womb — in Turkey and Saudi Arabia — but both failed to produce babies. Doctors in Britain and Hungary also are planning similar operations, but using wombs from women who had just died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom said any woman in the study who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The transplants are intended to benefit women unable to have children because they lost a uterus to cancer or were born without one. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Some doctors said women who got pregnant with a new uterus would have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby,\" said Dr. Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a gynecologist at Liverpool Women's Hospital. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a study published last week, Brannstrom and colleagues described the procedures used to transplant the nine wombs and said there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four patients. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Other experts called it a promising step but said it would be crucial that babies get enough nutrients from the mother's blood supply. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We really don't know if the blood flow to the uterus will increase and adapt in the same way,\" as in a regular pregnancy, said Dr. Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception unit at Guy's and St. Thomas' hospital in London. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It is a good sign they have done the (embryo) transfers,\" Khalaf said. \"But a live birth will be the best validation that this works.\"\nPassage 2:\nSwedish medical team hoping for world first as women born without uterus or who lost it to cancer get embryo transfers NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four of nine women given pioneering womb transplants in Sweden have now also had embryos transferred, the pioneering Swedish doctor treating them has said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Mats Brannstrom, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Gothenburg University, said his team had embarked on a programme of embryo transfer for the women, who were either born without a womb or lost it as a result of cancer. All have ovaries so were able to produce eggs that were fertilised using IVF. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the nine women might succeed in giving birth, which would be a world first. Other womb transplants have taken place in Saudi Arabia and Turkey but no recipients have yet managed to have a child. A pregnancy was achieved in Turkey, but it failed after two months. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We have already begun transferring embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others when they are ready,\" said Brannstrom. He would not say whether any of the women were pregnant at the moment. In a study published last week, the team said that there were \"mild rejection episodes\" in four women who received donated wombs. Two patients had to have the uterus removed because of complications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom's technique is controversial because he is accepting wombs donated by living women, who are relatives or friends of his patients. Elsewhere, wombs from dead donors have been used. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Richard Smith, head of the UK charity Womb Transplant UK, which is trying to raise money to carry out transplants here, has said that large chunks of blood vessels had to be removed from the donor as well as the uterus itself, raising the risks of the operation for the donor. In the UK, there would be ethical questions because the operation is not a life-saving procedure, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The women will have to take drugs throughout their pregnancy to ensure their body does not reject the organ. They will also have to be watched carefully for how the womb progresses throughout pregnancy. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dr Charles Kingsland, a spokesman for Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"There are questions about how the physiological changes in the uterus will affect the mother and whether the transplanted uterus will be conducive to a growing baby.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.\n", "answers": ["Swedish doctors are advancing in their quest to implant embryos in women who have received pioneering womb implants, the Guardian reports.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a wood-paneled dining room, with Picasso and de Kooning prints on the walls, Mr. Jones nervously presented a radical suggestion: the magazine, a leader of the revolution that helped take sex in America from furtive to ubiquitous, should stop publishing images of naked women. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Hefner, now 89, but still listed as editor in chief, agreed.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy magazine is to stop publishing images of naked women as part of its redesign, it has emerged. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Its US owners say the internet has made nudity outdated, and pornographic magazines are no longer so commercially viable, the New York Times reports. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000, official figures show. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR However, the magazine will still feature women in provocative poses - though not fully nude. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Battle won' NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The decision was apparently taken last month at a meeting attended by Playboy founder and current editor-in-chief Hugh Hefner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Magazine executives admitted that Playboy - which was founded in 1953 - had been overtaken by the changes it pioneered, according to the New York Times. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"That battle has been fought and won,\" Playboy chief executive Scott Flanders is quoted as saying by the newspaper. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passe at this juncture.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gone, too, are the days when interviews with figures of the stature of Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and Jimmy Carter made Playboy so culturally and politically significant, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in New York. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's website has already banished nudity, partly to give it access to social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. And its popularity has soared, with web traffic quadrupling. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A brand long synonymous with salaciousness is cleaning up its act, and all with the blessing - apparently - of the 89-year-old Mr Hefner, our correspondent adds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Image copyright AFP/Getty NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 60 years of Playboy NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy's logo showing a rabbit head wearing a bow tie is one of the most recognisable in the world. The company makes most of its money from licensing it around the world to sell products including toiletries, drinks and jewellery, including a necklace worn by the character Carrie Bradshaw in the TV series Sex and the City. About 40% of merchandising income is generated in China, where the magazine itself is not available. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the magazine's most famous interviews was a 1976 conversation with Jimmy Carter in which the then presidential candidate admitted he had desired women other than his wife, confessing he had \"looked on a lot of women with lust\" and \"committed adultery in my heart many times\". Other notable interviewees included jazz musician Miles Davis in 1962; writer Vladimir Nabokov in 1964; and John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1981. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Library of Congress in Washington produces a Braille version of Playboy, one of 30 general-interest magazines that are translated for the blind and visually-impaired. In 1985, Congress voted to stop producing a Braille Playboy over morality concerns and to save money. But a group of blind Playboy readers sued for their right to read the magazine and a judge ruled that the ban violated their First Amendment rights under the US constitution. The Braille version can be viewed here. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy has gained a reputation for riffing off business stories, beginning with a \"Women of Wall Street\" series in 1989 featuring nine stock market workers - shortly afterwards, seven of the nine were revealed to have left their jobs. Playboy continued with \"Women of Enron\" and \"Women of WorldCom\" shoots after those companies collapsed. It revisited the \"Women of Wall Street\" theme as the global financial crisis hit in 2008. The magazine advertised for models, requiring them to have worked for a financial institution and expressing a preference for those with senior management experience.\nPassage 3:\nSoon \"I read it for the articles\" will be more believable. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The iconic men's magazine Playboy says it is planning to drop fully nude female photography from its pages. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a letter to readers, the magazine predicted that everyone would be asking why, so it answered, \"Playboy has been a friend to nudity, and nudity has been a friend to Playboy, for decades. The short answer is: times change.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like so many other magazines, Playboy is reacting to the Internet revolution. In Playboy's case, it is about the ubiquity of online pornography. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. It's just passé at this juncture,\" Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders told The New York Times, which first reported the news on Monday night. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His comments sent shock waves through the magazine industry. Playboy, founded by Hugh Hefner, has been a controversial part of American popular culture since its debut in 1953. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Yes, we're taking a risk by going non-nude,\" the magazine said, \"but this is a company—like all great companies—that has risk in its DNA.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Playboy has a circulation of around 800,000 -- way down from its pre-Internet glory days when it boasted a circulation of many millions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Why is Playboy giving up nudity? NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By covering up the nude photos, the magazine hopes to appeal to a broader and younger audience both in print and online. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The change will take effect in February when Playboy publishes its March issue. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the magazine will continue to show women in what it calls provocative poses -- like Maxim, Esquire, GQ and other publications. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another competitor is Vice, an outlet that began as a print magazine and has evolved into a multimedia juggernaut valued at more than $2 billion. Both Playboy and Vice target young men living in urban areas. \"The difference between us and Vice,\" Flanders told the Times, \"is that we're going after the guy with a job.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Samir Husni, the director of Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi, said that the magazine's attempts at a younger audience may alienate the magazine's long-time subscriber base.

The family comedy — an adaptation of the popular app game — scored the third-best animated debut of the year, behind Zootopia ($75.1 million) and Kung Fu Panda 3 ($41.3 million). It was enough to knock Captain America: Civil War from its perch, which fell to No. 2. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Budgeted at $73 million, Angry Birds features the voices of Jason Sudeikis, Sean Penn, Maya Rudolph, Danny McBride and Josh Gad.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mark Udall, a champion of government transparency, urged the president today to publicly support the fullest declassification possible of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's exhaustive study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program. Udall, who serves on the committee, said anything less will not set the record straight on this dark chapter of the CIA's history. Udall also said without significant progress on his previous requests and on removing obstacles to committee oversight of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, he will be unable to support advancing Caroline Krass's nomination to be CIA general counsel.\nPassage 2:\n— The CIA Inspector Generals Office has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of malfeasance at the spy agency in connection with a yet-to-be released Senate Intelligence Committee report into the CIAs secret detention and interrogation program, McClatchy has learned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The criminal referral may be related to what several knowledgeable people said was CIA monitoring of computers used by Senate aides to prepare the study. The monitoring may have violated an agreement between the committee and the agency. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The development marks an unprecedented breakdown in relations between the CIA and its congressional overseers amid an extraordinary closed-door battle over the 6,300-page report on the agencys use of waterboarding and harsh interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists held in secret overseas prisons. The report is said to be a searing indictment of the program. The CIA has disputed some of the reports findings. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR White House officials have closely tracked the bitter struggle, a McClatchy investigation has found. But they havent directly intervened, perhaps because they are embroiled in their own feud with the committee, resisting surrendering top-secret documents that the CIA asserted were covered by executive privilege and sent to the White House. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR McClatchys findings are based on information found in official documents and provided by people with knowledge of the dispute being fought in the seventh-floor executive offices of the CIAs headquarters in Langley, Va., and the committees high-security work spaces on Capitol Hill. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The people who spoke to McClatchy asked not to be identified because the feud involves highly classified matters and carries enormous consequences for congressional oversight over the executive branch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The CIA and the committee declined to comment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, declined to discuss the matter and referred questions to the CIA and the Justice Department. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In question now is whether any part of the committees report, which took some four years to compose and cost $40 million, will ever see the light of day. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The report details how the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the use of interrogation techniques that many experts consider torture, according to public statements by committee members. It also shows, members have said, how the techniques didnt provide the intelligence that led the CIA to the hideout in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid by Navy SEALs. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The committee determined earlier this year that the CIA monitored computers  in possible violation of an agreement against doing so  that the agency had provided to intelligence committee staff in a secure room at CIA headquarters that the agency insisted they use to review millions of pages of top-secret reports, cables and other documents, according to people with knowledge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a panel member, apparently was referring to the monitoring when he asked CIA Director John Brennan at a Jan. 29 hearing if provisions of the Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act apply to the CIA? Seems to me thats a yes or no answer. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brennan replied that hed have to get back to Wyden after looking into what the act actually calls for and its applicability to CIAs authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law makes it a criminal act for someone to intentionally access a computer without authorization or to go beyond what theyre allowed to access. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR People familiar with the issue said it wasnt clear whether the monitoring violated any law or administrative regulations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., who has led calls for the CIA to allow the release of the report, also appeared to be referring to the monitoring in a letter he sent Tuesday to President Barack Obama. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee in relation to the internal CIA review and I find these actions to be incredibly troubling for the committees oversight responsibilities and for our democracy, Udall wrote. It is essential that the committee be able to do its oversight work  consistent with our constitutional principle of the separation of powers  without the CIA posing impediments or obstacles as it is today. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall also called on Obama to strip the CIA of control over how much of the Senate report should be made public. The report remains classified nearly 15 months after the panel approved the document and turned it over to the agency for vetting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is my belief that the declassification of the Committee Study is of paramount importance and that decisions about what should or should not be declassified regarding this issue should not be delegated to the CIA, but directly handled by the White House, Udall wrote. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Udall has led a handful of lawmakers in pressing for the release of the reports conclusions, which committee members have publicly said show that the CIA misled the Bush administration and Congress about the intelligence gained from using water-boarding and other interrogation techniques. On Tuesday, Hayden said For some time, the White House has made clear to the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that a summary of the findings and conclusions of the final report should be declassified, with any appropriate redactions necessary to protect national security. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The conflict over the committees investigation heightened late last year when the committee discovered that a CIA internal review confirming some of the committees findings had been withheld from Senate investigators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In his letter to Obama, Udall said the internal report not only corroborates aspects of the committees investigation, but acknowledges significant mistakes and errors made during the course of the CIA program. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It is vital that we understand how and why the content of the CIAs internal review contradicts the CIAs official June 27, 2013, response to the Committee, he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The agency has downplayed the importance of the document, characterizing it as a compilation of summaries of classified documents, rather than an analytical report. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story contained an incorrect date for the hearing at which Sen. Wyden asked CIA director Brennan whether federal computer fraud law applied to the CIA.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR LONDON (AP) _ Britain's royal family celebrated Christmas on Sunday with one notable absence _ Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip, who remains hospitalized following a heart procedure. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 90-year-old prince was recovering from having a coronary stent put in after doctors determined the heart pains that sent him to the hospital on Friday were caused by a blocked artery. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Buckingham Palace said \"he's in good spirits\" and family members will visit Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, in the hospital after lunch. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family's Christmas schedule kicked off with a traditional morning service at St. Mary Magdelene Church, on the queen's sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The huge crowds that gathered outside the church got an early peek when the royals made a quick private visit to the church ahead of the services. Less than two hours later, they were back _ in different clothes _ for the Christmas service. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Queen arrived first _ dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat _ in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate_ now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off the shelves in Britain, wore an eggplant-colored coat and matching hat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among the other royals present was the queen's granddaughter, Zara Philips, who was joined by her new husband Mike Tindall, an English rugby player. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After the service, children lined up to give bouquets of flowers to the queen. Thanking each well-wisher, the queen then handed the bouquets to her granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Well-wisher Camilla Fitt, 71, said Charles told her that his father, Philip, was \"very determined\" to get well. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Charles said he is coming on,\" said Fitt. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The royal family then traveled back to the house for lunch, an integral part of their celebration. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Another key part of their Christmas festivities is the queen's annual message to the nation, which this year will focus on family and community. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The 85-year-old queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957. She writes the speeches herself, and the broadcasts mark the rare occasion on which the queen voices her own opinion without government consultation.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\n'Alien: Covenant': Film Review NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Billy Crudup lead the ensemble of Ridley Scott's second installment in the 'Alien' prequel series. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There's life in the old bugger yet. And, as always, plenty of death. After the Alien series looked as though it had hit the rocks creatively (not for the first time) with the last entry, Prometheus, five years ago, savvy old master Ridley Scott has resuscitated it, and then some, with Alien: Covenant, the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gripping through its full two hours and spiked with some real surprises, this beautifully made sci-fi thriller will immeasurably boost fan interest in the run of prequels which Scott has recently said will consist of at least two more films until the action catches up to the 1979 original. This Fox release is a lock for major early summer box-office worldwide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Is there a director who has ever been artistically committed to a franchise as long as Scott has to the Alien series? None comes to mind (Steven Spielberg made his first Indiana Jones adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, in 1981, two years after Alien was released). It's a matter of record that Scott will turn 80 later this year, and Clint Eastwood will be 87 when he starts his new film; from the evidence on the screen, 80 may well be the new 50 where some top helmers are concerned, especially those who, like Scott and Eastwood, make a new film almost every year. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It also helped to recruit a couple of very good writers, John Logan and Dante Harper, to dig the series out of its hole. No matter that these aliens have been around far longer than most of the viewers who will see this film opening weekend have been alive; this entry feels vital, freshly thought out and keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The elegantly spare opening, in which a “synthetic,” Walter (Michael Fassbender), engages his “father” (an uncredited Guy Pearce) in a pointedly philosophical conversation, simply and effectively frames the thrust of the film's central interest in human life's origins and its prospects for survival. Casual viewers may assume that Walter is the same character Fassbender played in Prometheus. But, no, Walter, who sports an American, not British, accent, is an updated version of that all-purpose butler, factotum and technical wizard — a far friendlier iteration of the know-it-all computer Hal in 2001: A Space Odyssey. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And as in 2001, Alien: Covenant involves a long outer space voyage during which the 2,000 human passengers, along with 1,140 embryos, will linger in a deep-freeze sleep for several years while the humanoid plays watchdog. The giant ship, called Covenant, is headed for a very distant planet, Origae-6, which is considered a promising new home for humanity to settle. For this reason, not only the slumbering immigrants, but the crew, too, are composed of prospective parents meant to propagate and establish a new homeland for homo sapiens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This couples-only orientation lends a fresh feel to this group of space travelers, and definitely cranks up the emotional distress quotient as partners start splitting open and giving birth to the wrong kind of offspring. When a space storm hits and damages the ship's giant wind sails, the first to perish is the ship's captain (James Franco, seen ever-so-briefly), which devastates his mate Daniels (Katherine Waterston), assigned to oversee terraforming on humankind's new planet. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This accident promotes second-in-command Christopher (Billy Crudup) to run the show, but he's portrayed from the outset as uncertain and lacking in confidence; more than that, he's a “person of faith,” which puts him at great philosophical odds with most of the others. Unfortunately, once this element is introduced, the writers don't do much with it, so it feels like a missed opportunity to engage in some pithy religion vs. science debate. Worse, the character's overriding weakness as a man won't go over too well with faith-based audiences. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not only that, but when the crew discovers a nearby “hidden planet” that seems potentially compatible to human life, it's Christopher who makes the fateful decision to land there rather than to continue with their seven-year-long voyage. Farris (Amy Seimetz), the flier wife of the Covenant's main pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), goes down for a peek and it looks pretty darn good, just like New Zealand, in fact, where half the world wants to move to right now. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But as inviting as are the beautiful landscapes, mountains and lakes, there's trouble lurking in the magnificent flora and fauna and, given the particulars of this bloody franchise, it doesn't take long for humans to fall ill and start bursting with nasty and ferocious critters they never imagined could spring from their innards. This is not the sort of propagation the earthlings had in mind when they set off. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a brilliant stroke, the voyagers also encounter David, Walter's double, the very same “synthetic” who co-starred in Prometheus. Distinguishable from his supposedly new and improved relative by virtue of his long hair and British accent, this lone survivor of the previous voyage, who lives among the ruins of a great civilization wiped out by the aliens, gives Fassbender the delicious opportunity of a double performance. The actor makes the most of it, subtly delineating two nearly identical characters as they enact a contest for dominance, the details of which touch in clear but unpretentious ways on the notion of playing God. What goes down between the two remains uncertain right up to the fabulously diabolical twist ending. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scott and the writers have achieved an outstanding balance in Alien: Covenant among numerous different elements: Intelligent speculation and textbook sci-fi presumptions, startlingly inventive action and audience-pleasing old standbys, philosophical considerations and inescapable genre conventions, intense visual splendor and gore at its most grisly. The drama flows gorgeously and, unlike in many other franchises in which entries keep getting longer every time out, this one is served up without an ounce of fat. It provides all the tension and action the mainstream audience could want, along with a good deal more. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Stylistically, the film is a thing of cool beauty, with superb effects and a lovely score. Creatively, it's a major reset on a level with the series' best.

( Mark Rogers / Twentieth Century Fox ) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Starring Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, Danny McBride, Demian Bichir and Carmen Ejogo. Directed by Ridley Scott. Opens Friday in major theatres. 122 minutes. 18A The cast keeps expanding and the critters keep evolving, but there’s one constant to Ridley Scott’s Alien series. It’s the horrific fear of personal invasion, by something that’s about to leap up and latch onto you, causing unimaginable mayhem. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alien: Covenant has this dread in abundance. It ranks among the better chapters of a sci-fi horror franchise that began with the original Alien in 1979. Scott knows he dropped the ball with Prometheus, the erstwhile Alien prequel he foisted onto the unhappy masses in 2012. It barely showed the infamous beasties, choosing instead to batter senses with windy dialogue and events that seemed to betray basic elements of this decades-long saga. Alien: Covenant brings back the visceral panic that fans expect from the franchise, along with the show-stopping title creatures: among them the face-hugger, the chest-burster and the canoe-headed xenomorph of artist H.R. Giger’s terrifying imagination. They’re waiting to greet the unsuspecting crew of the spaceship Covenant, who have travelled to the far reaches of the galaxy in search of an Earthlike planet to colonize. (The most terrifying thing of all, barely acknowledged, is the thought of what must have happened to Earth if large-scale evacuations are underway.) The Covenant carries 2,000 passengers and 1,140 human embryos, all frozen in cryogenic deep sleep and with an emphasis on preserving couples and families as they make the years-long journey to a planet called Origae-6. Something happens that interrupts the journey and prompts the exploration of an unknown closer planet that looks to be every bit as inviting — until events prove that theory disastrously wrong. Scott and screenwriters John Logan (Spectre) and Dante Harper tidy up loose ends from Prometheus, making a much better story of the gods vs. men vs. machines ideas that director Scott has being exploring for decades, with Alien and also with Blade Runner. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In so doing, they revive a moribund franchise in much the same way The Force Awakens reignited the Star Wars saga, by reconjuring characters and themes from the past. It won’t take you long to figure out who the “Ripley” character is here, for example, and the perilous planet narrative dates right back to the original Alien, and indeed to the dawn of sci-fi moviemaking. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Article Continued Below NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This might make the film seem too derivative for some. But for those willing to embrace the retro elements — count me among them — it works like gangbusters. And a story like this can’t get by on terror alone. It also needs good actors to put it across, and Alien: Covenant more than delivers on that score. Michael Fassbender reprises his android character David from Prometheus, but this mechanical man acquires deeper intrigue when he’s matched against his factory double, an upgraded model named Walter, also played by Fassbender. This is a grand performance times two that demands to be remembered at awards time. Other standouts from the brilliant cast are Katherine Waterston as fearless scientist Daniels, Danny McBride as good ol’ boy pilot Tennessee and Billy Crudup as tragically promoted second-in-command Christopher, a weak man who assumes authority at exactly the wrong time. (Watch also for cameos from Guy Pearce and James Franco, as they help connect the dots between Prometheus and Alien: Covenant.) Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Jed Kurzel skilfully combine to boost the film’s fear of the unknown. They make the remote New Zealand shooting locale look and sound both like the verdant paradise the mystery planet is thought to be and the brutal hellhole it actually is. Franchise films very often disappoint, especially as later instalments run out of fresh ideas. Not so Alien: Covenant, which breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts. It leaves us seriously wondering what will happen next, but I can’t tell you more or you’ll yell — not only on Earth, but maybe also in space, where no one can hear you scream.\n", "answers": ["A spaceship arrives on a distant planet that looks like a perfect new home for humans in Alien: Covenant. But if you know anything about Alien movies, you'll know there's only terror in store. Here's what critics are saying about the latest installment of the franchise, with director Ridley Scott of 1979's Alien returning: The filmmakers have finally managed to \"dig the series out of its hole,\" Todd McCarthy puts it at the Hollywood Reporter. He calls Alien: Covenant \"the most satisfying entry in the six-films-and-counting franchise since the first two.\" Beautiful and gripping, it \"feels vital\" and is \"keen to keep us on our toes right up to the concluding scene, which leaves the audience with such a great reveal that it makes you want to see the next installment tomorrow.\" Peter Howell at the Toronto Star agrees this flick \"ranks among the better chapters\" of the franchise. Scott \"breaks new ground even while revisiting old concepts\" and \"brings back the visceral panic that fans expect.\" Actors Katherine Waterston, Danny McBride, Billy Crudup, and Michael Fassbender—who delivers \"a grand performance times two\" as two separate robots—also deserve high praise, he writes. The inclusion of Fassbender's David, from 2012's Prometheus, was an incredibly smart move, writes Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. But there was little else that impressed him. There's just \"nothing new\" to this \"gore fest,\" he writes. He acknowledges, however, that \"many Alien fans will come looking for something old, and that's in bloodily abundant supply.\" Chris Klimek had his own issues with the film. For example, \"a religious subtext is introduced and then immediately abandoned,\" he writes at NPR. But he, too, had to marvel at Fassbender, whose \"existential rap session\" provides the \"freshest part of the movie.\" Then again, Fassbender's David \"is the only character in whom Scott seems truly interested,\" he writes."], "length": 2356, "dataset": "multi_news_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "5c8c8d3158f3342ca74e9ce9da1508e49fe9a5abb156a80c"}
{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThroughout the race, Mr. Booker’s three rivals — all serious political forces in New Jersey — struggled to shift the focus on their own qualifications, prompting increasingly direct attacks on Mr. Booker’s record and business interests, including his ownership stake in an Internet start-up that had been created with financial backing of his powerful friends while he was in office. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s campaign pushed back hard against the attacks, saying there was nothing improper about his financial dealings and noting that he had given much of his income to charity and used his media appearances to focus attention on Newark. As he campaigned, he portrayed what his opponents saw as a weakness — that he was insufficiently liberal on issues important to Democrats like gun control and unions — as a strength. He argued that his pragmatic brand of politics, favoring practical solutions over ideology, had enabled him to lift the fortunes of Newark, the state’s largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR His message seemed to register with voters. Juan Valdes, a 38-year-old Palisades Park resident who voted for Mr. Booker, said that the mayor’s record in Newark far outweighed any criticism his rivals had. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “You can actually see the changes” in Newark, he said outside a polling place. “How he turned Newark, of all places, around to where it is, I figured he could do some good for the rest of us.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s political rise has been unconventional. After graduating from Yale Law School in 1997, he moved to Newark, where he lived in a housing project and became a community activist, making a successful bid for a City Council seat a year later. He positioned himself as an outsider, challenging the city’s political establishment. In 2002, he ran against Sharpe James, the powerful Newark mayor who had been dogged by scandal. Mr. Booker lost that race, but four years later won his second bid for the office and later a second term. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Booker’s public profile has always been much larger than would be expected for the mayor of a medium-size city. He is a regular on cable television shows, is in great demand on the speaking circuit and has long been mentioned as a possible presidential candidate. His ascension to the Senate would make him one of the most recognizable figures in a chamber known for its exclusivity.\nPassage 2:\nBy Matt Friedman and David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NEWARK — Newark Mayor Cory Booker has easily prevailed in the Democratic U.S. Senate primary tonight, the Associated Press projects. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker will now face Steve Lonegan, the Republican primary winner, in the Oct. 16 special election to succeed the late Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Results show Booker well ahead of his three rivals tonight: U.S. Reps. Rush Holt (D-6th Dist.) and Frank Pallone (D-12th Dist.), and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex). The difference is so large — with Booker leading his closest opponent, Pallone, by a two-to-one margin — that the Associated Press called the race with just 7 percent of the vote in. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With 98 percent of the vote in, Booker leads Pallone 59 percent to 20, followed by Holt with 17 and Oliver with 4. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"In Washington, so many people focus on right and left,\" Booker said in his victory speech tonight in front of hundreds of supporters gathered outside the Prudential Center in Newark. \"Here in Newark, we're only concerned with one direction — and that is moving forward. Make me your Senator, and I will be unwavering in my focus in finding common ground.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I believe that this state will once again light the way forward for all of America,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just after 8:40 p.m., when the primary was called for Booker, legendary hip-hop star Q-tip took the stage outside the arena. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The new Senator is wayyyyy ahead,\" Q Tip said in between a remix of The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR About 300 people were assembled on the plaza by 9 p.m. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker, 44, began the race as the frontrunner and never lost that status, raising far more money than his opponents and winning the backing of most of the state's Democratic organizations. His campaign also teamed up with South Jersey Democrats to get residents to cast their votes early by absentee ballot. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I will be just like that twenty-something who came to Newark to represent people who couldn't afford fancy lawyers,\" Booker, a former city councilman, told the audience tonight. \"I will care about you. I will care about results for all of the people in New Jersey.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker spent much of the race ignoring his three Democratic rivals, instead portraying himself as able to work across the aisle and get results, as demonstrated by relationship with Republican Gov. Chris Christie. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though Holt, Pallone and Oliver frequently went after Booker, their attacks gained little traction. His campaign hit its bumpiest patch in its final two weeks, when the New York Times raised questions about a tech company he founded, Waywire. It was not, however, enough to overcome his huge lead in the polls. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tonight, Booker praised his three primary opponents. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They are our champions, too,\" He said. \"We are no longer opponents. We are allies.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He also had kind words for his new opponent, Lonegan, a conservative activist, the former mayor of Bogota, and an aggressive campaigner who has been blasting Booker for weeks already. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"He is a person of strong beliefs and, I found already, even stronger rhetoric,\" Booker said. \"I will match his negative attacks with positive energy.

(Associated Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A rising star in the Democratic Party and a Republican former mayor won their parties' primaries on Tuesday to set up a campaign of political and stylistic contrasts as they seek to fill the final 15 months of the term of the late U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Newark Mayor Cory Booker defeated three experienced politicians _ U.S. Reps. Rush Holt and Frank Pallone, who had the support of Lautenberg's family, and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver _ in a Democratic primary that may have been more competitive had the field been less crowded. The race was a major draw for them partly because of New Jersey's history of electing only Democrats to the Senate over the past 40 years. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the Republican primary, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan won handily over Franklin Township physician Alieta Eck, who had never run for office before, even though she received support of some tea party organizations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The election is on a compressed schedule. The day after Lautenberg's death, Republican Gov. Chris Christie scheduled the primaries for Tuesday and a special election for Oct. 16, 20 days before the voting day on which he's seeking re-election. The move drew criticism, with some opponents saying Christie was spending $12 million on an extra election so he could avoid being on the same ballot as Booker, a claim Christie denies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker ran with the support of New Jersey's Democratic establishment and celebrities from across the country. Oprah Winfrey joined him at a fundraiser, and Eva Longoria campaigned with him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Booker is famous in the political world for his life story and his social media fanaticism: He has 1.4 million followers on Twitter, which he uses to field complaints about local issues such as sinkholes and to dispense inspirational quotes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He grew up in suburban Harrington Park, the son of some of the first black IBM executives, played football at Stanford, won a Rhodes scholarship, received a law degree from Yale, then moved into one of the toughest parts of Newark in an effort to revive the state's largest city. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He is in his second term as mayor. In the city, reviews are mixed, but his narrative has helped make him well-known elsewhere. And he's leveraged that power to help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in grant money for the city, including a $100 million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He's also given 90 paid speeches across the country since 2008, collecting $1.3 million, nearly half of which he has donated to charity. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan, who stepped down from his job as state director of the anti-tax group Americans for Prosperity, focused his primary campaign on blasting Booker. He held a news conference to ridicule Booker's broad anti-childhood poverty plan and another at the scene of a homicide in Newark to question whether Booker has done much to reduce crime. He's also been to the New York headquarters of Waywire, a technology startup Booker co-founded, to criticize his role in it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For Booker, the new opponent means needing to gird himself for attacks from the right after spending an abbreviated primary campaign being criticized from the left by opponents. In debates, Booker found himself defending working with Christie, explaining that he disagrees with the governor \"90 percent of the time\" and promoting his conciliatory image. He also reaffirmed his support for using taxpayer money to send children to private schools, one of the few policy prescriptions on which he and Lonegan agree. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lonegan is a familiar voice in New Jersey politics, blunt and conservative. He ran in and lost gubernatorial primaries in 2005 and 2009. He was a leader of successful opposition to ballot measures that would have raised a state sales tax and funded stem-cell research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Like Booker, he grew up in suburban Bergen County, in Ridgefield Park, and played college football, at William Paterson. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Both candidates also became better known through documentaries released in 2005. \"Anytown, U.S.A.\" looked at Lonegan's fiery re-election campaign in Bogota, and \"Street Fight\" chronicled Booker's first, and losing, run for mayor of Newark.\n", "answers": ["No contest: Cory Booker won the Democratic primary for a Senate seat in New Jersey so easily tonight that the AP called it just 45 minutes after the polls closed and with just 7% of returns in, reports the Star-Ledger.

On the Republican side, former Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan easily won his race as well. The special election is Oct. 16.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nA judge has resigned over his conduct of a rape trial in the face of a blistering recommendation for his removal from a national disciplinary body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Court Justice Robin Camp had asked a complainant in a 2014 rape trial why she did not keep her knees together, and mocked the law of consent. At a hearing conducted last fall by a disciplinary panel established by the Canadian Judicial Council, the 19-year-old homeless complainant said Justice Camp’s comment made her hate herself and feel like a slut. After the panel unanimously recommended his removal, Justice Camp went to great lengths to save his job. He publicly apologized to the complainant and his fellow judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice minister on resignation of 'knees together’ judge (The Canadian Press) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He called his knees-together comment “unforgivable,” and acknowledged that he had perceived the complainant’s fragility. He attended in-depth counselling and education sessions with several feminist scholars, three of whom testified at his disciplinary hearing last fall (attended daily by his wife and daughter) that he was sincerely interested in changing. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related: Before Justice Camp, these two judges were recommended for removal NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Unfounded: Police dismiss 1 in 5 sexual assault claims as baseless, Globe investigation reveals NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And he fought for an opportunity to appear in person before the larger body of judicial council members who considered the panel’s recommendation, to explain to them that he had acted out of “ignorance, not animus.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The council would receive only written submissions from him. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR By a vote of 19 to 4, the judicial council said in its ruling released on Thursday that the deep harm Justice Camp had done to public confidence made his dismissal necessary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “We find that the Judge’s conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the Judge incapable of executing the judicial office,” the council said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR All four dissenters, who found Judge Camp guilty of misconduct but opposed his dismissal, are male, and from the Atlantic provinces (one is Chief Justice of the Tax Court of Canada). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the president of the Canadian Association for Legal Ethics and a law professor at the University of Calgary, who, along with three other professors, filed the first complaint against Justice Camp, said she is pleased with the outcome. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I don’t think anything would have been served by carrying this on any further,” she said. “The denunciation was unequivocal. I think [resigning] was the admirable decision on his part and the right thing to do.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Constance Backhouse, chair in sexual assault legislation at the University of Ottawa’s law school, said rape myths are still pervasive in the justice system and society. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Our legal system still remains mired in 19th-century stereotypes about women, who are suspected of duplicity, promiscuity, malice, and false testimony,” she said. “And our legal thinking reflects the wider culture, which shares far too many of these notions. Until we get over the premise that it is women alone who are responsible for protecting themselves from rape, I suspect we will see more such trials and more protests demanding a woman’s right to sexual autonomy.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law of consent and the judiciary’s handling of sexual-assault trials continue to create controversy. In Nova Scotia, a judge acquitted a taxi driver last week of sexually assaulting a female passenger, saying “a drunk can consent.” That ruling is under appeal. The woman was so drunk she had urinated on herself and passed out in the back seat. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Recommendations that judges in effect be fired are rare in the Canadian system, which deems judicial independence a cornerstone. Justice Camp is only the third judge whose removal has been recommended since the judicial council was established in 1971. Both of the others also resigned rather than be removed under a provision of the Constitution that requires Parliament to approve dismissing a judge. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp’s comments came in the trial of Alexander Wagar in Calgary. The ruling came to light a year later, when the Alberta Court of Appeal overturned it, saying the judge had applied myths and stereotypes about sexual-assault victims. (By then, the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had promoted him from provincial court.) The judicial council received scores of complaints. Alberta Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley asked for the public disciplinary hearing. “On reviewing the transcripts, I felt it was important that victims know this was not an acceptable way to be treated by the justice system,” Ms. Ganley said in an e-mail to The Globe after Justice Camp resigned. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp, a father of three, received his law degree in 1975 from Stellenbosch University in South Africa, passed exams in Canada in 1998 and was admitted to the Alberta bar in 1999. In 2012, the Progressive Conservative government of Alison Redford appointed him to the Provincial Court. Before then, he practised business law in Calgary. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould brought a motion to the House of Commons in which she declared the government’s intent to support the recommendation for removal. Shortly afterward, Justice Camp issued a brief statement through his lawyer, Frank Addario of Toronto, expressing his “sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the Wagar trial.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from Patrick White NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Report Typo/Error\nPassage 2:\nA judge who asked a sexual assault complainant why she couldn't keep her “knees together” confirmed he will resign after the Canadian Judicial Council recommended his removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Robin Camp issued a statement Thursday in which he said he will resign from the Federal Court of Canada effective Friday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments,” Camp’s statement went on. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Canadian Judicial Council’s report called Camp’s conduct “so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that the judge was rendered incapable of executing the judicial office.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Camp’s lawyer Frank Addario had argued that removal was not necessary to preserve public confidence in this case. Four of the council's 23 members did not support removal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was in the process of moving forward on the council’s recommendation in Parliament Thursday when she learned of Camp’s resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould later told reporters that the extremely rare removal would have been needed “to ensure the integrity and public confidence in the justice system and the judiciary.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Sexual assault and gender-based violence is in no form acceptable and we will continue to stand up for victims of sexual assault and gender-based violence,” Wilson-Raybould added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Norman Sabourin, Executive Director and Senior General Council at the Canadian Judicial Council, told CTV News Channel removals are recommended when the “public has lost confidence in a judge’s ability to discharge the duties of office.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “The report of the council emphasizes that all judges have to know the law but also have to possess empathy, have to understand that people who come before them are often vulnerable people and they have to treat them with a degree of civility and deference,” Sabourin said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp, who was appointed to the federal court in 2015, faced judicial review after it was revealed that he had stated in a 2014 Alberta provincial court decision that \"pain and sex sometimes go together” and asked the complainant why she didn’t just “keep her knees together.” He also said, \"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if they're drunk.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alexander Wagar was acquitted by Camp. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alberta’s Appeal Court ordered a new trial and last month Wagar was again acquitted. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complainant, who was 19 at the time of the first trial, told the disciplinary hearing last year that Camp's comments had made her hate herself. She said she had contemplated suicide as a result of her experience. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After Thursday’s decision, the complainant said \"I was feeling so unhopeful and pretty down and not very hopeful about the justice system but it has kind of turned around by this.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR ‘Watershed moment’ NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alice Woolley, the University of Calgary law professor who complained about Camp’s conduct, said she was pleased with the decision. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Actors within the legal system can make really terrible decisions and terrible mistakes and in his case engage in real misconduct,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “But the legal system orients towards progress,” she added. “It tries to get it right in the end.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Kathleen Mahoney, who is also a law professor at the University of Calgary, told CTV News Channel that she believes the removal is a “watershed moment” in how courts treat sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I think this is a very strong statement from the judges of Canada that the time has come that gender bias in these kinds of decisions will no longer be tolerated,” she said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahoney added that she believes the case highlights the need for mandatory judicial training focusing on gendered issues such sexual assault, domestic violence and sexual harassment. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Conservatives have introduced legislation that would require better training for judges in handling sexual assault cases. The justice minister agreed Thursday that judges need to be properly trained. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp’s decision is not the only recent case to raise questions about how judges handle sexual assault. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Halifax earlier this month, Justice Gregory Lenehan acquitted a taxi driver accused of sexually assaulting a passenger so intoxicated that she passed out. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lenehan said in his ruling that “clearly, a drunk can consent.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With a report from CTV’s Glen McGregor and files from The Canadian Press\nPassage 3:\nFederal Court Justice Robin Camp, dubbed the \"knees together judge\" for his comments in a sex assault case, has submitted his resignation following a recommendation from Canada's judicial watchdog that he be removed from the bench. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a ruling announced Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) said that at a 2014 sexual assault trial he was presiding over, Camp \"showed obvious disdain for some of the characteristics of the regime enacted by Parliament in respect of sexual assault issues.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We find that the judge's conduct, viewed in its totality and in light of all of its consequences, was so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role that public confidence is sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office,\" the council's ruling reads. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement from his lawyer, Camp announced his intention to resign and apologized. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I have advised Chief Justice Crampton that effective March 10, 2017, I will resign as a member of the Federal Court of Canada,\" the statement read. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"I would like to express my sincere apology to everyone who was hurt by my comments during the [sex assault] trial. I thank everyone who was generous and kind to me and my family in the last 15 months, particularly my legal team.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Before Camp's statement was issued, Justice Minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould rose in the House of Commons seeking unanimous consent for a motion to remove Camp from the bench, but that consent was denied. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Conservative Saskatchewan MP Tom Lukiwksi then rose on a point of order and complained the minister had not ensured she had the unanimous consent of all parties before moving her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Votes in both the House of Commons and the Senate are required to remove a federal judge, a move presumably no longer required with Camp's resignation. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wilson-Raybould told reporters on Parliament Hill she learned of Camp's decision after she sought support for her motion. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The unexpected move by the federal Justice Minister was stopped by an opposition MP 1:05 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Court transcripts from the 2014 sexual assault trial show Camp, who was then a provincial court judge, called the complainant, who was homeless and 19 years old at the time of the alleged assault, \"the accused\" numerous times — a mistake he repeated at the judicial council hearing before correcting himself. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp also told the young woman \"pain and sex sometimes go together\" and asked why she didn't just keep her \"knees together.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 'Antithetical' to contemporary values NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The judge apologized several times for those comments, underwent counselling and took additional training on Canada's sexual assault laws. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But that wasn't enough for the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"The statements made by Justice Camp during the trial and in his decision, the values implicit in those statements and the way in which he conducted himself are so antithetical to the contemporary values of our judicial system with respect to the manner in which complainants in sexual assault cases should be treated that, in our view, confidence in the system cannot be maintained unless the system disassociates itself from the image which the judge, by his statements and approach, represents in the mind of a reasonable member of the public,\" wrote the majority. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Parliament considers training for judges NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR NDP MP Murray Rankin said that by resigning, Camp took the only course of action available in light of the conclusions of the judicial council. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rankin added that Camp's case bolsters a private member's bill by interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to ensure judges know Canada's sexual assault laws. Parliament voted unanimously this week to send that bill to committee for further study. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ambrose, in a statement welcoming the council's ruling, said her bill was designed to hold the judiciary responsible for the ongoing training of its judges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Unfortunately, there is not enough accountability on the part of the judiciary in ensuring that judges have the updated training Canadians expect them to have. This needs to change,\" Ambrose said in the statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Until Thursday, Camp had fought hard to keep his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He asked to speak directly to the 23 chief and associate chief justices who make up the CJC. But the majority said Camp had already \"been fully and fairly heard,\" and declined saying nothing had changed since his public hearing last fall. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Camp then asked the Federal Court to stop the judicial council from deliberating his fate and to review an earlier decision he be dismissed. His lawyer Frank Addario argued the judicial council should consider the fact that Alexander Scott Wager, the man who was accused of sexual assault in the original trial, had once again been acquitted. The judge refused to stall the CJC. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Since the council's creation in 1971, no judge has gone to such lengths to keep his job. There have only been two other cases where the council recommended Parliament remove a judge from the bench and in both cases the men resigned almost immediately. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Just like any other judge facing discipline, Camp's legal battle has been paid for by taxpayers through the Commission for Federal Judicial Affairs, which has refused to say how much it has cost so far. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Four judges dissented from the majority and said Camp should not lose his job because he has rehabilitated himself through counselling and further education.\n", "answers": ["A judge who asked a 19-year-old woman why she couldn't have just kept her legs together to prevent being raped has quit rather than be forced out.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nAntarctic notothenioid fishes are protected from freezing by antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that bind to invading ice crystals and inhibit their growth. Paradoxically, accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could be lethal. Whether and how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown; one hypothesis is that it melts during summer warming episodes. However, prior in vitro evidence indicates that AFPs also inhibit melting. Our study establishes that pronounced melting inhibition occurs in vivo (i.e., superheated ice occurs inside notothenioid fishes). Our long-term temperature record of a high-latitude Antarctic fish habitat indicates that summer warming does not overcome AFP-induced superheating to reliably rid fishes of ice. Evolution of the life-saving AFPs exacts a cost: the risk of lifelong accumulation of damaging internal ice crystals. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abstract NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) of polar marine teleost fishes are widely recognized as an evolutionary innovation of vast adaptive value in that, by adsorbing to and inhibiting the growth of internalized environmental ice crystals, they prevent death by inoculative freezing. Paradoxically, systemic accumulation of AFP-stabilized ice could also be lethal. Whether or how fishes eliminate internal ice is unknown. To investigate if ice inside high-latitude Antarctic notothenioid fishes could melt seasonally, we measured its melting point and obtained a decadal temperature record from a shallow benthic fish habitat in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We found that AFP-stabilized ice resists melting at temperatures above the expected equilibrium freezing/melting point (eqFMP), both in vitro and in vivo. Superheated ice was directly observed in notothenioid serum samples and in solutions of purified AFPs, and ice was found to persist inside live fishes at temperatures more than 1 °C above their eqFMP for at least 24 h, and at a lower temperature for at least several days. Field experiments confirmed that superheated ice occurs naturally inside wild fishes. Over the long-term record (1999–2012), seawater temperature surpassed the fish eqFMP in most summers, but never exceeded the highest temperature at which ice persisted inside experimental fishes. Thus, because of the effects of AFP-induced melting inhibition, summer warming may not reliably eliminate internal ice. Our results expose a potentially antagonistic pleiotropic effect of AFPs: beneficial freezing avoidance is accompanied by melting inhibition that may contribute to lifelong accumulation of detrimental internal ice crystals.\nPassage 2:\nEUGENE, Ore., Sept. 23 (UPI) -- Fish species that make their home in the frigid waters of Antarctica have developed special antifreeze proteins that keep their blood from icing over. But evolution is a strange game in which seemingly every adaptive trait comes with a trade-off, and for the fish of Antarctica that trade-off is quite the paradox. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For the benefit of avoiding frozen blood, Antarctic notothenioid fish species must tolerate ice in their veins. That's right, the same antifreeze proteins that latch onto ice crystals and prevent them from growing also inhibit them from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A team of marine biologists discovered the odd trade-off while studying the coping mechanisms of notothenioid species living in supremely cold conditions. They discovered the antifreeze proteins' anti-melting properties after raising water temperatures slightly above the freezing point and still finding some ice in the blood of the fish specimens. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We discovered what appears to be an undesirable consequence of the evolution of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic notothenioid fishes,\" study author Paul Cziko, a doctoral student the University of Oregon's Institute of Ecology and Evolution, said in a press release. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR If water temperature rises more than two or three degrees above the freezing point, these ice crystals are likely to melt. But Cziko and his colleagues at the University of Illinois found that ocean temperatures in the Antarctic rarely ever rose high enough to help clean the species icy veins. That means these fish carry ice crystals around with them for most of their lives -- a risky proposition that could help them stay cool under pressure but could also cause a life-threatening traffic jam inside small capillaries. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Since much of the ice accumulates in the fishes' spleens, we think there may be a mechanism to clear the ice from the circulation,\" Cziko added. \"This is just one more piece in the puzzle of how notothenioids came to dominate the ocean around Antarctica.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\nPassage 3:\nScientists long have known that antifreeze proteins help a species of Antarctic fish survive in frigid waters. Now research has found that these proteins also prevent some fish from ever ridding themselves of the ice in their bodies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The notothenioid fish uses evolutionary mechanisms to survive in anchor ice that exists on the sea floors of the Antarctic region. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Even after being studied for decades, the notothenioid, a bony fish that thrives in frigid waters, continues to hold surprises. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Notothenioids own the waters circling Antarctica known as the Southern Ocean; one of the few species that can survive in seawater temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit, it makes up more than 90 percent of the fish biomass in the region. It's no wonder, then, that scientists began to investigate how these animals thrive in this icy environment without freezing over. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Scientists have been revealing startling facts about the notothenioid for more than four decades now, including the discovery, in the 1960s, of antifreeze proteins inside these fishes, a vital tool for their survival. But according to a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers have revealed that these proteins may not be as helpful as they were once thought to be. The proteins do indeed help prevent water from freezing in the fish, but it turns out they also prevent ice from melting. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We've known for a long time that the antifreeze proteins are at the essence of how these fishes survive in their freezing environment. But we're still working out the details, and this is one of those details,\" Paul Cziko, lead author of the paper, told the Monitor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mr. Cziko, a doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon, worked with Christina Cheng and Arthur DeVries, a husband-and-wife team of animal biologists at the University of Illinois. Devries revealed in the late 1960s that antifreeze proteins existed in the bodies of notothenioids. In the 1990s, he discovered that the fishes were also carrying ice crystals in various organs, such as the gills and the spleen. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In this new study, Cziko's team tested fish in the lab by warming them to a point at which the ice in their bodies completely melted. These were temperatures, though, that the notothenioid never experiences in its own environment. They also examined temperature data logged continuously over the last 11 years in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research group found that the ice crystals didn't melt at their expected melting point of about 30 degrees Fahrenheit, but instead remained intact. The fish continued to contain ice even after researchers raised the temperature further another 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was primarily due to the antifreeze protein. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Though the life-saving protein was given the name \"antifreeze,\" it works differently from, say, the liquid you mix with your windshield wiper fluid, according to Cziko. Rather than acting like a salt and lowering the freezing point, the notothenioids' antifreeze proteins bind themselves to the ice crystals in their bodies and alter the surface of the crystals so that they have a hard time growing any larger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR This mechanism doesn't just make it very hard for the ice crystals to grow, though. The proteins bind themselves so tightly that they also make it difficult for the ice to get any smaller, even in above-freezing temperatures. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"When people are studying antifreeze proteins they're looking at the ability of the organisms to deal with cold temperatures and not warm temperatures,\" says Cziko. \"All their focus is towards 'How much does it protect against freezing?' and people just kind of missed that there could also be an anti-melting effect that's important.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In controlled settings, scientists have been able to heat ice above its melting point without having the ice melt. But Cziko says this may be the first example of \"superheating\" found in nature. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR So what does this superheated ice mean for the fish? Even in the slightly warmer summer months when the notothenioid has a chance to thaw out, some ice crystals linger. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Whether or not there are any adverse effects on the fishes' bodies is still unknown. The long-term cost of having the protein, Cziko says, is a question for further research. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"If they can tolerate it, maybe they've evolved some other mechanism to deal with these ice crystals inside their bodies,\" says Cziko. \"And maybe in the long-term it does kill the fish and they're not that good at dealing with it.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The highest concentration of ice crystals resided in the fishes' spleens. Cziko says it's possible that the spleen is trying to filter these ice crystals out of the blood to prevent their causing problems in other parts of the body. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cziko also says research on this particular evolutionary puzzle provides us with a better understanding of the progression of all species. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"This shows that with every good evolutionary innovation, some potentially bad or unintended consequences come along with that,\" says Cziko \"Evolution is a stepwise process. You take two steps forward, and take one step back.\"\n", "answers": ["How do the fish that thrive in the waters around Antarctica prevent their blood from turning to ice? Turns out at least some of them don't. Scientists have long known that the group of fish species known as notothenioids have an antifreeze protein in their blood that prevents them from being frozen to death, but new research has revealed that the same protein keeps ice crystals in their veins, apparently permanently, UPI reports. The crystals melted at a few degrees above freezing, but the fish may spend their whole lives without encountering temperatures that warm, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler worked as a loan officer and a financial consultant before taking a job as a nurse at Magee-Womens Hospital in 2014, according to his LinkedIn.com profile. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “As an adult, deflecting my religion by saying ‘I’m not that religious,’ makes it easier for people to accept I’m Jewish — especially when I tell them my father is a rabbi. ‘I’m not that religious,’ is like saying, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not that Jewish, therefore, I’m not so different than you,’ and like clockwork, people don’t look at me as awkwardly as they did a few seconds beforehand,” he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler said he did his best to treat Bowers with “compassion and empathy. … I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.

I mean, he’s coming off the ambulance yelling ‘kill all the Jews’ and those are the people treating him. That is the height of stupidity.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the lead people who immediately treated Bowers at Allegheny General were Jewish, Cohen said. They include the attending emergency room doctor and a registered nurse whose own father is a rabbi, he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen declined to name them but praised them for honoring their profession by putting their emotions aside. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “It’s hard.

They didn’t ask anything about him. He was a patient.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Not long after treating Bowers, the young nurse broke down in tears. Cohen met with him for about 20 minutes and thanked him for doing his job. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “He was pretty broken,” Cohen said. “I told him how proud I was. He went home and hugged his parents.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cohen, 63, lives about 50 yards from the Tree of Life Congregation where the mass shooting occurred. He was home on Saturday morning when he heard a loud noise outside. Within minutes, his daughter yelled to him to come downstairs and they watched as police and SWAT teams descended on their street. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He described the congregation as a safe place where people gather daily to pray and socialize.

Bowers had been wounded during a shoot-out with police. Two of the men who treated him at Allegheny General were themselves Jewish. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The president of the hospital, Dr. Jeff Cohen, was a member of the Tree of Life synagogue.

He said he didn’t want to go into detail about his interactions with Bowers, but he did say that the suspect thanked him for his kindness and for saving his life. Mahler wrote that he treated Bowers just the same way as he treats all of his patients. But he also wrote that, as Bowers was being wheeled into the emergency room, he yelled, “Death to all Jews!” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jeff Cohen, the president of Allegheny General Hospital, said that after Bowers’ treatment Mahler came to him in tears, overwhelmed by what had just taken place.

Mahler’s Father Is a Retired Rabbi NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler’s father is Rabbi Mark Joel Mahler, who served as the rabbi of Temple Emanuel, a reform synagogue in South Hills, from 1980 until 2018. Rabbi Mahler retired in June of 2018. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The rabbi was known for his use of music; he played guitar and sang during Sabbath services, and he led the synagogue’s band. Several of his children (not Ari) also participated in the band. Rabbi Mahler was also a member of the South Hills Interfaith Ministries and the National Conference of Christian and Jews. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rabbi Mahler and his wife Alice have four children: Ari, Shoshana, Moshe, and Shira. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 3. Mahler Says He Often Experienced Anti-Semitism Growing Up NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler wrote that he was not shocked by the Pittsburgh shooting; the Pittsburgh native says that anti-Semitism is nothing new for him. As a boy, he says, he often experienced bullying because he was Jewish. He described finding swastikas scrawled on his locker at school, or finding pictures of his family being sent to the gas chamber. And, Mahler writes, he never managed to confront the bullying head-on: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “I experienced anti-Semitism a lot as a kid. It’s hard for me to say if it was always a product of genuine hatred, or if kids with their own problems found a reason to single me out from others. Sure, there were a few Jewish kids at my school, but no one else had a father who was a Rabbi. I found drawings on desks of my family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on my locker, and notes shoved inside of it saying, “Die Jew. Love, Hitler.” It was a different time back then, where bullying was not monitored like it is now. I was weak, too. Rather than tell anyone, I hid behind fear. Telling on the people who did this would only lead to consequences far worse.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler also says that he developed defense mechanisms to shield himself from anti-Semites. He got into the habit of telling people that he isn’t very religious. Mahler wrote that even people who view Judaism positively often seem to feel uncomfortable when they meet Jewish people. And so, he says, he’s learned over the years how to ease awkward moments by deflecting attention from his Jewishness. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR 4. Mahler Worked as a Financial Consultant Before Going to Work as a Nurse NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Ari Mahler was an honors student at the University of Maryland, graduating in 1999 with a BA in English.

He wrote, “I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Mahler wrapped up his Facebook post with a plea. He wrote, NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. The meaning of life is to give meaning to life, and love is the ultimate force that connects all living beings.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a Mediterranean city of Alexandria courtroom, the 21 young female defendants flashed defiant smiles to the media, standing handcuffed in white head scarves and white prison uniforms in the defendants cage. They were convicted on charges related to holding an Oct. 31 protest in the city demanding Morsi's reinstatement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Among them were seven teenagers aged 15 and 16, who were sentenced to prison terms until they turn 18. The rest _ most aged 18 to 22 _ were sentenced to 11 years in prison. Six other Brotherhood members were sentenced to 15 years in prison for inciting the demonstrations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We thought they will get a month or something but we were shocked with the 11 years,\" defense lawyer al-Shimaa Ibrahim Saad said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, said the sentences are meant to be a \"deterrent\" for the group's opposition to the military, vowing the verdict \"will only increase the determination of the people to get their rights.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Meanwhile, hundreds of secular youth activists protested Wednesday in downtown Cairo against the government's clampdown on dissent. At the center of the crisis is the law issued this week banning any protests or public political gatherings of more than 10 people without a prior police permit, imposing stiff fines and jail terms for violators. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Those thinking the authoritarian pharaonic style works will find it doesn't anymore,\" said one protester, Laila Soueif. \"There will be a third wave of the revolution much more violent than before. We are witnessing a turning point.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A day earlier, security forces broke up two small activists' protests in Cairo. Security forces beat and dragged women protesters outside parliament. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The images were reminiscent of the days of Mubarak, the autocrat who ruled the country for nearly 30 years and was ousted in a 2011 uprising. Under his rule, police at times focused on humiliating female protesters. Similarly, under the rule of the military that followed his ouster, police broke up an anti-military protest, half-stripping a female protester and stomping on her chest. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After breaking up Tuesday's protest, police detained 14 women, then drove them in a van through the desert where they were dropped off on a remote road in the middle of the night, several of the women said. That too is a tactic used by Mubarak-era police to intimidate protesters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"They want to terrorize us,\" said Mona Seif, a prominent activist who was among the 14 women. \"I think the interior minister decided to escalate and tell everyone whose family was killed... beaten or anything that I am here, this is how I do business, and if you don't like it, beat your head against the wall.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In the face of the criticism, the Cabinet issued a strongly worded statement saying it is determined to implement the new protest law with \"all firmness and force ... so freedom doesn't turn to chaos.\" It linked it to a \"war on terrorism\" _ pointing to the Brotherhood protests and violence by Islamic militants in Sinai. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"There are elements that want to spread domestic chaos in a desperate attempt to hurt the prestige of the state,\" it said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law comes ahead of an election season that will include a referendum on amendments to the Islamist-drafted, Morsi-era constitution. Authorities have shown they are eager to push through the new charter _ but they could face troubles in the January vote on two fronts. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Secular activists oppose the document because of wider powers it gives the military and the president. The Brotherhood rejects the entire amendment process _ along with the new government in general _ and although it has been weakened by a crackdown, it has kept up protests for over 20 weeks and can still mobilize against the document. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, the prosecutor general's office ordered 24 people who were arrested in Tuesday's activist protest to be held for four days for questioning on possible charges of violating the protest law. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a statement, the prosecutors office accused the protesters of \"chanting antagonistic slogans against the state\" and refusing to end their rally. It said the demonstration \"disturbed traffic and affected citizens' interests,\" terms mentioned in the protest law as violations justifying police action. It also accused them of attacking a police officer and taking his telephone. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The prosecutor also ordered the arrests of Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Ahmed Maher, two top activists, on suspicion of inciting others to break the protest law, the state news agency MENA said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In a sign of the Islamists' eagerness to find a common cause with secular activists, the Brotherhood-led coalition supporting Morsi reached out to them Wednesday with a statement denouncing \"brutal repression\" of the protests the day before, saying the \"youth of the revolution stand united.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood-led coalition, Diaa al-Sawi, said he will contact youth activists to coordinate rallies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They met a quick rejection, however, from the youth activists, who joined the massive anti-Morsi protests that preceded his ouster. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"A message to the Muslim Brotherhood: we will not put our hands in the hands of those who betrayed and hijacked the revolution,\" said Hossam Moanis, spokesman of one activist group, the Popular Current.\nPassage 2:\nCairo (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested the head of the defense team for the 21 women and girls sentenced for protesting in Egypt last month, a colleague and member of the defense team told CNN. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Lawyer Ahmed El-Hamrawy was arrested at his home in Alexandria at dawn Monday, lawyer Mahmoud Farouq told CNN. \"I can't separate his arrest from the girls' case,\" said Farouq, who is part of the team defending the 21 jailed protesters. \"This means that any lawyer who comes close to the case will be detained.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gen. Nasser El-Abd, the head of the Alexandria Criminal Investigation Department, told Egyptian daily newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that El-Hamrawy was arrested with five others for \"incitement of violence.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Reports: Egypt's draft constitution goes to interim president NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Wednesday, 14 women were sentenced to 11 years in prison, and seven minors to juvenile detention, on charges of gathering, thuggery and weapons possession at a demonstration for ousted President Mohamed Morsy. The harsh sentence sparked wide criticism of the way the Interior Ministry and the judiciary have been handling the cases of Morsy supporters. An appeals hearing for their case is scheduled to take place Saturday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"We don't have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years for various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,\" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups last week. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Egyptian lawmakers begin vote on new constitution NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The verdict coincided with an increasing crackdown on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah, detained during the Mubarak and the military council regimes in 2006 and 2011, is being held pending investigations for his alleged involvement in calling for a demonstration. Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, is also being questioned about similar charges. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Legislation restricting demonstrations reignited confrontations between police and the non-Islamist opposition, especially at university campuses across the country. A demonstration coinciding with the retrial of two policemen accused of killing Khaled Saied, whose death had fueled the uprising in 2011, was dispersed with force in Alexandria on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"El-Hamrawy was part of Morsy's opposition. He demonstrated against him on June 30, but he's been involved in defending freedoms since July 3,\" when the military removed the Islamist President from power, Farouq told CNN. \"He's being punished for that.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Read: Prison sentences for women as Egypt clamps down on protest\n", "answers": ["As protests rage on in Egypt, the lawyer at the helm of the defense team representing 21 young female protesters was today arrested at home for \"incitement of violence,\" CNN reports.

{"input": "", "context": "Passage 1:\nThe upcoming Tribeca Film Festival has come under heat for its screening of a documentary that promotes the anti-vaccination movement. In a statement, Robert De Niro defended the screening of Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe while also distancing himself as part of the anti-vaccination movement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Related Anti-Vaxxers: The Privilege of Putting Everyone at Risk If you're doing well enough, your bad decisions will probably only hurt someone else NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace [Hightower, De Niro's wife] and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined,\" De Niro said (via Variety). \"In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However, this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening Vaxxed. I am not personally endorsing the film, nor am I anti-vaccination; I am only providing the opportunity for a conversation around the issue.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Andrew Wakefield, the doctor-turned-documentarian behind Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe, argues that vaccinations given to infants could lead to autism, a claim that the Centers for Disease Control has long denied. Wakefield's research papers on the subject have been attacked and discredited, and while his bio page on the Tribeca site mentions his work in the field, it doesn't mention that he's been accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information. Wakefield was also stripped of his medical license. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR De Niro's statement has sparked even more controversy as the actor's decision to include the documentary as part of the film festival that he helped found represents only one side of the anti-vaccination debate. Filmmaker Penny Lane, who made the documentary Nuts! about a snake oil salesman and medical fraud in general, penned an open letter to the Tribeca Film Festival asking them to reconsider the Vaxxed screening. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"While it is true that we documentary filmmakers constantly debate vexing questions about the perceived and real differences between our work and the work of traditional journalism, I assure you that we are not debating whether it is okay to knowingly spread dangerous lies,\" Lane wrote of Wakefield. \"In other words: issues around truth and ethics in documentary can get thorny. But this one should have been easy. The anti-vaccination hoax has been completely discredited by now. This film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the 'vaccines cause autism' hoax; this film is 'directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax.'\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As of now, Vaxxed is scheduled to screen April 24th at the film festival.\nPassage 2:\nMr. De Niro’s statement seemed to suggest that this was the first time he has expressed a preference that a particular film be shown at the festival. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace and I have a child with autism,” he wrote, referring to his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, “and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined.

However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Within hours his statement, posted on Facebook, generated hundreds of comments. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The trailer for the film, filled with dramatic music, opens with the words “Are Our Children Safe?” on a black screen with billowing smoke that appears to be coming from a syringe. The trailer includes the suggestion that a “whistle-blower” from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would say that the organization “had committed fraud” and “that they knew that vaccines were actually causing autism.” Mr. Wakefield appears in the trailer saying, “Wow, the C.D.C. had known all along there was this M.M.R. autism risk.”\nPassage 3:\nThe Tribeca Film Festival is facing serious backlash for including anti-vaccination documentary “Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe” from doctor-turned-documentarian Andrew Wakefield into its 2016 lineup. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Wakefield is a fervent believer in the link between vaccination and autism. He has also been the subject of many controversies, including being accused of professional misconduct and falsifying information as early as 1998 in one of his research papers. Wakefield’s bio on the festival’s page for the documentary mentions the research paper and study but not that it was later discredited. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Many called for a response about the festival’s decision. Robert DeNiro, co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, defended the choice to include the film, even though he doesn’t endorse the content. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Grace and I have a child with autism and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Including the film has prompted some to categorized the festival’s decision as “irresponsible” and called out the film for being “dishonest” and “one-sided” in its message. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the Centers for Disease Control, there is no link between vaccination and Autism Spectrum Disorders. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, in a statement on the org’s website says “vaccines are very important” and “parents must make the decision whether to vaccinate their children.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He adds that, “If parents decide not to vaccinate they must be aware of the consequences in their community and their local schools.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The film premieres on April 24 at the Tribeca Film Festival, which will include a conversation with the filmmakers after the screening.\nPassage 4:\nVaxxed NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Tribeca Film Festival, I love you but you made a very serious mistake. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On Monday, the widely discredited and dangerous anti-vaccination quack Andrew Wakefield tweeted: “Haven’t posted forever. Huge news tomorrow.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps he hadn’t “posted forever” because the media finally stopped giving him a megaphone.
