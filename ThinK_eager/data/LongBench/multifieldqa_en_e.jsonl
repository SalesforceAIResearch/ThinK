{"input": "What was Hugh H. Goodwin's rank in the United States Navy?", "context": "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.\n\nFollowing the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.\n\nAlthough he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.\n\nGoodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.\n\nHe then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.\n\nGoodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.\n\nIn June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.\n\nHe was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.\n\nGoodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .\n\nWhen his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.\n\nBy the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.\n\nDuring the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.\n\nThe air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.\n\nGoodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nHe was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.\n\nGoodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat \"V\". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nPostwar service\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.\n\nGoodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.\n\nRevolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.\n\nGoodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.\n\nLater service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nWhile in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.\n\nGoodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.\n\nOn December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.\n\nRetirement\n\nGoodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nVice admiral Hugh H.

In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.\n\nIn early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.\n\nHistory\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.\n\nYerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.\nExperience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth. Along with two Ukrainian players, Ugandan international, Noah Kasule, has been signed.\n\nThe club headquarters are located on Jivani Street 2 of the Malatia-Sebastia District, Yerevan.\n\nDomestic\n\nEuropean\n\nStadium\n\nThe construction of the Banants Stadium was launched in 2006 in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, with the assistance of the FIFA goal programme. It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).\n\nTraining centre/academy\nBanants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.\n\nFans\nThe most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.\n\nAchievements\n Armenian Premier League\n Winner (1): 2013–14.\n Runner-up (5): 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2018.\n\n Armenian Cup\n Winner (3): 1992, 2007, 2016.\n Runner-up (6): 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2021–22\n\n Armenian Supercup\n Winner (1): 2014.\n Runner-up (5): 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2016.\n\nCurrent squad\n\nOut on loan\n\nPersonnel\n\nTechnical staff\n\nManagement\n\nUrartu-2\n\nFC Banants' reserve squad play as FC Banants-2 in the Armenian First League.

{"input": "What is the correct expression for the derivative of the function?", "context": "\\section{Introduction}\n\nDerivate is one of the most important topics not only in mathematics, but also in physics, chemistry, economics and engineering. Every standard Calculus course provides a variety of exercises for the students to learn how to apply the concept of derivative. The types of problems range from finding an equation of the tangent line to the application of differentials and advanced curve sketching. Usually, these exercises heavily rely on such differentiation techniques as Product, Quotient and Chain Rules, Implicit and Logarithmic Differentiation \\cite{Stewart2012}. The definition of the derivative is hardly ever applied after the first few classes and its use is not much motivated.\n\nLike many other topics in undergraduate mathematics, derivative gave rise to many misconceptions \\cite{Muzangwa2012}, \\cite{Gur2007}, \\cite{Li2006}. Just when the students seem to learn how to use the differentiation rules for most essential functions, the application of the derivative brings new issues. A common students' error of determining the domain of the derivative from its formula is discussed in \\cite{Rivera2013} and some interesting examples of the derivatives, defined at the points where the functions themselves are undefined, are provided. However, the hunt for misconceptions takes another twist for the derivatives undefined at the points where the functions are in fact defined.\n\nThe expression of the derivative of the function obtained using differentiation techniques does not necessarily contain the information about the existence or the value of the derivative at the points, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. In this article we discuss a type of continuous functions that have the expression for the derivative undefined at a certain point, while the derivative itself at that point exists. We show, how relying on the formula for the derivative for finding the horizontal tangent line of a function, leads to a false conclusion and consequently to missing a solution. We also provide a simple methodological treatment of similar functions suitable for the classroom.\n\n\\section{Calculating the Derivative}\n\nIn order to illustrate how deceitful the expression of the derivative can be to a students' eye, let us consider the following problem.\n\n\\vspace{12pt}\n\n\\fbox{\\begin{minipage}{5.25in}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{minipage}{5.0in}\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\n\\emph{Problem}\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\nDifferentiate the function $f\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$. For which values of $x$ from the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ does the graph of $f\\left(x\\right)$ have a horizontal tangent?\n\n\\vspace{10pt}\n\n\\end{minipage}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{minipage}}\n\n\\vspace{12pt}\n\nProblems with similar formulations can be found in many Calculus books \\cite{Stewart2012}, \\cite{Larson2010}, \\cite{Thomas2009}. Following the common procedure, let us find the expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ applying the Product Rule:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\left(\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)'\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\left(\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)'\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \\\\ &=& \\frac{6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\label{DerivativeExpression}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nSimilar to \\cite{Stewart2012}, we find the values of $x$ where the derivative $f'\\left(x\\right)$ is equal to zero:\n\\begin{equation}\n6x^2\\cos{x^2}+\\sin{x^2} = 0 \n\\label{DerivativeEqualZero}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSince the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}) is not defined at $x=0$, it is not hard to see that for all values of $x$ from $\\left[-1,1\\right]$ distinct from zero, the left-hand side of (\\ref{DerivativeEqualZero}) is always positive. Hence, we conclude that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ does not have horizontal tangent lines on the interval $\\left[-1,1\\right]$.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the graph of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ seems to point at a different result: there is a horizontal tangent at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:FunctionGraph}). \n\nFirst, note that the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined in $x=0$. In order to verify if it has a horizontal tangent at this point, let us find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ using definition:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(0\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(0+h\\right)-f\\left(0\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{h}\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{h} \\cdot {h} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}\\right)} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{h} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(h^2\\right)}}{h^2}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& 0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1 = 0 \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nsince each of the limits above exists. We see that, indeed, the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ possesses a horizontal tangent line at the point $x=0$.\n\n\\section{Closer Look at the Expression for the Derivative}\n\nWhat is the problem with the standard procedure proposed by many textbooks and repeated in every Calculus class? The explanation lies in the following premise: the expression of the derivative of the function does not contain the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points where it is undefined. As it is pointed out in \\cite{Rivera2013}, the domain of the derivative is determined \\emph{a priori} and therefore should not be obtained from the formula of the derivative itself.\n\nIn the example above the Product Law for derivatives requires the existence of the derivatives of both functions at the point of interest. Since the function $\\sqrt[3]{x}$ is not differentiable in zero, the Product Rule cannot be applied. \n\nIn order to see what exactly happens when we apply the Product Rule, let us find the expression for the derivative using definition of the derivative:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf'\\left(x\\right) &=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{f\\left(x+h\\right)-f\\left(x\\right)}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\notag \\\\ \n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)}{h}\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} + \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\left(\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}\\right)}{h}\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}} +  \\notag \\\\&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}} \\cdot \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}} \\notag \\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}} \\cdot \\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}+2x\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{x} \\notag \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich seems to be identical to the expression (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}).\n\nStudents are expected to develop a skill of deriving similar results and know how to find the derivative of the function using definition of the derivative only. But how `legal' are the performed operations?\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{sin.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us consider each of the following limits: \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}}{h}} \\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sin{\\left(x+h\\right)^2}-\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{h}}\\notag \\\\\n&& \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\sqrt[3]{x+h}}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nThe last three limits exist for all real values of the variable $x$. However, the first limit does not exist when $x=0$. Indeed\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{0+h}-\\sqrt[3]{0}}{h}} = \\lim_{h\\rightarrow0}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{h^2}}} = + \\infty\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis implies that the Product and Sum Laws for limits cannot be applied and therefore this step is not justifiable in the case of $x=0$. When the derivation is performed, we automatically assume the conditions, under which the Product Law for limits can be applied, i.e. that both limits that are multiplied exist. It is not hard to see that in our case these conditions are actually equivalent to $x\\neq0$. This is precisely why, when we wrote out the expression for the derivative (\\ref{DerivativeExpression}), it already contained the assumption that it is only true for the values of $x$ that are different from zero.\n\nNote, that in the case of $x=0$ the application of the Product and Sum Laws for limits is not necessary, since the term $\\left(\\sqrt[3]{x+h}-\\sqrt[3]{x}\\right)\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}$ vanishes.\n\nThe correct expression for the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ should be the following:\n\\begin{equation*}\nf'\\left(x\\right)  = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\frac{6x^2\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}+\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}, & \\mbox{if } x \\neq 0 \\\\ \n0, & \\mbox{if } x = 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe expression for the derivative of the function provides the correct value of the derivative only for those values of the independent variable, for which the expression is defined; it does not tell anything about the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression for the derivative is undefined. Indeed, let us consider the function\n\\begin{equation*}\ng\\left(x\\right) = {\\sqrt[3]{x}}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}\n\\end{equation*}\nand its derivative $g'\\left(x\\right)$ \n\\begin{equation*}\ng'\\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}-6x^2\\sin{\\left(x^2\\right)}}{3\\sqrt[3]{x^2}}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSimilar to the previous example, the expression for the derivative is undefined at $x=0$. Nonetheless, it can be shown that $g\\left(x\\right)$ is not differentiable at $x=0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig:GFunction}). Therefore, we provided two visually similar functions: both have the expressions for their derivatives undefined in zero, however, one of these functions possesses a derivative, but the other one does not.\n\n\\section{Methodological Remarks}\n\nUnfortunately, there exist many functions similar to the ones discussed above and they can arise in a variety of typical Calculus problems: finding the points where the tangent line is horizontal, finding an equation of the tangent and normal lines to the curve at the given point, the use of differentials and graph sketching. Relying only on the expression of the derivative for determining its value at the undefined points may lead to missing a solution (as in the example discussed above) or to some completely false interpretations (as in the case of curve sketching).\n\nAs it was discussed above, the expression for the derivative does not provide any information on the existence or the value of the derivative, where the expression itself is undefined. Here we present a methodology for the analysis of this type of functions.\n\nLet $f\\left(x\\right)$ be the function of interest and $f'\\left(x\\right)$ be the expression of its derivative undefined at some point $x_{0}$. In order to find out if $f\\left(x\\right)$ is differentiable at $x_{0}$, we suggest to follow a list of steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item Check if the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ itself is defined at the point $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is undefined at $x_{0}$, then it is not differentiable at $x_{0}$. If $f\\left(x\\right)$ is defined at $x_{0}$, then proceed to next step. \n  \\item Identify the basic functions that are used in the formula of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$, that are themselves defined at the point $x_{0}$, but their derivative is not (such as, for example, the root functions).\n\t\\item Find the derivative of the function $f\\left(x\\right)$ at the point $x_{0}$ using definition.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe importance of the first step comes from the fact that most students tend to pay little attention to the functions domain analysis when asked to investigate its derivative. Formally, the second step can be skipped, however it will give the students the insight into which part of the function presents a problem and teach them to identify similar cases in the future. the difficulty of accomplishing the third step depends on the form of the function and sometimes can be tedious. Nevertheless, it allows the students to apply the previously obtained skills and encourages the review of the material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=6.0in]{cos.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{.1in}\n\t\\caption{Graph of the function $g\\left(x\\right)=\\sqrt[3]{x}\\cos{\\left(x^2\\right)}$}\n\t\\label{fig:GFunction}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe discussed the misconception, that the expression of the derivative of the function contains the information as to whether the function is differentiable or not at the points, where the expression is undefined. We considered a typical Calculus problem of looking for the horizontal tangent line of a function as an example. We showed how the search for the values that make the expression of the derivative equal zero leads to missing a solution: even though the expression of the derivative is undefined, the function still possesses the derivative at the point. We provided an example of the function that similarly has the expression for the derivative undefined, however the function is not differentiable at the point. We also presented the methodological treatment of such functions by applying the definition of the derivative, which can be used in the classroom.\n\n", "answers": ["It depends on the value of x, either 0 or (6x^2cos(x^2)+sin(x^2))/(3(x^2)^(1/3))."], "length": 1762, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "101225d103936ad083c5da47c3dce73ce569b62cbaa093bd"}
{"input": "What award did Brooksley Born receive in 2009?", "context": "Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.\n\nLegal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.\n\nDuring her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).\n\nBorn and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.\n\nIn 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.\n\nBorn declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.\n\n Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAttorney profile at Arnold & Porter\nBrooksley Born (2009 Winner) of the Profiles in Courage Award, with acceptance speech transcript and NECN video\n\nProfile at MarketsWiki\nSpeeches and statements\n\"Testimony Of Brooksley Born Chairperson of the CFTC Concerning The Over-The-Counter Derivatives Market\", before the House Committee On Banking And Financial Services, July 24, 1998.\n\"The Lessons of Long Term Capital Management L.P.\", Remarks of Brooksley Born, Chairperson of the CFTC, Chicago-Kent-IIT Commodities Law Institute, Chicago, Illinois, October 15, 1998.\n Interview: Brooksley Born for \"PBS Frontline: The Warning\", PBS, (streaming VIDEO 1 hour), October 20, 2009.\nArticles\nManuel Roig-Franzia. \"Credit Crisis Cassandra:Brooksley Born's Unheeded Warning Is a Rueful Echo 10 Years On\", The Washington Post, May 26, 2009\n Taibbi, Matt. \"The Great American Bubble Machine\", Rolling Stone'', July 9–23, 2009\n\n1940 births\nAmerican women lawyers\nArnold & Porter people\nClinton administration personnel\nColumbus School of Law faculty\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission personnel\nHeads of United States federal agencies\nLawyers from San Francisco\nLiving people\nStanford Law School alumni\n21st-century American women\nStanford University alumni", "answers": ["In 2009, Brooksley Born received the John F.

{"input": "What hedge fund's collapse in 1998 highlighted the need for regulation of derivatives?", "context": "Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.\n\nIn 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.\n\nLegal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.\n\nDuring her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).\n\nBorn and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.\n\nIn 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.\n\nBorn declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.\n\n Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAttorney profile at Arnold & Porter\nBrooksley Born (2009 Winner) of the Profiles in Courage Award, with acceptance speech transcript and NECN video\n\nProfile at MarketsWiki\nSpeeches and statements\n\"Testimony Of Brooksley Born Chairperson of the CFTC Concerning The Over-The-Counter Derivatives Market\", before the House Committee On Banking And Financial Services, July 24, 1998.\n\"The Lessons of Long Term Capital Management L.P.\", Remarks of Brooksley Born, Chairperson of the CFTC, Chicago-Kent-IIT Commodities Law Institute, Chicago, Illinois, October 15, 1998.\n Interview: Brooksley Born for \"PBS Frontline: The Warning\", PBS, (streaming VIDEO 1 hour), October 20, 2009.\nArticles\nManuel Roig-Franzia. \"Credit Crisis Cassandra:Brooksley Born's Unheeded Warning Is a Rueful Echo 10 Years On\", The Washington Post, May 26, 2009\n Taibbi, Matt. \"The Great American Bubble Machine\", Rolling Stone'', July 9–23, 2009\n\n1940 births\nAmerican women lawyers\nArnold & Porter people\nClinton administration personnel\nColumbus School of Law faculty\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission personnel\nHeads of United States federal agencies\nLawyers from San Francisco\nLiving people\nStanford Law School alumni\n21st-century American women\n", "answers": ["Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)."], "length": 2091, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a013f691a7063527fa4e7a4b357081c76656af3cd402a27a"}
{"input": "What is the dynamical behavior of the anisotropic order parameter following a quench to the critical point?", "context": "\\section*{Dynamical Behaviour of $O$ in Lattice Gases}\n\nThe dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order parameter  $m$ [see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-m} in the Letter] following a quench to the critical point is well described by\nthe Gaussian theory for all the three lattice gas models studied, $i.e.,$ driven lattice gas with either constant (IDLG) or random (RDLG) infinite drive and equilibrium lattice gas (LG). In other words, in the short-time regime, $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:mt}] and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode [defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:binder}] is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter $O,$ however, distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. \n\nIn order to understand  this, we first write the phenomenological scaling form for $O$,  analogous to Eq. \\eqref{eq:scalingass} in  the Letter,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO (t, L_{\\parallel} ; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O (t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)} ; S_\\Delta).\\quad\n\\label{eq:Oscalingass}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe already remarked that, in the LG, this scaling form is not compatible with the prediction $O \\sim t^{1/8}  L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$ of the Gaussian theory.  However, following Ref. \\cite{AS2002}, it can be argued that, at short times, the only dependence of $O$ on the system size $L_{\\parallel}$ is of the form $O \\sim L_\\parallel^{-1/2}$ which is very well confirmed by numerical simulations. Accordingly,  the generic behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_\\parallel^{-1/2}, \\label{eq:O}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined. This, along with Eq. \\eqref{eq:Oscalingass}, implies $\\tilde f_O(x) \\sim x^{\\alpha}.$ Comparing the finite-size behaviour in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:O} with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:Oscalingass} one actually infers,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\alpha &=& \\frac{1+ \\Delta -2 \\beta/\\nu}{2 \\, (4- \\eta)}. \\label{eq:alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis equation, together with the hyperscaling relation $\\Delta - 2 \\beta/\\nu= - \\eta$ in two spatial dimensions, shows that the prediction $\\alpha = 1/8$ of the Gaussian theory [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:Ot}] can be obtained only when $\\eta=0,$ which is the case for the IDLG (exactly) and the RDLG (approximately) but not for the LG. \n\nOn the other hand,  Eq.~\\eqref{eq:alpha} predicts $\\alpha = 1/10$ upon substituting the values of the critical exponents corresponding to the Ising  universality class (LG). This is consistent with the numerical simulation results presented in the main text, see Fig. \\ref{fig:ising}(b) therein.\n\n\\begin{figure}[th]\n\\vspace*{0.2 cm}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{./compare_binder.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Comparison between the temporal evolution of the Binder cumulants $g$ corresponding to the $12^{th}$ transverse mode, $i.e.,$ with $n_\\perp =12,$ in the LG (lowest curve), IDLG and RDLG (two upper curves) on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. \\label{fig:b}}\n \\label{fig:binder}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe emergence of this new value $1/10$ of the exponent $\\alpha$ must be traced back to the non-Gaussian nature of higher fluctuating modes in the LG. In fact, even though the lowest mode behaves identically in all the three models we considered,  characterized by the same behaviour of $m$, higher modes show a significant difference in the non-driven case.  \n\n\nTo illustrate this, we measured the Binder cumulants of higher modes which is defined  analogously to Eq.~(11), using transverse modes other than the first, i.e., with $\\mu=\\tilde \\sigma(0,2 \\pi n_\\bot/L_\\bot)$ and $n_\\bot>1.$  \n Figure \\ref{fig:b} compares the same for all the three lattice gases for the mode with $n_\\perp =12$ on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. Clearly, the curve corresponding to the LG (lowest, blue) departs from Gaussian behaviour $g=0$ (in practice, $e.g.,$ $|g| \\lesssim 0.005,$ corresponding to the shaded gray area) much earlier than it does for the IDLG  or RDLG (two upper curves, red and green respectively).\n\nAccordingly, the different dynamical behaviour of $O$, which involves a sum over all modes, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian nature of the higher modes in the LG. \nSuch a departure is not entirely surprising. In fact, for higher modes, mesoscopic descriptions such as the ones in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:L-DLG} or \\eqref{eq:g_evol} are not expected to hold, while the anisotropy at the microscopic level could be the mechanism leading to the Gaussianity of higher modes in the driven models.\n\n", "answers": ["It is well described by the Gaussian theory."], "length": 669, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "322b4b2b074049aac101086797d655a21671ef5a9f366353"}

The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.\n\n Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.  When both of her children were school-age, Born returned to practice full-time.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAttorney profile at Arnold & Porter\nBrooksley Born (2009 Winner) of the Profiles in Courage Award, with acceptance speech transcript and NECN video\n\nProfile at MarketsWiki\nSpeeches and statements\n\"Testimony Of Brooksley Born Chairperson of the CFTC Concerning The Over-The-Counter Derivatives Market\", before the House Committee On Banking And Financial Services, July 24, 1998.\n\"The Lessons of Long Term Capital Management L.P.\", Remarks of Brooksley Born, Chairperson of the CFTC, Chicago-Kent-IIT Commodities Law Institute, Chicago, Illinois, October 15, 1998.\n Interview: Brooksley Born for \"PBS Frontline: The Warning\", PBS, (streaming VIDEO 1 hour), October 20, 2009.\nArticles\nManuel Roig-Franzia. \"Credit Crisis Cassandra:Brooksley Born's Unheeded Warning Is a Rueful Echo 10 Years On\", The Washington Post, May 26, 2009\n Taibbi, Matt. \"The Great American Bubble Machine\", Rolling Stone'', July 9–23, 2009\n\n1940 births\nAmerican women lawyers\nArnold & Porter people\nClinton administration personnel\nColumbus School of Law faculty\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission personnel\nHeads of United States federal agencies\nLawyers from San Francisco\nLiving people\nStanford Law School alumni\n21st-century American women\nStanford University alumni", "answers": ["June 1, 1999."], "length": 2088, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2d48bbc2bd6052c5e67824752a9296cbbc26351616cd6d7e"}
{"input": "When did the 2017 general election be held?", "context": "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.\n\nA farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.\n\nIn November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.\n\nJohn Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.\n\nEarly life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.\n\nEnglish attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented.\n\nEnglish joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.\n\nFourth National Government (1990–1999)\n\nAt the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.\n\nFirst period in cabinet (1996–1999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.\n\nAs Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.\n\nBy early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.\n\nEnglish was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\".\n\nOpposition (1999–2008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\".\n\nAged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as \"the worst day of my political life\". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.\n\nBy late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.\n\nShadow cabinet roles and deputy leader\nOn 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).\n\nIn November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.\n\nFifth National Government (2008–2017)\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)\n\nAt the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.\n\nHe was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. \n\nThe pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).\n\nEnglish acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.\n\nIn April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.\n\nStrong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.\n\nAllowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.\n\nPrime Minister (2016–2017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.\n\nEnglish appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.\n\nIn February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.\n\nIn his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.\n\nAt a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.\n\nOn 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.\n\nDuring the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.\n\nOpposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.\n\nPost-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.\n\nPolitical and social views\n\nEnglish is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law.\n\nIn 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\".\n\nIn 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.\n\nPersonal life \nEnglish met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.\n\nEnglish is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.\n\nIn June 2002, English took part in TV3's Fight For Life, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.\n\nHonours\nIn the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, English was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services of over 27 years to the State.", "answers": ["23 September."], "length": 3422, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "94ccf4d54b36e7e9d4aa594a7bc426528630a5b8aff296a4"}

Furthermore, the magnetic potential energy vanishes $H(t) = 0$.\n\nIn a second system we model the inhomogeneous magnetic field present in tokamaks as\n$\\vec B := B_0 (1+ x/R_0)^{-1}\\hat z$ and neglect the gravitational drift $\\vec u_g = 0$.\nThen, the potential energy $G(t) = 0$. \nNote that \n$H(t) = m_i \\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0\\int\\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0) +\\mathcal O(R_0^{-2}) $\nreduces to $G(t)$ with the effective gravity $g_\\text{eff}:= \\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2/R_0$ with $\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}^2 := T_e/m_i$. \nFor the rest of this letter we treat $g$ and $g_\\text{eff}$ as well as $G(t)$ and $H(t)$ on the same footing.\nThe magnetic field inhomogeneity thus entails compressible flows, which is \nthe only difference to the model describing dynamics in a homogeneous magnetic field introduced above. \nSince both $S(t)\\geq 0$ and $E(t)\\geq 0$ we further derive from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:energyb} that the kinetic energy\nis bounded by $E(t) \\leq T_eS(t) + E(t) = T_e S(0)$; a feature absent from the gravitational system with \nincompressible flows, where $S(t) = S(0)$. \n\nWe now show that the invariants Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:energya} and \\eqref{eq:energyb} present restrictions on the velocity and\nacceleration of plasma blobs. \nFirst, we define the blobs' center of mass (COM) via $X(t):= \\int\\mathrm{dA}\\, x(n-n_0)/M$ and \nits COM velocity as $V(t):=\\d X(t)/\\d t$. \nThe latter is proportional to the total radial particle flux~\\cite{Garcia_Bian_Fundamensky_POP_2006, Held2016a}.\nWe assume\nthat $n>n_0$ and $(n-n_0)^2/2 \\leq [ n\\ln (n/n_0) - (n-n_0)]n $ to show for both systems \n\\begin{align}\n  (MV)^2 &= \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, n{\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\n  = \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, (n-n_0){\\phi_y}/{B} \\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n&\\leq 2 \\left( \\int \\mathrm{dA}\\, \\left[n\\ln (n/n_0) -(n-n_0)\\right]^{1/2}\\sqrt{n}{\\phi_y}/{B}\\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\\n \n  &\\leq 4 S(0) E(t)/m_i \n \n  \\label{eq:inequality}\n\\end{align}\nHere we use the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and \n$\\phi_y:=\\partial\\phi/\\partial y$. \nNote that although we derive the inequality Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality} only for amplitudes $\\triangle n >0$  we assume that the results also hold for depletions. This is justified by our numerical results later in this letter. \nIf we initialize our density field with a seeded blob of radius $\\ell$ and amplitude $\\triangle n$ as \n\\begin{align}\n  n(\\vec x, 0) &= n_0 + \\triangle n \\exp\\left( -\\frac{\\vec x^2}{2\\ell^2} \\right), \\label{eq:inita}\n \n \n\\end{align}\nand  \n$\\phi(\\vec x, 0 ) = 0$,\nwe immediately have $M := M(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 \\triangle n$, $E(0) = G(0) = 0$ and \n$S(0) = 2\\pi \\ell^2 f(\\triangle n)$, where $f(\\triangle n)$ captures the amplitude dependence of \nthe integral for $S(0)$. \n\nThe acceleration for both incompressible and compressible flows can be estimated\nby assuming a linear acceleration $V=A_0t$ and $X=A_0t^2/2$~\\cite{Held2016a} and using \n$E(t) = G(t) = m_igMX(t)$ in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality}\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{A_0}{g} =  \\mathcal Q\\frac{2S(0)}{M} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{\\triangle n }{n_0+2\\triangle n/9}.\n  \\label{eq:acceleration}\n\\end{align}\nHere, we use the Pad\\'e approximation of order $(1/1)$ of $2S(0)/M $\nand define a model parameter $\\mathcal Q$ with $0<\\mathcal Q\\leq1$ to be determined by numerical simulations.\nNote that the Pad\\'e approximation is a better approximation than a simple \ntruncated Taylor expansion especially for large relative amplitudes of order unity.\nEq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} predicts that $A_0/g\\sim \\triangle n/n_0$ for small \namplitudes $|\\triangle n/n_0| < 1$ and $A_0 \\sim g $ for very large amplitudes $\\triangle n /n_0 \\gg 1$, \nwhich confirms the predictions in~\\cite{Pecseli2016} and reproduces the limits discussed in~\\cite{Angus2014}.\n\nAs pointed out earlier for compressible flows Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inequality} can be further estimated\n\\begin{align}\n  (MV)^2  \\leq 4 T_eS(0)^2/m_i. \n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nWe therefore have a restriction on the maximum COM velocity for compressible flows, which is absent for incompressible flows\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = {\\mathcal Q}\\frac{2S(0)}{M} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n| }{n_0+2/9 \\triangle n } \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n|}{n_0}.\n  \\label{eq:linear}\n\\end{align}\nFor $|\\triangle n /n_0|< 1$ Eq.~\\eqref{eq:linear} reduces to the linear scaling derived in~\\cite{Kube2016}. \nFinally, a scale analysis of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vorticity} shows that~\\cite{Ott1978, Garcia2005, Held2016a}\n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = \\mathcal R \\left( \\frac{\\ell}{R_0}\\frac{|\\triangle n|}{n_0} \\right)^{1/2}.\n  \\label{eq:sqrt}\n\\end{align}\nThis equation predicts a square root dependence of the center of mass velocity \non amplitude and size. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe now propose a simple phenomenological model that captures the essential dynamics\nof blobs and depletions in the previously stated systems. More specifically \nthe model reproduces the acceleration Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} with and without\nBoussinesq approximation, the square root scaling for the COM velocity \nEq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} for incompressible flows as well as the relation between the \nsquare root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} and the linear scaling \nEq.~\\eqref{eq:linear} for compressible flows. \nThe basic idea is that the COM of blobs behaves like \nthe one of an infinitely long plasma column immersed in an ambient plasma. \nThe dynamics of this column reduces to the one of a two-dimensional ball.\nThis idea is similar to the analytical ``top hat'' density solution for\nblob dynamics recently studied in~\\cite{Pecseli2016}.\nThe ball is subject to buoyancy as well as linear and nonlinear friction\n\\begin{align}\n  M_{\\text{i}} \\frac{d V}{d t} = (M_{\\text{g}} - M_\\text{p}) g - c_1 V  - \\mathrm{sgn}(V ) \\frac{1}{2}c_2 V^2.\n  \\label{eq:ball}\n\\end{align}\nThe gravity $g$ has a positive sign in the coordinate system; sgn$(f)$ is the sign function. \nThe first term on the right hand side is the buoyancy, where \n$M_{\\text{g}} := \\pi \\ell^2 (n_0 + \\mathcal Q \\triangle n/2)$ \nis the gravitational mass of the ball with radius $\\ell$ and \n$M_\\mathrm{p} := n_0 \\pi \\ell^2 $ \nis the mass of the displaced ambient plasma.\nNote that if $\\triangle n<0$ the ball represents a depletion and the buoyancy term has a negative sign, i.e. the depletion will rise. \nWe introduce an inertial mass \n$M_{\\text{i}} := \\pi\\ell^2 (n_0 +2\\triangle n/9)$ \ndifferent from the gravitational mass $M_{\\text{g}}$ in order to \nrecover the initial acceleration in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration}. \nWe interpret the parameters $\\mathcal Q$ and $2/9$ as geometrical factors \nthat capture the difference of the actual blob form from the idealized\n``top hat'' solution. \nAlso note that the Boussinesq approximation appears in the model as a neglect of inertia, $M_{\\text{i}} = \\pi\\ell^2n_0$.\n\nThe second term is the linear friction term with coefficient $c_1(\\ell)$, which\ndepends on the size of the ball.\nIf we disregard the nonlinear friction, $c_2=0$, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ball} directly yields a \nmaximum velocity $c_1V^*=\\pi \\ell^2 n g \\mathcal Q\\triangle n/2$.\nFrom our previous considerations $\\max V/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}=\\mathcal Q \\triangle n /2n_0$, we thus identify \n\\begin{align}\n  c_1 = \\pi\\ell^2 n_0 g/\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}. \n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nThe linear friction coefficient thus depends on the gravity and the size of the\nball. \n\nThe last term in \\eqref{eq:ball} is the nonlinear friction. The sign of the force depends on whether\nthe ball rises or falls in the ambient plasma. \nIf we disregard linear friction $c_1=0$, we have the maximum velocity \n$V^*= \\sigma(\\triangle n)\\sqrt{\\pi \\ell^2|\\triangle n| g\\mathcal Q/c_2}$, \nwhich must equal \n$\\max V= \\sigma(\\triangle n) \\mathcal R \\sqrt{g \\ell |\\triangle n/n_0|}$ \nand thus\n\\begin{align}\n  c_2 = {\\mathcal Q\\pi n_0\\ell }/{\\mathcal R^2}.\n  \\label{}\n\\end{align}\nInserting $c_1$ and $c_2$ into Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ball}\nwe can derive the maximum absolute velocity in the form \n\\begin{align}\n  \\frac{\\max |V|}{\\ensuremath{C_\\mathrm{s}}} = \n        \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal R^2}{\\mathcal Q}\\right) \\frac{\\ell}{R_0} \\left( \n        \\left({1+\\left( \\frac{\\mathcal Q}{\\mathcal R} \\right)^{2} \\frac{|\\triangle n|/n_0 }{\\ell/R_0}}\\right)^{1/2}-1 \\right)\n  \\label{eq:vmax_theo}\n\\end{align}\nand thus have a concise expression for $\\max |V|$ that captures both the linear\nscaling \\eqref{eq:linear} as well as the square root scaling \\eqref{eq:sqrt}.\nWith Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration} and Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} respectively Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} we \nfinally arrive at an analytical expression for the time at which the maximum velocity is reached via \n$t_{\\max V} \\sim \\max V/A_0$. Its inverse $\\gamma:=t_{\\max V}^{-1}$ gives the\nglobal interchange growth rate, for which an empirical expression was\npresented in Reference~\\cite{Held2016a}.\n\n\nWe use the open source library FELTOR \nto simulate \nEqs.~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:vorticity} with and without \ndrift compression.\nFor numerical stabilty we added small diffusive terms on the right hand \nsides of the equations.\nThe discontinuous Galerkin methods employ three polynomial coefficients and a minimum of $N_x=N_y=768$ grid cells. The box size is $50\\ell$ in order to mitigate \ninfluences of the finite box size on the blob dynamics. \nMoreover, we used the invariants in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:energya} and \\eqref{eq:energyb} as consistency tests to verify the code and repeated simulations \nalso in a gyrofluid model. \nNo differences to the results presented here were found. \nInitial perturbations on the particle density field are given by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:inita},\nwhere the perturbation amplitude $\\triangle n/n_0$ was chosen between $10^{-3}$ and $20$ for blobs and $-10^0$ and $ -10^{-3}$ for depletions. \nDue to computational reasons we show results only for $\\triangle n/n_0\\leq 20$. \n\n\nFor compressible flows we consider two different cases $\\ell/R_0 = 10^{-2}$ and\n$\\ell /R_0 = 10^{-3}$. \n For incompressible flows Eq.~\\eqref{eq:generala} and \\eqref{eq:vorticity}\n can be normalized such that the blob radius is absent from the equations~\\cite{Ott1978, Kube2012}. \n The simulations of incompressible flows can thus be used for both sizes. \nThe numerical code as well as input parameters and output data can be found \nin the supplemental dataset to this contribution~\\cite{Data2017}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{com_blobs}\n    \\caption{\n      The maximum radial COM velocities of blobs for compressible and incompressible flows are shown. \n      The continuous lines show Eq.~\\eqref{eq:vmax_theo} while the \n      dashed line shows the square root scaling Eq.~\\eqref{eq:sqrt} with \n      $\\mathcal Q = 0.32$ and $\\mathcal R=0.85$.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:com_blobs}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:com_blobs} we plot the maximum COM velocity for blobs \nwith and without drift compression.\nFor incompressible flows blobs follow the square root scaling almost \nperfectly.

While the acceleration of blobs is reduced for large \namplitudes compared to a linear dependence the acceleration \nof depletions is increased. In the language of our simple buoyancy \nmodel the inertia of depletions is reduced but increased for blobs. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion  \n  we discuss the dynamics of seeded blobs and depletions in a \n  compressible and an incompressible system.\n  With only two fit parameters our theoretical results reproduce the \n  numerical COM velocities and accelerations over five orders of magnitude.\n  We derive the amplitude dependence of the acceleration of blobs and depletions from \n  the conservation laws of our systems in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:acceleration}. \n  From the same inequality a linear regime is derived in the compressible system for \n  ratios of amplitudes to sizes smaller than a critical value.\n   In this regime \n  the blob and depletion velocity depends linearly on the initial amplitude and \n  is independent of size. The regime is absent from the system with incompressible flows.\n  Our theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations for all \n  amplitudes that are relevant in magnetic fusion devices.\n  Finally, we suggest a new empirical blob model that captures the detailed dynamics of more complicated models. \n  The Boussinesq approximation is clarified as the absence of inertia and a thus altered acceleration of blobs and depletions.\n  The maximum blob velocity is not altered by the Boussinesq approximation.\n\nThe authors were supported with financial subvention from the Research Council of Norway under grant\n240510/F20.

{"input": "What algorithm is engaged in the PLMS-PPIC method?", "context": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{S1}\n\nThe multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user\nlimitation in CDMA systems \\cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean\nsquare-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method\nis a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)\nreceivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this\nmethod and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \\cite{R5}\n(see also \\cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is\nsubtracted before making the decision for a specific user in\ndifferent stages \\cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity.\nUnlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC.\nIn each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \\ref{S4}\nthe modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase\nestimation is introduced. In section \\ref{S5} some simulation\nexamples illustrate the results of the proposed method. Finally the\npaper is concluded in section \\ref{S6}.\n\n\\section{Multistage Parallel Interference Cancelation: Modified PLMS-PPIC Method}\\label{S4}\n\nWe assume $M$ users synchronously send their symbols\n$\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\cdots,\\alpha_M$ via a base-band CDMA\ntransmission system where $\\alpha_m\\in\\{-1,1\\}$. The $m^{th}$ user\nhas its own code $p_m(.)$ of length $N$, where $p_m(n)\\in \\{-1,1\\}$,\nfor all $n$. It means that for each symbol $N$ bits are transmitted\nby each user and the processing gain is equal to $N$. At the\nreceiver we assume that perfect power control scheme is applied.\nWithout loss of generality, we also assume that the power gains of\nall channels are equal to unity and users' channels do not change\nduring each symbol transmission (it can change from one symbol\ntransmission to the next one) and the channel phase $\\phi_m$ of\n$m^{th}$ user is unknown for all $m=1,2,\\cdots,M$ (see\n\\cite{cohpaper} for coherent transmission). According to the above\nassumptions the received signal is\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e1} r(n)=\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}\\alpha_m\ne^{j\\phi_m}p_m(n)+v(n),~~~~n=1,2,\\cdots,N,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $v(n)$ is the additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nvariance $\\sigma^2$. Multistage parallel interference cancelation\nmethod uses $\\alpha^{s-1}_1,\\alpha^{s-1}_2,\\cdots,\\alpha^{s-1}_M$,\nthe bit estimates outputs of the previous stage, $s-1$, to estimate\nthe related MAI of each user. It then subtracts it from the received\nsignal $r(n)$ and makes a new decision on each user variable\nindividually to make a new variable set\n$\\alpha^{s}_1,\\alpha^{s}_2,\\cdots,\\alpha^{s}_M$ for the current\nstage $s$. Usually the variable set of the first stage (stage $0$)\nis the output of a conventional detector. The output of the last\nstage is considered as the final estimate of transmitted bits. In\nthe following we explain the structure of a modified version of the\nPLMS-PIC method \\cite{cohpaper} with simultaneous capability of\nestimating the cancelation weights and the channel phases.\n\nAssume $\\alpha_m^{(s-1)}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ is a given estimate of\n$\\alpha_m$ from stage $s-1$. Define\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e6} w^s_{m}=\\frac{\\alpha_m}{\\alpha_m^{(s-1)}}e^{j\\phi_m}.\n\\end{equation}\nFrom (\\ref{e1}) and (\\ref{e6}) we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e7} r(n)=\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}w^s_m\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m\np_m(n)+v(n).\n\\end{equation}\nDefine\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{e8} W^s&=&[w^s_{1},w^s_{2},\\cdots,w^s_{M}]^T,\\\\\n\\label{e9}\n\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!X^{s}(n)\\!\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\![\\alpha^{(s-1)}_1p_1(n),\\alpha^{(s-1)}_2p_2(n),\\cdots,\\alpha^{(s-1)}_Mp_M(n)]^T.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere $T$ stands for transposition. From equations (\\ref{e7}),\n(\\ref{e8}) and (\\ref{e9}), we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e10} r(n)=W^{s^T}X^{s}(n)+v(n).\n\\end{equation}\nGiven the observations $\\{r(n),X^{s}(n)\\}^{N}_{n=1}$, in modified\nPLMS-PPIC, like the PLMS-PPIC \\cite{cohpaper}, a set of NLMS\nadaptive algorithm are used to compute\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{te1} W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich is an estimate of $W^s$ after iteration $N$. To do so, from\n(\\ref{e6}), we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e13} |w^s_{m}|=1 ~~~m=1,2,\\cdots,M,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich is equivalent to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e14} \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m}|-1|=0.\n\\end{equation}\nWe divide $\\Psi=\\left(0,1-\\sqrt{\\frac{M-1}{M}}\\right]$, a sharp\nrange for $\\mu$ (the step-size of the NLMS algorithm) given in\n\\cite{sg2005}, into $L$ subintervals and consider $L$ individual\nstep-sizes $\\Theta=\\{\\mu_1,\\mu_2,\\cdots,\\mu_L\\}$, where\n$\\mu_1=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{\\frac{M-1}{M}}}{L}, \\mu_2=2\\mu_1,\\cdots$, and\n$\\mu_L=L\\mu_1$. In each stage, $L$ individual NLMS algorithms are\nexecuted ($\\mu_l$ is the step-size of the $l^{th}$ algorithm). In\nstage $s$ and at iteration $n$, if\n$W^{s}_k(n)=[w^s_{1,k},\\cdots,w^s_{M,k}]^T$, the parameter estimate\nof the $k^{\\rm th}$ algorithm, minimizes our criteria, then it is\nconsidered as the parameter estimate at time iteration $n$. In other\nwords if the next equation holds\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e17} W^s_k(n)=\\arg\\min\\limits_{W^s_l(n)\\in I_{W^s}\n}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m,l}(n)|-1|\\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $W^{s}_l(n)=W^{s}(n-1)+\\mu_l \\frac{X^s(n)}{\\|X^s(n)\\|^2}e(n),\n~~~ l=1,2,\\cdots,k,\\cdots,L-1,L$ and\n$I_{W^s}=\\{W^s_1(n),\\cdots,W^s_L(n)\\}$, then we have\n$W^s(n)=W^s_k(n)$, and therefore all other algorithms replace their\nweight estimate by $W^{s}_k(n)$. At time instant $n=N$, this\nprocedure gives $W^s(N)$, the final estimate of $W^s$, as the true\nparameter of stage $s$.\n\nNow consider $R=(0,2\\pi)$ and divide it into four equal parts\n$R_1=(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $R_2=(\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi)$,\n$R_3=(\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2})$ and $R_4=(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2\\pi)$. The\npartial information of channel phases (given by the receiver) is in\na way that it shows each $\\phi_m$ ($m=1,2,\\cdots,M$) belongs to\nwhich one of the four quarters $R_i,~i=1,2,3,4$. Assume\n$W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T$ is the weight\nestimate of the modified algorithm PLMS-PPIC at time instant $N$ of\nthe stage $s$. From equation (\\ref{e6}) we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{tt3}\n\\phi_m=\\angle({\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}w^s_m}).\n\\end{equation}\nWe estimate $\\phi_m$ by $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m$, where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ee3}\n\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\angle{(\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}w^s_m(N))}.\n\\end{equation}\nBecause $\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=1$ or $-1$, we have\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\angle{w^s_m(N)} &\n\\mbox{if}~\n\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=1\\\\\n\\pm\\pi+\\angle{w^s_m(N)} & \\mbox{if}~\n\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=-1\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHence $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m\\in P^s=\\{\\angle{w^s_m(N)},\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)+\\pi, \\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi}\\}$. If $w^s_m(N)$\nsufficiently converges to its true value $w^s_m$, the same region\nfor $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m$ and $\\phi_m$ is expected. In this case only one\nof the three members of $P^s$ has the same region as $\\phi_m$. For\nexample if $\\phi_m \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, then $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m \\in\n(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and therefore only $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}$ or\n$\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi$ or $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi$ belongs to\n$(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$. If, for example, $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi$ is such\na member between all three members of $P^s$, it is the best\ncandidate for phase estimation. In other words,\n\\[\\phi_m\\approx\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi.\\]\nWe admit that when there is a member of $P^s$ in the quarter of\n$\\phi_m$, then $w^s_m(N)$ converges. What would happen when non of\nthe members of $P^s$ has the same quarter as $\\phi_m$? This\nsituation will happen when the absolute difference between $\\angle\nw^s_m(N)$ and $\\phi_m$ is greater than $\\pi$. It means that\n$w^s_m(N)$ has not converged yet. In this case where we can not\ncount on $w^s_m(N)$, the expected value is the optimum choice for\nthe channel phase estimation, e.g. if $\\phi_m \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$\nthen $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase\n$\\phi_m$, or if $\\phi_m \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi)$ then\n$\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase $\\phi_m$.\nThe results of the above discussion are summarized in the next\nequation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nonumber \\hat{\\phi}^s_m = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{llll} \\angle\n{w^s_m(N)} & \\mbox{if}~\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)}, \\phi_m\\in R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi & \\mbox{if}~ \\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi, \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\angle{w^n_m(N)}-\\pi & \\mbox{if}~ \\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi, \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\frac{(i-1)\\pi+i\\pi}{4} & \\mbox{if}~ \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~\\angle{w^s_m(N)},\\angle\n{w^s_m(N)}\\pm\\pi\\notin R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4.\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHaving an estimation of the channel phases, the rest of the proposed\nmethod is given by estimating $\\alpha^{s}_m$ as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{tt4}\n\\alpha^{s}_m=\\mbox{sign}\\left\\{\\mbox{real}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{N}\nq^s_m(n)e^{-j\\hat{\\phi}^s_m}p_m(n)\\right\\}\\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tt5}\nq^{s}_{m}(n)=r(n)-\\sum\\limits_{m^{'}=1,m^{'}\\ne\nm}^{M}w^{s}_{m^{'}}(N)\\alpha^{(s-1)}_{m^{'}} p_{m^{'}}(n).\n\\end{equation}\nThe inputs of the first stage $\\{\\alpha^{0}_m\\}_{m=1}^M$ (needed for\ncomputing $X^1(n)$) are given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{qte5}\n\\alpha^{0}_m=\\mbox{sign}\\left\\{\\mbox{real}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{N}\nr(n)e^{-j\\hat{\\phi}^0_m}p_m(n)\\right\\}\\right\\}.\n\\end{equation}\nAssuming $\\phi_m\\in R_i$, then\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{qqpp} \\hat{\\phi}^0_m =\\frac{(i-1)\\pi+i\\pi}{4}.\n\\end{equation}\nTable \\ref{tab4} shows the structure of the modified PLMS-PPIC\nmethod.

The joint action of in-plane and out-of-plane ac electric fields generates Hall currents j ∼ Ė⊥ × E in both sum and difference frequencies, and when the two orthogonal fields have common frequency their phase difference controls the on/off, direction and magnitude of the rectified dc Hall current.\nThis novel intrinsic Hall response has a band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability, arising from layer hybridization of electrons by the twisted interlayer coupling. The effect allows a unique rectification functionality and a transport probe of chiral symmetry in bilayer systems.\nWe show sizable effects in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides and twisted bilayer graphene over broad range of twist angles. Nonlinear Hall-type response to an in-plane electric field in a two dimensional (2D) system with time reversal symmetry has attracted marked interests . Intensive studies have been devoted to uncovering new types of nonlinear Hall transport induced by quantum geometry and their applications such as terahertz rectification and magnetic information readout .\nRestricted by symmetry , the known mechanisms of nonlinear Hall response in quasi-2D nonmagnetic materials are all of extrinsic nature, sensitive to fine details of disorders , which have limited their utilization for practical applications. Moreover, having a single driving field only, the effect has not unleashed the full potential of nonlinearity for enabling controlled gate in logic operation, where separable inputs (i.e., in orthogonal directions) are desirable.\nThe latter, in the context of Hall effect, calls for control by both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. A strategy to introduce quantum geometric response to out-of-plane field in quasi-2D geometry is made possible in van der Waals (vdW) layered structures with twisted stacking . Taking homobilayer as an example, electrons have an active layer degree of freedom that is associated with an out-of-plane electric dipole , whereas interlayer quantum tunneling rotates this pseudospin about in-plane axes that are of topologically nontrivial textures in the twisted landscapes .\nSuch layer pseudospin structures can underlie novel quantum geometric properties when coupled with out-ofplane field. Recent studies have found layer circular photogalvanic effect and layer-contrasted time-reversaleven Hall effect , arising from band geometric quantities. In this work we unveil a new type of nonlinear Hall effect in time-reversal symmetric twisted bilayers, where an intrinsic Hall current emerges under the combined action of an in-plane electric field E and an out-of-plane ac field E ⊥ (t): j ∼ Ė⊥ × E [see Fig. ].\nHaving the two driving fields (inputs) and the current response (output) all orthogonal to each other, the effect is dubbed as the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect. This is also the first nonlinear Hall contribution of an intrinsic nature in nonmagnetic materials without external magnetic field, determined solely by the band structures, not relying on extrinsic factors such as disorders and relaxation times.\nThe effect arises from the interlayer hybridization of electronic states under the chiral crystal symmetry characteristic of twisted bilayers, and has a novel band geometric origin in the momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Having two driving fields of the same frequency, a dc Hall current develops, whose on/off, direction and magnitude can all be controlled by the phase difference of the two fields, which does not affect the magnitude of the double-frequency component.\nSuch a characteristic tunability renders this effect a unique approach to rectification and transport probe of chiral bilayers. As examples, we show sizable effects in small angle twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) and twisted bilayer graphene (tBG), as well as tBG of large angles where Umklapp interlayer tunneling dominates.\nGeometric origin of the effect. A bilayer system couples to in-plane and out-of-plane driving electric fields in completely different ways. The in-plane field couples to the 2D crystal momentum, leading to Berry-phase effects in the 2D momentum space . In comparison, the outof-plane field is coupled to the interlayer dipole moment p in the form of −E ⊥ p, where p = ed 0 σz with σz as the Pauli matrix in the layer index subspace and d 0 the interlayer distance.\nWhen the system has a more than twofold rotational axis in the z direction, as in tBG and tTMDs, any in-plane current driven by the out-of-plane field alone is forbidden. It also prohibits the off-diagonal components of the symmetric part of the conductivity tensor σ ab = ∂j a /∂E ||,b with respect to the in-plane input and output.\nSince the antisymmetric part of σ ab is not allowed by the Onsager reciprocity in nonmagnetic systems, all the off-diagonal components of σ ab is forbidden, irrespective of the order of out-of-plane field. On the other hand, as we will show, an in-plane Hall conductivity σ xy = −σ yx can still be driven by the product of an in-plane field and the time variation rate of an outof-plane ac field, which is a characteristic effect of chiral bilayers.\nTo account for the effect, we make use of the semiclassical theory . The velocity of an electron in a bilayer system is given by where k is the 2D crystal momentum. Here and hereafter we suppress the band index for simplicity, unless otherwise noted. The three contributions in this equation come from the band velocity, the anomalous velocities induced by the k -space Berry curvature Ω k and by the hybrid Berry curvature Ω kE ⊥ in the (k, E ⊥ ) space.\nFor the velocity at the order of interest, the k-space Berry curvature is corrected to the first order of the variation rate of out-of-plane field Ė⊥ as Here A = u k |i∂ k |u k is the unperturbed k-space Berry connection, with |u k being the cell-periodic part of the Bloch wave, whereas is its gauge invariant correction , which can be identified physically as an in-plane positional shift of an electron induced by the time evolution of the out-of-plane field.\nFor a band with index n, we have whose numerator involves the interband matrix elements of the interlayer dipole and velocity operators, and ε n is the unperturbed band energy. Meanwhile, up to the first order of in-plane field, the hybrid Berry curvature reads Here A E || is the k-space Berry connection induced by E || field , which represents an intralayer positional shift and whose detailed expression is not needed for our purpose.\nand is its first order correction induced by the in-plane field. In addition, ε = ε + δε, where δε = eE • G Ė⊥ is the field-induced electron energy . Given that A E || is the E ⊥ -space counterpart of intralayer shift A E || , and that E ⊥ is conjugate to the interlayer dipole moment, we can pictorially interpret A E || as the interlayer shift induced by in-plane field.\nIt indeed has the desired property of flipping sign under the horizontal mirror-plane reflection, hence is analogous to the so-called interlayer coordinate shift introduced in the study of layer circular photogalvanic effect , which is nothing but the E ⊥ -space counterpart of the shift vector well known in the nonlinear optical phenomenon of shift current.\nTherefore, the E ⊥ -space BCP eG/ can be understood as the interlayer BCP. This picture is further augmented by the connotation that the interlayer BCP is featured exclusively by interlayer-hybridized electronic states: According to Eq. ( ), if the state |u n is fully polarized in a specific layer around some momentum k, then G (k) is suppressed.\nWith the velocity of individual electrons, the charge current density contributed by the electron system can be obtained from where [dk] is shorthand for n d 2 k/(2π) 2 , and the distribution function is taken to be the Fermi function f 0 as we focus on the intrinsic response. The band geometric contributions to ṙ lead to a Hall current\nwhere is intrinsic to the band structure. This band geometric quantity measures the k-space curl of the interlayer BCP over the occupied states, and hence is also a characteristic of layer-hybridized electronic states. Via an integration by parts, it becomes clear that χ int is a Fermi surface property.\nSince χ int is a time-reversal even pseudoscalar, it is invariant under rotation, but flips sign under space inversion, mirror reflection and rotoreflection symmetries. As such, χ int is allowed if and only if the system possesses a chiral crystal structure, which is the very case of twisted bilayers .\nMoreover, since twisted structures with opposite twist angles are mirror images of each other, whereas the mirror reflection flips the sign of χ int , the direction of Hall current can be reversed by reversing twist direction. Hall rectification and frequency doubling. This effect can be utilized for the rectification and frequency doubling of an in-plane ac input E = E 0 cos ωt, provided that the out-of-plane field has the same frequency, namely E ⊥ = E 0 ⊥ cos (ωt + ϕ).\nThe phase difference ϕ between the two fields plays an important role in determining the Hall current, which takes the form of j = j 0 sin ϕ + j 2ω sin(2ωt + ϕ). ( Here ω is required to be below the threshold for direct interband transition in order to validate the semiclassical treatment, and σ H has the dimension of conductance and quantifies the Hall response with respect to the in-plane input.\nIn experiment, the Hall output by the crossed nonlinear dynamic Hall effect can be distinguished readily from the conventional nonlinear Hall effect driven by in-plane field alone, as they are odd and even, respectively, in the inplane field. One notes that while the double-frequency component appears for any ϕ, the rectified output is allowed only if the two crossed driving fields are not in-phase or antiphase.\nIts on/off, chirality (right or left), and magnitude are all controlled by the phase difference of the two fields. Such a unique tunability provides not only a prominent experimental hallmark of this effect, but also a controllable route to Hall rectification. In addition, reversing the direction of the out-of-plane field switches that of the Hall current, which also serves as a control knob.\nApplication to tTMDs. We now study the effect quantitatively in tTMDs, using tMoTe 2 as an example (see details of the continuum model in ). For illustrative purposes, we take ω/2π = 0.1 THz and E 0 ⊥ d 0 = 10 mV in what follows. Figures ) and (c) present the electronic band structures along with the layer composition σ z n (k) at twist angles θ = 1.2 • and θ = 2 • .\nIn both cases, the energy spectra exhibit isolated narrow bands with strong layer hybridization. At θ = 1.2 • , the conductivity shows two peaks ∼ 0.1e 2 /h at low energies associated with the first two valence bands. The third band does not host any sizable conductivity signal. At higher hole-doping levels, a remarkable conductivity peak ∼ e 2 /h appears near the gap separating the fourth and fifth bands.\nAt θ = 2 • , the conductivity shows smaller values, but the overall trends are similar: A peak ∼ O(0.01)e 2 /h appears at low energies, while larger responses ∼ O(0.1)e 2 /h can be spotted as the Fermi level decreases. One can understand the behaviors of σ H from the interlayer BCP in Eq. ( ). It favors band near-degeneracy regions in k -space made up of strongly layer hybridized electronic states.\nAs such, the conductivity is most pro- nounced when the Fermi level is located around such regions, which directly accounts for the peaks of response in Fig. that [∂ k × G] z is negligible at lower energies, and it is dominated by positive values as the doping increases, thus the conductivity rises initially.\nWhen the doping level is higher, regions with [∂ k × G] z < 0 start to contribute, thus the conductivity decreases after reaching a maximum. Application to tBG. The second example is tBG. We focus on commensurate twist angles in the large angle limit in the main text , which possess moiré-lattice assisted strong interlayer tunneling via Umklapp processes .\nThis case is appealing because the Umklapp interlayer tunneling is a manifestation of discrete translational symmetry of moiré superlattice, which is irrelevant at small twist angles and not captured by the continuum model but plays important roles in physical contexts such as higher order topological insulator and moiré excitons .\nThe Umklapp tunneling is strongest for the commensurate twist angles of θ = 21.8 • and θ = 38.2 • , whose corresponding periodic moiré superlattices have the smallest lattice constant ( √ 7 of the monolayer counterpart). Such a small moiré scale implies that the exact crystalline symmetry, which depends sensitively on fine details of rotation center, has critical influence on lowenergy response properties.\nTo capture the Umklapp tunneling, we employ the tight-binding model . Figures ) and (c) show two distinct commensurate structures of tBG at θ = 21.8 • belonging to chiral point groups D 3 and D 6 , respectively. The atomic configurations in Figs. ) are equivalent, which are constructed by twisting AA-stacked bilayer graphene around an overlapping atom site, and that in Fig. ) is obtained by rotating around a hexagonal center.\nBand structures of these two configurations are drastically different within a low-energy window of ∼ 10 meV around the κ point . Remarkably, despite large θ, we still get σ H ∼ O(0.001) e 2 /h (D 3 ) and ∼ O(0.1) e 2 /h (D 6 ), which are comparable to those at small angles (cf. Fig. in the Supplemental Material ).\nSuch sizable responses can be attributed to the strong interlayer coupling enabled by Umklapp processes . Apart from different intensities, the Hall conductivities in the two stacking configurations have distinct energy dependence: In Fig. , σ H shows a single peak centered at zero energy; In Fig. (f), it exhibits two antisymmetric peaks around zero.\nThe peaks are centered around band degeneracies, and their profiles can be understood from the distribution of [∂ k × G] z . Figure (d) illustrates the atomic structure of tBG with a twist angle slightly deviating from θ = 21.8 • , forming a supermoiré pattern. In short range, the local stacking geometries resemble the commensurate configurations at θ = 21.8 • , while the stacking registries at different locales differ by a translation.\nSimilar to the moiré landscapes in the small-angle limit, there also exist high-symmetry locales: Regions A and B enclose the D 3 structure, and region C contains the D 6 configuration. Position-dependent Hall response is therefore expected in such a supermoiré. As the intrinsic Hall signal from the D 6 configuration dominates [see Figs.\n3(e) vs (f)], the net response mimics that in Fig. . Discussion. We have uncovered the crossed nonlinear dynamical intrinsic Hall effect characteristic of layer hybridized electronic states in twisted bilayers, and elucidated its geometric origin in the k -space curl of interlayer BCP. It offers a new tool for rectification and frequency doubling in chiral vdW bilayers, and is sizable in tTMD and tBG.\nHere our focus is on the intrinsic effect, which can be evaluated quantitatively for each material and provides a benchmark for experiments. There may also be extrinsic contributions, similar to the side jump and skew scattering ones in anomalous Hall effect. They typically have distinct scaling behavior with the relaxation time τ from the intrinsic effect, hence can be distinguished from the latter in experiments .\nMoreover, they are suppressed in the clean limit ωτ 1 [(ωτ ) 2 1, more precisely] . In high-quality tBG samples, τ ∼ ps at room temperature . Much longer τ can be obtained at lower temperatures. In fact, a recent theory explaining well the resistivity of tBG predicted τ ∼ 10 −8 s at 10 K . As such, high-quality tBG under low temperatures and sub-terahertz input (ω/2π = 0.1 THz) is located in the clean limit, rendering an ideal platform for isolating the intrinsic effect.\nThis work paves a new route to driving in-plane response by out-of-plane dynamical control of layered vdW structures . The study can be generalized to other observables such as spin current and spin polarization, and the in-plane driving can be statistical forces, like temperature gradient. Such orthogonal controls rely critically on the nonconservation of layer pseudospin degree of freedom endowed by interlayer coupling, and constitute an emerging research field at the crossing of 2D vdW materials, layertronics, twistronics and nonlinear electronics.\nThis work is supported by the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong (AoE/P-701/20, HKU SRFS2122-7S05), and the Croucher Foundation.

Degeneracies at higher energies can also be identified, for example, around ±75 meV at the γ point. As the two Dirac cones from the two layers intersect around the same area, such degeneracies are usually accompanied by strong layer hybridization [see the color in the left panel of Fig. ].\nAdditionally, it is well-known that the two layers are strongly coupled when θ is around the magic angle (∼ 1.08 • ), rendering narrow bandwidths for the central bands. As discussed in the main text, coexistence of strong interlayer hybridization and small energy separations is expected to contribute sharp conductivity peaks near band degeneracies, as shown in Fig. .\nIn this case, the conductivity peak near the Dirac point can reach ∼ 0.1e 2 /h, while the responses around ±0.08 eV are smaller at ∼ 0.01e 2 /h. The above features are maintained when θ is enlarged, as illustrated in Figs. ) and (c) using θ = 2.65 • and θ = 6.01 • . Since interlayer coupling becomes weaker and the bands are more separated at low energies when θ increases, intensity of the conductivity drops significantly.\nWe stress that G is not defined at degenerate points, and interband transitions may occur when energy separation satisfies |ε n − ε m | ∼ ω, the effects of which are not included in the current formulations.

As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County.\n\nPeketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.\n\nIn 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years.\n\nIn April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since.\n\nAs early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.  In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood.\n\nIn 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway extended its main line from Herington to Pratt.  This main line connected Herington, Ramona, Tampa, Durham, Waldeck, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Groveland, Inman, Medora, Hutchinson, Whiteside, Partridge, Arlington,  Langdon, Turon, Preston, Natrona, Pratt.  In 1888, this main line was extended to Liberal.  Later, this line was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and Santa Rosa, New Mexico, where it made a connection with the Southern Pacific from El Paso, Texas.

{"input": "Where is McPherson County located?", "context": "McPherson County (standard abbreviation: MP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas.  As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County.\n\nPeketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.\n\nIn 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years.\n\nIn April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since.\n\nAs early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.  In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood.\n\nIn 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway extended its main line from Herington to Pratt.  This main line connected Herington, Ramona, Tampa, Durham, Waldeck, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Groveland, Inman, Medora, Hutchinson, Whiteside, Partridge, Arlington,  Langdon, Turon, Preston, Natrona, Pratt.  In 1888, this main line was extended to Liberal.  Later, this line was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and Santa Rosa, New Mexico, where it made a connection with the Southern Pacific from El Paso, Texas.  The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was absorbed by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. This line is also called the \"Golden State Route\".\n\n20th century\nThe National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Windom, Conway, McPherson.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.3%) is water.\n\nAdjacent counties\n Saline County (north)\n Dickinson County (northeast)\n Marion County (east)\n Harvey County (southeast)\n Reno County (southwest)\n Rice County (west)\n Ellsworth County (northwest)\n\nMajor highways\n  Interstate 135\n  U.S. Route 56\n  U.S. Route 81\n  K-4\n  K-61\n  K-153\n\nDemographics\n\nThe McPherson Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of McPherson County.\n\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 29,554 people, 11,205 households, and 7,966 families residing in the county.  The population density was 33 people per square mile (13/km2).  There were 11,830 housing units at an average density of 13 per square mile (5/km2).

{"input": "Who was Brooksley Elizabeth's first husband?", "context": "Brooksley Elizabeth Born (born August 27, 1940) is an American attorney and former public official who, from August 26, 1996, to June 1, 1999, was chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the federal agency which oversees the U.S. futures and commodity options markets. During her tenure on the CFTC, Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of off-exchange markets for derivatives, in addition to its role with respect to exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were ignored or dismissed, and her calls for reform resisted by other regulators.<ref name=\"nytimes\">Goodman, Peter S. The Reckoning - Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy, The New York Times, October 9, 2008.</ref> Born resigned as chairperson on June 1, 1999, shortly after Congress passed legislation prohibiting her agency from regulating derivatives.\n\nIn 2009, Born received the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award, along with Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco, California) at the age of 16. She then attended Stanford University, where she majored in English and was graduated with the class of 1961.  She initially wanted to become a doctor, but a guidance counsellor at Stanford advised her against medicine, so she majored in English literature instead.\n\nShe then attended Stanford Law School, one of only seven women in her class.  She was the first female student ever to be named president of the Stanford Law Review. She received the \"Outstanding Senior\" award and graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1964.\n\nLegal career\nImmediately after law school Born was selected as a law clerk to judge Henry Edgerton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It was during this time that she met her first husband, Jacob C. Landau, who was a journalist covering the Federal courts at the time. Following her clerkship, she became an associate at the Washington, D.C.-based international law firm of Arnold & Porter. Born was attracted to Arnold & Porter because it was one of the few major law firms to have a woman partner at that time, Carolyn Agger, who was the head of the tax practice. Born took a two-year leave of absence from Arnold & Porter to accompany her first husband to Boston, where he had received a fellowship. During that time she worked as a research assistant to law professor Alan Dershowitz.\n\nBorn's early career at Arnold & Porter focused on international trade law, in which she represented a number of Swiss industries and the government of Switzerland. She developed a practice representing clients in numerous complex litigation and arbitration cases involving financial market transactions. Among her high-profile cases was the matter of the Hunt Brothers attempt to corner the market in silver in the 1970s. She made partner at Arnold & Porter, after moving to a three-day schedule to help raise her second child, and eventually rose to be the head of the firm's derivatives practice.\n\nBorn was among the first female attorneys to systematically address inequities regarding how the laws treated women. Born and another female lawyer, Marna Tucker, taught what is considered to have been the first \"Women and the Law\" course at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law. The class exclusively concerned prejudicial treatment of women under the laws of the United States, past and present.  Born and Tucker were surprised to discover that there was no textbook on the issue at the time.  Born is also one of the co-founders of the National Women's Law Center. Born also helped rewrite the American Bar Association rules to make it possible for more women and minorities to sit on federal bench.\n\nDuring her long legal career, and into her retirement, Born did much pro bono and other types of volunteer work. She was active in the American Bar Association, the largest professional organization of lawyers in the United States.  Initially Born was named a member of the governing council of the ABA's Individual Rights Section, eventually becoming chairperson.  Born and Tucker founded the ABA Women's Caucus, the first organization of female lawyers in the ABA.  She held several other senior positions in the ABA, including being named the first woman member of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, Born provided testimony and opinion on persons nominated for federal judgeships. In 1980 she was named chair of the committee.  As chair of the committee, Born was invited to address the U.S. Congress regarding the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1993, Born's name was floated as a possible candidate for Attorney General of the United States, but Janet Reno was nominated.\n\nIn July 2009, Nancy Pelosi appointed Brooksley Born as a commissioner to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).\n\nBorn and the OTC derivatives market\nBorn was appointed to the CFTC on April 15, 1994, by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System,  the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any.  CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC's concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivative instruments could create a \"legal uncertainty\" regarding such financial instruments,  hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would \"stifle financial innovation\" and encourage financial capital to transfer its  transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies,  insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.\n\nIn 1998, a trillion-dollar hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) was near collapse.  Using mathematical models to calculate debt risk, LTCM used derivatives to leverage $5 billion into more than $1 trillion, doing business with fifteen of Wall Street's largest financial institutions.  The derivative transactions were not regulated, nor were investors able to evaluate LTCM's exposures.  Born stated, \"I thought that LTCM was exactly what I had been worried about\".  In the last weekend of September 1998, the President's working group was told that the entire American economy hung in the balance.  After intervention by the Federal Reserve, the crisis was averted.  In congressional hearings into the crisis, Greenspan acknowledged that language had been introduced into an agriculture bill that would prevent CFTC from regulating the derivatives which were at the center of the crisis that threatened the US economy.  U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) asked \"How many more failures do you think we'd have to have before some regulation in this area might be appropriate?\"  In response, Greenspan brushed aside the substance of Born's warnings with the simple assertion that \"the degree of supervision of regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market is quite adequate to maintain a degree of stability in the system\". Born's warning was that there wasn't any regulation of them.  Born's chief of staff, Michael Greenberger summed up Greenspan's position this way: \"Greenspan didn't believe that fraud was something that needed to be enforced, and he assumed she probably did. And of course, she did.\"  Under heavy pressure from the financial lobby, legislation prohibiting regulation of derivatives by Born's agency was passed by the Congress.  Born resigned on June 1, 1999.\n\nThe derivatives market continued to grow yearly throughout both terms of George W. Bush's administration. On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers forced a broad recognition of a financial crisis in both the US and world capital markets.  As Lehman Brothers' failure temporarily reduced financial capital's confidence, a number of newspaper articles and television programs suggested that the failure's possible causes included the conflict between the CFTC and the other regulators.Faiola, Anthony, Nakashima, Ellen and Drew, Jill. The Crash: Risk and Regulation - What Went Wrong, The Washington Post, October 15, 2008.\n\nBorn declined to publicly comment on the unfolding 2008 crisis until March 2009, when she said: \"The market grew so enormously, with so little oversight and regulation, that it made the financial crisis much deeper and more pervasive than it otherwise would have been.\" She also lamented the influence of Wall Street lobbyists on the process and the refusal of regulators to discuss even modest reforms.\n\nAn October 2009 Frontline documentary titled \"The Warning\"  described Born's thwarted efforts to regulate and bring transparency to the derivatives market, and the continuing opposition thereto. The program concluded with an excerpted interview with Born sounding another warning: \"I think we will have continuing danger from these markets and that we will have repeats of the financial crisis -- may differ in details but there will be significant financial downturns and disasters attributed to this regulatory gap, over and over, until we learn from experience.\"\n\nIn 2009 Born, along with Sheila Bair of the FDIC, was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award in recognition of the \"political courage she demonstrated in sounding early warnings about conditions that contributed\" to the 2007-08 financial crisis.  According to Caroline Kennedy, \"Brooksley Born recognized that the financial security of all Americans was being put at risk by the greed, negligence and opposition of  powerful and well connected interests.... The catastrophic financial events of recent months have  proved them [Born and Sheila Bair] right.\"  One member of the President's working group had a change of heart about Brooksley Born.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt stated \"I've come to know her as one of the most capable, dedicated, intelligent and committed public servants that I have ever come to know\", adding that \"I could have done much better. I could have made a difference\" in response to her warnings.\n\nIn 2010, a documentary film Inside Job further alleged that derivatives regulation was ineffective from the Clinton administration on. Along with fellow whistleblower, former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan, who was also scorned by the economic establishment, Brooksley Born was cited as one of the authorities arguing that financial derivatives increase economic risk.\n\n Personal life \nBorn is married to Alexander E. Bennett (also retired from Arnold & Porter).  She has five adult children - two from a previous marriage to Jacob Landau and three stepchildren. Notably, Born was named a partner at Arnold & Porter while working part-time so she could raise her two young children.

This paper outlines our approach to the VarDial 2023 DSL-TL shared task. Here we have to identify three or two dialects from three languages each which results in a 9-way classification for Track-1 and 6-way classification for Track-2 respectively.\nOur proposed approach consists of a two-stage system and outperforms other participants' systems and previous works in this domain. We achieve a score of 58.54% for Track-1 and 85.61% for Track-2. Our codebase is available publicly 1 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage has been the primary mode of communication for humans since the pre-historic ages. Studies have explored the evolution of language and outlined mathematical models that govern the intricacies of natural language . Inevitably, as humans established civilization in various parts of the world, this language was modified by, and for the group of people occupied by that particular geographical region.\nThis gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.\nThis shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks.\nMoreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task.We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language.\nWe converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.\n\nRelated Work\n\nThe present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.\n\nLarge Language Models\n\nThe success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model. In recent years, many other architectures like RoBERTa and ELECTRA have further pushed the state-of-the-art in this domain. Moreover, autoregressive models like GPT and GPT-2 have also shown their prowess.\nMultilingual versions of RoBERTA, namely XLM-RoBERTa are also available. Lastly, language specific models like Spanish BERT (la Rosa y Eduardo G. Ponferrada y Manu Romero y Paulo Villegas y Pablo González de Prado Salas y María Grandury, 2022) and Portuguese BERT are available as well. Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages.\n\nLanguage Identification Models\n\nMany multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification .\nRecent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%.\n\nDialect Classification\n\nDialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise .\nDialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option. In our work, although we take inspiration from the previous works, we propose a novel system that surpasses the performance of the previous systems by a large margin.\n\nData\n\nThe dataset  We observed that the class PT-BR had the most number of samples (2,724) and the class EN had the least number of samples (349), and thus the imbalance ratio was almost 1:8. We have illustrated the data distribution in Figure . We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods.\nHowever, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance.\n\nSystem Description\n\nThis was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT).\nThe LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification.\nFor dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa.\nAll models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results\n\nExperiments using Large Language Models\n\nFor the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned.\nFirst, we experimented with different models for Track-1. All the models were trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-6, weight decay 1e-6 and a batch size of 8. We used XLM-RoBERTa as the baseline for all 3 languages. The best performing models for the English language were RoBERTa and BERT whereas GPT-2 was the worst performing.\nSimilarly the language specific versions of RoBERTa and BERT performed well for the Spanish and Portuguese respectively. Overall the worst performing model was GPT-2 across all 3 languages. The validation F1 scores are present in Table . The two best-performing models for every language were chosen for Track-2.\nThe same procedure as specified above was used and the F1 scores are present in Table . The train and validation F1 scores for 2-class classification are higher for all models as compared to the F1 score of the same models for 3-class classification. This was mainly due to the poor representation and accuracy of classification of the third class.\nWe observed symptoms of overfitting in all models after 12-15 epochs and the best validation F1 score was obtained in the range of 4-8 epochs.\n\nLID experiments\n\nThe pipeline for dialect identification is divided into two parts as the sentences in the dataset belong to different languages. The stages are described in Section 4. The XLM-RoBERTa we have used for language classification has a test accuracy of 99.6% meaning it correctly classifies all input sentences and hence, can be considered as a perfect classifier.\nFor the final pipeline we experimented using the two best performing models for each language in Track-1 and Track-2. For both the tracks we experimented with all 8 (2 3 ) possible combinations of models and calculated the validation F1 score for the combined validation dataset which had sentences belonging to all languages.\nThe validation scores for Track-1 and Track-2 are shown in Table and Table respectively. For both the tracks, the three pipelines with the best validation F1 scores were chosen for submission.\n\nUsing 3-way classifier as a 2-way classifier\n\nIn Track-1, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 9 classes, and in Track-2, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 6 classes. These 6 classes are a proper subset of the 9 classes from Track-1. Thus, an intuitive baseline for Track-2 is to use the model finetuned for Track-1, whilst considering only the relevant classes for the latter task.\nThe classes EN , ES and P T , i.e. the classes without any national dialect associated with them are not included in Track-2 as compared to Track-1. Thus, we calculate the predictions for the Track-2 validation dataset using the models for Track-1 and exclude the metrics for Track-1 specific classes to get the metrics for this \"adapted\" 2-way classification.\nWe show the results of this experiment in Table and observe that, as expected, the adapted 2-way classification performs worse compared to the explicitly finetuned variant.\n\nResults for Track-1 and Track-2\n\nWe now present our experiments and their performance for both tracks. Our experiments for Track-1 are described in Table and our experiments for Track-2 are described in Table . The participants were allowed three submissions for evaluation on the test set, so we submitted predictions using the three systems which performed the best on the validation set.\nAs mentioned in Section 5.2, we performed 2 3 , i.e. a total of 8 experiments using the two best models for each language. We observed that RoBERTa base on English, Spanish BERT base on Spanish and Portuguese BERT base performed the best on the testing set for Track-1. The same combination, with RoBERTa base for English, worked best for Track-2.\nAll of our submissions were the top submissions for each track, which surpassed the next best competitors by a margin of 4.5% and 5.6% for Track-1 and Track-2 respectively.\n\nAblation of best submissions\n\nWe hereby make some observations of our submissions and other experiments. To assist this, we plot the confusion matrices of our best submissions for Track-1 and Track-2 in Figures respectively. Note that these confusion matrices have their rows (i.e. true labels axes) normalized according to the number of samples in the class.\nHere are observations from our experiments: 1. BERT-based models outperform other models across all languages: We observe that BERT-based models outperform ELECTRA-based and GPT-2-based models, as shown in Table . We speculate this is because of the inherent architecture of BERT, which combines semantic learning with knowledge retention.\nThis combination of traits is particularly useful for this task. 2. Common labels perform the worst across all languages: We observe that the common labels EN , ES and P T perform the worst, both in the individual as well as the two-stage setup. We hypothesize this is because of the absence of dialect specific words, or words that are specific to the geographical origin of the national dialect (for example, \"Yankees\" for EN-US and \"Oxford\" for EN-GB).\n3. English models work better than models of other languages: It can be noted from Figures 4 and 3 that the English models have the best performance across all classes. This can be attributed to two reasons: absence of national dialect specific words and lesser pretraining data in the case of Portuguese.\n4. British English is most correctly classified class: We can observe that the Spanish or Portuguese models make equal number of mistakes in the case of either national dialect, in the case of Track-2 (see Figure ). However, in the case of English, the label EN − GB is correctly classified for more than 95% of the cases.\nWe speculate this is because British English involves slightly distinctive grammar and semantics, which help the model separate it from other classes. 5. The proposed 2-step method is scalable for multiple language dialect classification: We can strongly assert that the novel 2-step deep learning method for multilingual dialect classification is a scalable method for the task due to two specific reasons: firstly, the multilingual models (like XLM-RoBERTa) might not have the vocabulary as well as the learning capabilities to learn the minute differences between individual dialects.\nSecondly, this system can be quickly expanded for a new language by simply adding a language specific dialect classifier, provided the language identification model supports that particular language.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we propose a two-stage classification pipeline for dialect identification for multilingual corpora. We conduct thorough ablations on this setup and provide valuable insights. We foresee multiple future directions for this work. The first is to expand this work to many languages and dialects.\nSecondly, it is a worthwhile research direction to distill this multi-model setup into a single model with multiple prediction heads. The obvious limitation of this system is the excessive memory consumption due to the usage of language specific models. For low resource languages this system is difficult to train and scale.\nWe hope that these problems will be addressed by researchers in future works.", "answers": ["BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, GPT-2, and XLM-RoBERTa."], "length": 2397, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "635ad5e3696e0d297f3ea8909d42975a5c1eb49a7f4a8466"}
{"input": "Where is the club's headquarters located?", "context": "Football Club Urartu (, translated Futbolayin Akumb Urartu), commonly known as Urartu, is an Armenian professional football team based in the capital Yerevan that currently plays in the Armenian Premier League. The club won the Armenian Cup three times, in 1992, 2007 and 2016. In 2013–2014, they won the Armenian Premier League for the first time in their history.\n\nIn early 2016, the Russia-based Armenian businessman Dzhevan Cheloyants became a co-owner of the club after purchasing the major part of the club shares. The club was known as FC Banants until 1 August 2019, when it was officially renamed FC Urartu.\n\nHistory\n\nKotayk\nUrartu FC were founded as FC Banants by Sarkis Israelyan on 21 January 1992 in the village of Kotayk, representing the Kotayk Province. He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.\n\nYerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan. After the merger, Banants took a more serious approach and have finished highly in the league table ever since. The club managed to lift the Armenian Cup in 2007.\nExperience is making way for youth for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. The departures of most of the experienced players have left the club's future to the youth.

It was officially opened in 2008 with a capacity of 3,600 seats. Further developments were implemented later in 2011, when the playing pitch was modernized and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 4,860 seats (2,760 at the northern stand, 1,500 at the southern stand and 600 at the western stand).\n\nTraining centre/academy\nBanants Training Centre is the club's academy base located in the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan. In addition to the main stadium, the centre houses 3 full-size training pitches, mini football pitches as well as an indoor facility. The current technical director of the academy is the former Russian footballer Ilshat Faizulin.\n\nFans\nThe most active group of fans is the South West Ultras fan club, mainly composed of residents from several neighbourhoods within the Malatia-Sebastia District of Yerevan, since the club is a de facto representer of the district. Members of the fan club benefit from events organized by the club and many facilities of the Banants training centre, such as the mini football pitch, the club store and other entertainments.\n\nAchievements\n Armenian Premier League\n Winner (1): 2013–14.\n Runner-up (5): 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2018.\n\n Armenian Cup\n Winner (3): 1992, 2007, 2016.\n Runner-up (6): 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2021–22\n\n Armenian Supercup\n Winner (1): 2014.\n Runner-up (5): 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2016.\n\nCurrent squad\n\nOut on loan\n\nPersonnel\n\nTechnical staff\n\nManagement\n\nUrartu-2\n\nFC Banants' reserve squad play as FC Banants-2 in the Armenian First League.

He named the club after his native village of Banants (currently known as Bayan). Between 1992 and 1995, the club was commonly referred to as Banants Kotayk. During the 1992 season, the club won the first Armenian Cup. At the end of the 1995 transitional season, Banants suffered a financial crisis. The club owners decided that it was better to merge the club with FC Kotayk of Abovyan, rather than disband it. In 2001, Banants demerged from FC Kotayk, and was moved from Abovyan to the capital Yerevan.\n\nYerevan\n\nFC Banants was relocated to Yerevan in 2001. At the beginning of 2003, Banants merged with FC Spartak Yerevan, but was able to limit the name of the new merger to FC Banants. Spartak became Banants's youth academy and later changed the name to Banants-2. Because of the merger, Banants acquired many players from Spartak Yerevan, including Samvel Melkonyan.

{"input": "What was the population of McPherson County according to the 2020 census?", "context": "McPherson County (standard abbreviation: MP) is a county located in the U.S. state of Kansas.  As of the 2020 census, the county population was 30,223. The largest city and county seat is McPherson. The county is named for Civil War General James B. McPherson.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.\n\nIn 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1848, after the Mexican–American War, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Spain brought into the United States all or part of land for ten future states, including southwest Kansas. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.\n\n19th century\n\nFrom the 1820s to 1870s, the Santa Fe Trail passed through, what is now McPherson County. The trail entered the county, east of Canton, then south of Galva, then north of Inman, and west towards Lyons. In 1855, Charles O. Fuller established a ranch adjacent to the Running Turkey Creek Crossing about two miles south and one mile east of Galva. Fuller's Ranch provided accommodations for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail and was probably the first white settlement in McPherson County.\n\nPeketon County was established in 1860, by the passage of a bill by S. N. Wood:  An act to establish Peketon County. Section 1. - That all that territory west of the sixth principal meridian and south of Township 16, in Kansas Territory, be and the same is hereby erected into a county, to be known by the name of Peketon County. On February 17, 1865, Peketon County was abolished, and McPherson County was made a part of Marion County, which extended from the west line of Chase County to the present western boundary of Kansas.\n\nIn 1868, Solomon Stephens and L. N. Holmberg were appointed Justices of the Peace—the first officers in what is now McPherson County. The next year (1869) occurred the first election for the township, now the county of McPherson. McPherson was regularly organized as a county in the spring of 1870, a mass meeting being held at Sweadal. Sweadal, the county seat thus selected, was located about one mile and a half southwest of the present site of Lindsborg. In September, however, the County Commissioners resolved to meet at the latter place, McPherson which had already been located some two years.\n\nIn April, 1873, a petition was filed for the county seat re-location. It was signed by 483 voters, and a special election was accordingly ordered for June 10. Upon that day, McPherson received 605 votes, New Gottland 325, King City 3 and Lindsborg 1; McPherson's majority over all, 276. In May the McPherson Town Company had offered, as an inducement for the location of the county seat at this point, the free use of rooms for ten years, and the donation of two squares of land on the town site. The offer was accepted the next month, the County Commissioners selecting blocks 56 and 65. Thus the county seat was established at McPherson and has remained since.\n\nAs early as 1875, city leaders of Marion held a meeting to consider a branch railroad from Florence. In 1878, Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and parties from Marion County and McPherson County chartered the Marion and McPherson Railway Company.  In 1879, a branch line was built from Florence to McPherson, in 1880 it was extended to Lyons, in 1881 it was extended to Ellinwood. The line was leased and operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The line from Florence to Marion, was abandoned in 1968. In 1992, the line from Marion to McPherson was sold to Central Kansas Railway. In 1993, after heavy flood damage, the line from Marion to McPherson was abandoned. The original branch line connected Florence, Marion, Canada, Hillsboro, Lehigh, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Conway, Windom, Little River, Mitchell, Lyons, Chase, then connected with the original AT&SF main line at Ellinwood.\n\nIn 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway extended its main line from Herington to Pratt.  This main line connected Herington, Ramona, Tampa, Durham, Waldeck, Canton, Galva, McPherson, Groveland, Inman, Medora, Hutchinson, Whiteside, Partridge, Arlington,  Langdon, Turon, Preston, Natrona, Pratt.  In 1888, this main line was extended to Liberal.  Later, this line was extended to Tucumcari, New Mexico and Santa Rosa, New Mexico, where it made a connection with the Southern Pacific from El Paso, Texas.  The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was absorbed by the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. This line is also called the \"Golden State Route\".\n\n20th century\nThe National Old Trails Road, also known as the Ocean-to-Ocean Highway, was established in 1912, and was routed through Windom, Conway, McPherson.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.3%) is water.\n\nAdjacent counties\n Saline County (north)\n Dickinson County (northeast)\n Marion County (east)\n Harvey County (southeast)\n Reno County (southwest)\n Rice County (west)\n Ellsworth County (northwest)\n\nMajor highways\n  Interstate 135\n  U.S. Route 56\n  U.S. Route 81\n  K-4\n  K-61\n  K-153\n\nDemographics\n\nThe McPherson Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of McPherson County.\n\n2000 census\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 29,554 people, 11,205 households, and 7,966 families residing in the county.

{"input": "How many brother does Njoroge have?", "context": "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.\n\nPlot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.\n\nOne day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.\n\nMwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.\n\nFor a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.\n\nJacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.\n\nOne day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.\n\nSeveral months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.\n\nNjoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.\n\nCharacters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.\n Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.\n Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.\n Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).\n Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.\n Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.\n Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.\n Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.\n\nThemes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.\n\nThe novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.", "answers": ["Four."], "length": 1414, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "69e69439e349a539ca4cff96ae35aa8499ca61886801d488"}
{"input": "When did Goodwin become a Naval aviator?", "context": "Hugh Hilton Goodwin (December 21, 1900 – February 25, 1980) was a decorated officer in the United States Navy with the rank of Vice Admiral. A veteran of both World Wars, he commanded escort carrier  during the Mariana Islands campaign. Goodwin then served consecutively as Chief of Staff, Carrier Strike Group 6 and as Air Officer, Philippine Sea Frontier and participated in the Philippines campaign in the later part of the War.\n\nFollowing the War, he remained in the Navy and rose to the flag rank and held several important commands including Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service, Commander, Carrier Division Two and Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nHugh H. Goodwin was born on December 21, 1900, in Monroe, Louisiana and attended Monroe High School there (now Neville High School). Following the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, Goodwin left the school without receiving the diploma in order to see some combat and enlisted the United States Navy on May 7, 1917. He completed basic training and was assigned to the battleship . Goodwin participated in the training of armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war and in November 1917, he sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea.\n\nAlthough he did not complete the last year of high school, Goodwin was able to earn an appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland in June 1918. While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.\n\nGoodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.\n\nHe then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.\n\nGoodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.\n\nIn June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.\n\nHe was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.\n\nGoodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .\n\nWhen his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.\n\nBy the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.\n\nDuring the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.\n\nThe air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.\n\nGoodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nHe was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.\n\nGoodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat \"V\". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nPostwar service\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.\n\nGoodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.\n\nRevolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.\n\nGoodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.\n\nLater service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nWhile in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.\n\nGoodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.\n\nOn December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.\n\nRetirement\n\nGoodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nVice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.\n\nDecorations\n\nHere is the ribbon bar of Vice admiral Hugh H.

We achieve a score of 58.54% for Track-1 and 85.61% for Track-2. Our codebase is available publicly 1 .\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage has been the primary mode of communication for humans since the pre-historic ages. Studies have explored the evolution of language and outlined mathematical models that govern the intricacies of natural language . Inevitably, as humans established civilization in various parts of the world, this language was modified by, and for the group of people occupied by that particular geographical region.\nThis gave rise to multiple national dialects of the same language. The VarDial workshop (colocated with EACL 2023) explores various dialects and variations of the same language. We participated in the Discriminating Between Similar Languages -True Labels (DSL-TL) shared task. In this task, the participants were provided with data from three languages, with each language having three varieties.\nThis shared task consisted of two tracks -Track-1 featuring nine-way classification and Track-2 featuring six-way classification. The second track included two particular national dialects of each language (eg. American English and British English), and the first track had one general  We ranked 1 st in both of the tracks.\nMoreover, we beat the next best submission by a margin of 4.5% in the first task and 5.6% in the second task.We were the only team to surpass the organizer baseline scores. We present our winning solution in this paper. We used an end-to-end deep learning pipeline which consisted of a language identification model and three language-specific models, one for each language.\nWe converged upon the best combination by doing an elaborate analysis of various models available. Furthermore, in this work we also analyze the performance of the pipeline as a whole and also provide an ablation study. Lastly, we provide some future directions in this area of research.\n\nRelated Work\n\nThe present literature encompasses various aspects of dialect identification. We study this from three perspectives: large language models, language identification and dialect classification problems.\n\nLarge Language Models\n\nThe success of transformers and BERT based models was inevitable since the initial boom of the transformer  2017) model. In recent years, many other architectures like RoBERTa and ELECTRA have further pushed the state-of-the-art in this domain. Moreover, autoregressive models like GPT and GPT-2 have also shown their prowess.\nMultilingual versions of RoBERTA, namely XLM-RoBERTa are also available. Lastly, language specific models like Spanish BERT (la Rosa y Eduardo G. Ponferrada y Manu Romero y Paulo Villegas y Pablo González de Prado Salas y María Grandury, 2022) and Portuguese BERT are available as well. Our winning solution makes use of these large language models trained on specific languages.\n\nLanguage Identification Models\n\nMany multilingual language identification models have been developed in order to classify the language of the input sentence beforehand. Even though the initial works used n-gram models and generative mixture models or even conditional random fields and other classical machine learning methods like naive bayes , modern methods have shifted to the use of deep learning for language identification .\nRecent works have mainly focused on deep learning based language identification, where handling codemixed data is a big challenge in the domain. For our experiments, we use a version of XLM-RoBERTa finetuned on a language identification dataset 2 . This model has near-perfect test accuracy of 99.6%.\n\nDialect Classification\n\nDialect classification has been previously solved using statistical methods like Gaussian Mixture Models and Frame Selection Decoding or Support Vector Machines (SVM) . It has been explored relatively sparsely, mostly in the case for local languages . Deep learning approaches have been explored in previous editions of the VarDial workshop shared tasks and otherwise .\nDialect classification was also explored previously as a part of other shared tasks . We want to stress that given the multilingual nature of the dataset, using the present methods directly was not an option. In our work, although we take inspiration from the previous works, we propose a novel system that surpasses the performance of the previous systems by a large margin.\n\nData\n\nThe dataset  We observed that the class PT-BR had the most number of samples (2,724) and the class EN had the least number of samples (349), and thus the imbalance ratio was almost 1:8. We have illustrated the data distribution in Figure . We tried to mitigate this imbalance using over-sampling and weighted sampling methods.\nHowever, the improved data sampling method did not affect the performance.\n\nSystem Description\n\nThis was a problem of multi-class classification having 9 classes for Track-1 and 6 classes for Track-2. The samples were belonging to 3 languages having 3 varieties each, so the classification pipeline was made in 2 stages. The Language Identification (LID) model which is the first stage classifies the sentence into 3 languages: English (EN), Spanish (ES) and Portuguese (PT).\nThe LID is a pretrained XLM-RoBERTa that is fine-tuned for the task of language identification. It is able to classify the input sentence into 20 languages. We classify and separate the samples according to their language. The samples corresponding to the specific languages are then fed into the language specific models for dialect identification.\nFor dialect identification we have used models like BERT and RoBERTa with a linear layer connected to the pooler output of the models. Then fine-tuning is done on the models for dialect identification   using the samples corresponding to the specific languages. For the task of dialect identification we experimented with several pretrained models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, GPT-2 and RoBERTa.\nAll models were fine-tuned for 20 epochs with a learning rate of 1e-6 and weight decay 1e-6 with a batch size of 8. The best performing model checkpoint was chosen according to the epoch-wise validation macro-F1 score. 5 Experiments and Results\n\nExperiments using Large Language Models\n\nFor the task of Dialect Identification we have tried various language specific models like XLM-RoBERTa, BERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa and GPT- 2. The base variant of all these models were used and all the models were used through the Hugging-Face library. The pooler output of these models was passed through a linear layer and the models were fine-tuned.\nFirst, we experimented with different models for Track-1. All the models were trained for 20 epochs with learning rate 1e-6, weight decay 1e-6 and a batch size of 8. We used XLM-RoBERTa as the baseline for all 3 languages. The best performing models for the English language were RoBERTa and BERT whereas GPT-2 was the worst performing.\nSimilarly the language specific versions of RoBERTa and BERT performed well for the Spanish and Portuguese respectively. Overall the worst performing model was GPT-2 across all 3 languages. The validation F1 scores are present in Table . The two best-performing models for every language were chosen for Track-2.\nThe same procedure as specified above was used and the F1 scores are present in Table . The train and validation F1 scores for 2-class classification are higher for all models as compared to the F1 score of the same models for 3-class classification. This was mainly due to the poor representation and accuracy of classification of the third class.\nWe observed symptoms of overfitting in all models after 12-15 epochs and the best validation F1 score was obtained in the range of 4-8 epochs.\n\nLID experiments\n\nThe pipeline for dialect identification is divided into two parts as the sentences in the dataset belong to different languages. The stages are described in Section 4. The XLM-RoBERTa we have used for language classification has a test accuracy of 99.6% meaning it correctly classifies all input sentences and hence, can be considered as a perfect classifier.\nFor the final pipeline we experimented using the two best performing models for each language in Track-1 and Track-2. For both the tracks we experimented with all 8 (2 3 ) possible combinations of models and calculated the validation F1 score for the combined validation dataset which had sentences belonging to all languages.\nThe validation scores for Track-1 and Track-2 are shown in Table and Table respectively. For both the tracks, the three pipelines with the best validation F1 scores were chosen for submission.\n\nUsing 3-way classifier as a 2-way classifier\n\nIn Track-1, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 9 classes, and in Track-2, participants are expected to train a classifier which classifies amongst 6 classes. These 6 classes are a proper subset of the 9 classes from Track-1. Thus, an intuitive baseline for Track-2 is to use the model finetuned for Track-1, whilst considering only the relevant classes for the latter task.\nThe classes EN , ES and P T , i.e. the classes without any national dialect associated with them are not included in Track-2 as compared to Track-1. Thus, we calculate the predictions for the Track-2 validation dataset using the models for Track-1 and exclude the metrics for Track-1 specific classes to get the metrics for this \"adapted\" 2-way classification.\nWe show the results of this experiment in Table and observe that, as expected, the adapted 2-way classification performs worse compared to the explicitly finetuned variant.\n\nResults for Track-1 and Track-2\n\nWe now present our experiments and their performance for both tracks. Our experiments for Track-1 are described in Table and our experiments for Track-2 are described in Table . The participants were allowed three submissions for evaluation on the test set, so we submitted predictions using the three systems which performed the best on the validation set.\nAs mentioned in Section 5.2, we performed 2 3 , i.e. a total of 8 experiments using the two best models for each language. We observed that RoBERTa base on English, Spanish BERT base on Spanish and Portuguese BERT base performed the best on the testing set for Track-1. The same combination, with RoBERTa base for English, worked best for Track-2.\nAll of our submissions were the top submissions for each track, which surpassed the next best competitors by a margin of 4.5% and 5.6% for Track-1 and Track-2 respectively.\n\nAblation of best submissions\n\nWe hereby make some observations of our submissions and other experiments. To assist this, we plot the confusion matrices of our best submissions for Track-1 and Track-2 in Figures respectively. Note that these confusion matrices have their rows (i.e. true labels axes) normalized according to the number of samples in the class.\nHere are observations from our experiments: 1. BERT-based models outperform other models across all languages: We observe that BERT-based models outperform ELECTRA-based and GPT-2-based models, as shown in Table . We speculate this is because of the inherent architecture of BERT, which combines semantic learning with knowledge retention.\nThis combination of traits is particularly useful for this task. 2. Common labels perform the worst across all languages: We observe that the common labels EN , ES and P T perform the worst, both in the individual as well as the two-stage setup. We hypothesize this is because of the absence of dialect specific words, or words that are specific to the geographical origin of the national dialect (for example, \"Yankees\" for EN-US and \"Oxford\" for EN-GB).\n3. English models work better than models of other languages: It can be noted from Figures 4 and 3 that the English models have the best performance across all classes. This can be attributed to two reasons: absence of national dialect specific words and lesser pretraining data in the case of Portuguese.\n4. British English is most correctly classified class: We can observe that the Spanish or Portuguese models make equal number of mistakes in the case of either national dialect, in the case of Track-2 (see Figure ). However, in the case of English, the label EN − GB is correctly classified for more than 95% of the cases.\nWe speculate this is because British English involves slightly distinctive grammar and semantics, which help the model separate it from other classes. 5. The proposed 2-step method is scalable for multiple language dialect classification: We can strongly assert that the novel 2-step deep learning method for multilingual dialect classification is a scalable method for the task due to two specific reasons: firstly, the multilingual models (like XLM-RoBERTa) might not have the vocabulary as well as the learning capabilities to learn the minute differences between individual dialects.\nSecondly, this system can be quickly expanded for a new language by simply adding a language specific dialect classifier, provided the language identification model supports that particular language.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we propose a two-stage classification pipeline for dialect identification for multilingual corpora. We conduct thorough ablations on this setup and provide valuable insights. We foresee multiple future directions for this work. The first is to expand this work to many languages and dialects.\nSecondly, it is a worthwhile research direction to distill this multi-model setup into a single model with multiple prediction heads. The obvious limitation of this system is the excessive memory consumption due to the usage of language specific models. For low resource languages this system is difficult to train and scale.\nWe hope that these problems will be addressed by researchers in future works.", "answers": ["85.61%."], "length": 2395, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c6d0de0391867185e00e945075301d33fc1c5c05d2a7d082"}

{"input": "When did Simon English become the leader of the National Party?", "context": "Sir Simon William English  (born 30 December 1961) is a New Zealand former National Party politician who served as the 39th prime minister of New Zealand from 2016 to 2017. He had previously served as the 17th deputy prime minister of New Zealand and minister of finance from 2008 to 2016 under John Key and the Fifth National Government.\n\nA farmer and public servant before entering politics, English was elected to the New Zealand Parliament in  as the National Party's candidate in the Wallace electorate. He was elevated to Cabinet in 1996 and in 1999 was made minister of finance, although he served for less than a year due to his party's loss at the 1999 general election. In October 2001, English replaced Jenny Shipley as the leader of the National Party (and consequently as Leader of the Opposition). He led the party to its worst defeat at the 2002 general election, and as a consequence, in October 2003 he was replaced as leader by Don Brash.\n\nIn November 2006, after Brash's resignation, English became deputy leader under John Key. After National's victory at the 2008 general election, he became deputy prime minister and was also made minister of finance for the second time. Under English's direction New Zealand's economy maintained steady growth during National's three terms of government. He became a list-only MP after stepping down as an electorate MP at the 2014 general election.\n\nJohn Key resigned as leader of the National Party and prime minister in December 2016. English won the resulting leadership election unopposed and was sworn in as prime minister on 12 December 2016. His tenure was only ten months, and included a three-month election campaign. In the 2017 general election, National won the largest number of seats but fell short of a majority. The parties holding the balance of power declined to support the existing government, and English was subsequently replaced as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern, leader of the Labour Party. English initially continued on as Leader of the Opposition, but resigned as leader of the National Party on 27 February 2018 and left parliament two weeks later.\n\nEarly life\nEnglish was born on 30 December 1961 at Lumsden Maternity Centre in Lumsden. He is the eleventh of twelve children of Mervyn English and Norah (née O'Brien) English. His parents purchased Rosedale, a mixed sheep and cropping farm in Dipton, Southland from Mervyn's uncle, Vincent English, a bachelor, in 1944. English was born in the maternity unit at Lumsden.\n\nEnglish attended St Thomas's School in Winton, then boarded at St. Patrick's College in Upper Hutt, where he became head boy. He played in the first XV of the school's rugby team. English went on to study commerce at the University of Otago, where he was a resident at Selwyn College, and then completed an honours degree in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nAfter finishing his studies, English returned to Dipton and farmed for a few years. From 1987 to 1989, he worked in Wellington as a policy analyst for the New Zealand Treasury, at a time when the free market policies favoured by Labour's finance minister Roger Douglas (known collectively as \"Rogernomics\") were being implemented.\n\nEnglish joined the National Party in 1980, while at Victoria University. He served for a period as chairman of the Southland branch of the Young Nationals, and became a member of the Wallace electorate committee. After moving to Wellington, he served for periods on the Island Bay and Miramar electorate committees, respectively.\n\nFourth National Government (1990–1999)\n\nAt the 1990 general election, English stood as the National candidate in Wallace, replacing the retiring Derek Angus, and was elected with a large majority. He would hold this seat, renamed Clutha-Southland in 1996, until 2014. He and three other newly elected National MPs (Tony Ryall, Nick Smith, and Roger Sowry) were soon identified as rising stars in New Zealand politics, and at various points were dubbed the \"brat pack\", the \"gang of four\", and the \"young Turks\". In his first term in parliament, English chaired a select committee into social services. He was made a parliamentary under-secretary in 1993, serving under the Minister of Health.\n\nFirst period in cabinet (1996–1999)\nIn early 1996, English was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Jim Bolger, becoming the Minister for Crown Health Enterprises and Associate Minister of Education (to Wyatt Creech). He was 34 at the time, becoming the cabinet's youngest member. After the 1996 general election, the National Party was forced into a coalition with New Zealand First to retain government. In the resulting cabinet reshuffle, English emerged as Minister of Health. However, as a condition of the coalition agreement, NZ First's Neil Kirton (a first-term MP) was made Associate Minister of Health, effectively becoming English's deputy. This arrangement was described in the press as a \"shotgun marriage\", and there were frequent differences of opinion between the two ministers. After their relationship became unworkable, Kirton was sacked from the role in August 1997, with the agreement of NZ First leader Winston Peters.\n\nAs Minister of Health, English was responsible for continuing the reforms to the public health system that National had begun after the 1990 general election. The reforms were unpopular, and health was perceived as one of the government's weaknesses, with the health portfolio consequently being viewed as a challenge. English believed that the unpopularity of the reforms was in part due to a failure in messaging, and encouraged his National colleagues to avoid bureaucratic and money-focused language (such as references to \"balance sheets\" and \"user charges\") and instead talk about the improvements to services the government's reforms would bring. He also rejected the idea that public hospitals could be run as commercial enterprises, a view which some of his colleagues had previously promoted.\n\nBy early 1997, as dissatisfaction with Bolger's leadership began to grow, English was being touted as a potential successor, along with Jenny Shipley and Doug Graham. His age (35) was viewed as the main impediment to a successful leadership run. National's leadership troubles were resolved in December 1997, when Bolger resigned and Shipley was elected to the leadership unopposed. English had been a supporter of Bolger as leader, but Shipley reappointed him Minister of Health in her new cabinet.\n\nEnglish was promoted to Minister of Finance in a reshuffle in January 1999, a position which was at the time subordinate to the Treasurer, Bill Birch. After a few months, the pair switched positions as part of Birch's transition to retirement, with English assuming the senior portfolio. In early interviews, he emphasised his wish to be seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, and said that the initiatives of some of his predecessors (Roger Douglas's \"Rogernomics\" and Ruth Richardson's \"Ruthanasia\") had focused on \"fruitless, theoretical debates\" when \"people just want to see problems solved\".\n\nOpposition (1999–2008)\n\nAfter the National Party lost the 1999 election to Helen Clark's Labour Party, English continued on in the shadow cabinet as National's spokesperson for finance. He was elected deputy leader of the party in February 2001, following the resignation of Wyatt Creech, with Gerry Brownlee being his unsuccessful opponent.\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nIn October 2001, after months of speculation, Jenny Shipley resigned as leader of the National Party after being told she no longer had the support of the party caucus. English was elected as her replacement unopposed (with Roger Sowry as his deputy), and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. However, he did not openly organise against Shipley, and according to The Southland Times \"there was almost an element of 'aw, shucks, I'll do it then' about Mr English's ascension\".\n\nAged 39 when he was elected, English became the second-youngest leader in the National Party's history, after Jim McLay (who was 38 when elected in 1984). He also became only the third Southlander to lead a major New Zealand political party, after Joseph Ward and Adam Hamilton. However, English failed to improve the party's performance. In the 2002 election, National suffered its worst electoral defeat ever, gaining barely more than twenty percent of the vote. English described it as \"the worst day of my political life\". Both party insiders and the general public were split as to how much to blame him for the loss, but most of the party believed that English would be able to rebuild National's support.\n\nBy late 2003, however, National's performance in opinion polls remained poor. The party had briefly increased its popularity in the year following the election, but by October its support had fallen to levels only slightly better than what it achieved in the last ballot. English also appeared in a boxing match for a charity against entertainer Ted Clarke. This did not boost his polling or that of the National party either, with suggestions that it devalued his image as a serious politician. Don Brash, former governor of the Reserve Bank and a relative newcomer to politics, began to build up support to replace English. On 28 October, Brash gained sufficient backing in Caucus to defeat English in a leadership contest.\n\nShadow cabinet roles and deputy leader\nOn 2 November 2003, when Brash changed responsibilities for certain MPs, English became National's spokesman for education, ranked at fifth place in the party's parliamentary hierarchy. He remained in parliament after the 2005 election. In his new shadow education portfolio, English performed strongly, and remained a party favourite despite his election defeat as leader in 2002, eventually being returned to the finance portfolio in August 2004 as deputy spokesman (while still retaining responsibility for education).\n\nIn November 2006, Brash resigned as leader. English was considered as a potential replacement leader (running against John Key) or deputy leader (against incumbent Gerry Brownlee) in the ensuing leadership election. However, a contest was avoided when the MPs agreed a Key/English ticket would run unopposed in a display of party unity. English took over the deputy leadership and the finance portfolio in the Key shadow cabinet.\n\nFifth National Government (2008–2017)\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (2008–2016)\n\nAt the 2008 election, English was re-elected by his electorate, winning by a margin of about 15,500 votes. He became Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand and Minister of Finance in the fifth National Government, being sworn into office on 19 November 2008 and continued to serve in those roles until becoming Prime Minister on 12 December 2014. He was also made Minister of Infrastructure in National's first term of government and Minister responsible for Housing New Zealand Corporation and minister responsible for the New Zealand flag consideration process in its third.\n\nHe was comfortably re-elected in Clutha-Southland in the 2011 election but opted to run as a party-list candidate in 2014. \n\nThe pairing of John Key as leader of the National Party and English as his deputy has been compared to that of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating (in Australia) and Tony Blair and Gordon Brown (in the UK).\n\nEnglish acceded to the role of Finance Minister in the continuing wake of the financial crisis. In response to New Zealand's rising debt, English made budget deficit-reduction his main priority. His first budget outlined three focuses in New Zealand's financial recovery: \"improving the business environment and removing roadblocks to growth; investment in productive infrastructure; and improving the way government works\". One of his first acts was creating the National Infrastructure Unit, charged with formulating a plan for infrastructure projects and investments. He commissioned a government-wide spending review, with an aim to reducing government expenditure—with the exceptions of a two-year stimulus package and long-term increases on infrastructure spending.\n\nIn April 2011, the Opposition criticised English for suggesting that New Zealand businesses could use New Zealand's low wages to help it compete with Australia. The National Government campaigned for re-election in 2011 on its economic record. The Government boasted growth for five consecutive quarters up to mid-2010, totalling 1.6% of real GDP.\n\nStrong growth resulted in a surplus of $473 million for the 2015/16 financial year, projected to rise to $8.5 billion by 2020/21. In his 2016 Economic and Fiscal Update address, English stated that reducing debt and tackling the costs of the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake were higher priorities than reducing rates of tax.\n\nAllowances issue\nIn 2009, the media, including TVNZ and TV3 revealed that English was receiving about NZ$900 a week as part of a living allowance for ministers, to live in his own NZ$1.2 million Wellington home. At the time, English also received $276,200 in his annual salary as Deputy Prime Minister. It was also revealed other ministers with homes in the capital city were also claiming accommodation allowances. On 3 August 2009, Prime Minister John Key started a review of the housing allowances claimed by cabinet ministers. English subsequently paid back $12,000 and only claimed about $24,000 a year in living allowances. The Auditor-General's office said in September 2009 that they were making \"preliminary enquiries\" into parliamentary housing expenses in response to a letter of complaint from Progressive party leader Jim Anderton. Two days later English stated that he would no longer take up any housing allowance and had paid back all the allowance he had received since the November 2008 election.\n\nPrime Minister (2016–2017)\n\nJohn Key resigned on 12 December, and endorsed English as his successor in the resulting leadership election. Following the drop-out of both Judith Collins and Jonathan Coleman from the leadership election, English was sworn in as the 39th Prime Minister of New Zealand on 12 December 2016.\n\nEnglish appointed his first cabinet on 18 December. In a reshuffle, he appointed Steven Joyce to succeed him as Finance Minister, while most ministerial portfolios remained the same.\n\nIn February 2017, English did not attend Waitangi Day commemorations at the historic treaty grounds, reportedly in response to the Ngāpuhi iwi's decision to stop the Prime Minister from speaking at the marae. Ngāpuhi have protested the Government's negotiation of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), which the iwi believe infringes upon Māori sovereignty, and thus does not adhere to the Treaty of Waitangi. English had been invited to attend in an official capacity; his non-attendance was criticised by a Ngāpuhi elder and Opposition leader Andrew Little.\n\nIn his first overseas trip as Prime Minister, English travelled to Europe to discuss trade ties, including a prospective New Zealand–European Union free trade agreement. He first travelled to London on 13 January 2017 to meet British Prime Minister Theresa May. Discussing trade relations, English said the two nations were \"natural partners\" and would \"continue to forge ties\" after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. He also arranged to meet with London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  In a meeting with Merkel, English received crucial backing from Germany for a trade deal with the EU. On 16 January, English stated that his government would continue to promote TPPA, despite the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement. He explained that Southeast Asian countries would now be treated as a priority in negotiations—he also asserted that the United States was ceding influence to China by its rejection of the trade pact.\n\nAt a press conference at the Beehive on 1 February 2017, English announced that the 2017 general election would be held on 23 September. The Prime Minister later confirmed that his party would approach ACT, United Future and the Māori Party if confidence and supply agreements were required to form a government following the election. In his second cabinet reshuffle on 24 April, English appointed Gerry Brownlee as his new Foreign Affairs Minister; he also promoted Nikki Kaye to the portfolio of Education Minister, and moved Mark Mitchell into the cabinet to become Defence Minister. The reshuffle was perceived as an election preparation.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, English welcomed Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to Wellington. The two leaders reaffirmed their shared trade agenda, and discussed changes to the Australian citizenship pathway which will affect permanent residents originating from New Zealand.\n\nOn 19 June, it was reported that Todd Barclay, who succeeded English as MP for Clutha-Southland, had clandestinely recorded one of his employee's conversations the previous year, and that John Key's leaders' budget was used to pay a confidential settlement after the employee resigned. English admitted that he had been aware of the illegal recording and the settlement, and thus implicated in the scandal.\n\nDuring the 2017 National campaign launch, English introduced a $379 million social investment package including digital learning academies for high school students, more resources for mathematics, and boosting support for teaching second languages in schools, and maintaining National Standards in the school curriculum. Prime Minister English also sought to defend National's financial management and economic track record and claimed that the opposition Labour Party would raise taxes. Early opinion polling had forecast a poor showing in the election for the Labour Party, but in early August 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern took over as Labour leader and seemingly energised younger voters.\n\nAt the 2017 general election, National won the largest share of the party vote (44.4%) and the largest number of seats (56) in the House Representatives. However, National lacked enough seats to govern alone due to two of the party's support partners, the Māori Party and United Future, losing their parliamentary seats. In response, English stated that the party would be entering into talks to form a coalition with New Zealand First. Following talks with the two largest parties, New Zealand First entered a coalition arrangement with the Labour Party. English was succeeded as prime minister by Jacinda Ardern on 26 October.\n\nOpposition (2017–2018)\n\nLeader of the Opposition\nEnglish was re-elected as National Party leader on 24 October 2017. At the time of his re-election, English announced his intention to stay on as leader until the next general election. On 13 February 2018, however, he stood down as National Party leader due to personal reasons, and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. He also retired from Parliament. English's resignation followed weeks of speculation that he would step aside for a new leader. On 27 February, he was succeeded as party leader by Simon Bridges as the result of the leadership election held that day.\n\nPost-premiership \nIn 2018, English joined the board of Australian conglomerate, Wesfarmers. English serves in Chairmanships of Mount Cook Alpine Salmon, Impact Lab Ltd and Manawanui Support Ltd. He is also a director of The Instillery, Centre for Independent Studies and The Todd Corporation Limited, and is a member of the Impact Advisory Group of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets.\n\nPolitical and social views\n\nEnglish is regarded as more socially conservative than his predecessor, John Key. He has stated his opposition to voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, same-sex civil unions, and the decriminalisation of prostitution. As Prime Minister he opposed any \"liberalisation\" of abortion law.\n\nIn 2004, English voted against a bill to establish civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. In 2005, he voted for the Marriage (Gender Clarification) Amendment Bill, which would have amended the Marriage Act to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. English voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill that legalised same-sex marriage in New Zealand. However, in December 2016 he stated, \"I'd probably vote differently now on the gay marriage issue. I don't think that gay marriage is a threat to anyone else's marriage\".\n\nIn 2009, English voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill, a bill aimed at amending the Misuse of Drugs Act so that cannabis could be used for medical purposes.\n\nPersonal life \nEnglish met his future wife, Mary Scanlon, at university. She was studying medicine at the time, and became a general practitioner. Both her parents were immigrants, her father being Samoan and her mother Italian, born on the island of Stromboli. They have six children: a daughter and five sons.\n\nEnglish is a practising Roman Catholic, but has stated that he considers his religious beliefs personal and thus separate from politics.\n\nIn June 2002, English took part in TV3's Fight For Life, a celebrity boxing fundraiser to raise money for the Yellow Ribbon anti-youth-suicide campaign, influenced by the death of a teenage nephew in 1997. He lost a split decision to former university colleague Ted Clarke.\n\nHonours\nIn the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours, English was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services of over 27 years to the State.\n\nSee also\n\nList of New Zealand governments\nPolitics of New Zealand\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nProfile at National Party \nProfile on Parliament.nz\nReleases and speeches at Beehive.govt.nz\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1961 births\n21st-century New Zealand politicians\nCandidates in the 2017 New Zealand general election\nDeputy Prime Ministers of New Zealand\nLeaders of the Opposition (New Zealand)\nLiving people\nMembers of the Cabinet of New Zealand\nMembers of the New Zealand House of Representatives\nNew Zealand farmers\nNew Zealand finance ministers\nNew Zealand list MPs\nNew Zealand MPs for South Island electorates\nNew Zealand National Party MPs\nNew Zealand National Party leaders\nNew Zealand Roman Catholics\nNew Zealand people of Irish descent\nPeople educated at St. Patrick's College, Silverstream\nPeople from Dipton, New Zealand\nPeople from Lumsden, New Zealand\nPrime Ministers of New Zealand\nUniversity of Otago alumni\nVictoria University of Wellington alumni\nKnights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit\n", "answers": ["October 2001."], "length": 3590, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "67dd297408f3d52f22ede88df0b62644dac86da77f009e71"}
{"input": "What algorithm is engaged in the PLMS-PPIC method?", "context": "\\section{Introduction}\\label{S1}\n\nThe multiple access interferences (MAI) is the root of user\nlimitation in CDMA systems \\cite{R1,R3}. The parallel least mean\nsquare-partial parallel interference cancelation (PLMS-PPIC) method\nis a multiuser detector for code division multiple access (CDMA)\nreceivers which reduces the effect of MAI in bit detection. In this\nmethod and similar to its former versions like LMS-PPIC \\cite{R5}\n(see also \\cite{RR5}), a weighted value of the MAI of other users is\nsubtracted before making the decision for a specific user in\ndifferent stages \\cite{cohpaper}. In both of these methods, the\nnormalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm is engaged\n\\cite{Haykin96}. The $m^{\\rm th}$ element of the weight vector in\neach stage is the true transmitted binary value of the $m^{\\rm th}$\nuser divided by its hard estimate value from the previous stage. The\nmagnitude of all weight elements in all stages are equal to unity.\nUnlike the LMS-PPIC, the PLMS-PPIC method tries to keep this\nproperty in each iteration by using a set of NLMS algorithms with\ndifferent step-sizes instead of one NLMS algorithm used in LMS-PPIC.\nIn each iteration, the parameter estimate of the NLMS algorithm is\nchosen whose element magnitudes of cancelation weight estimate have\nthe best match with unity. In PLMS-PPIC implementation it is assumed\nthat the receiver knows the phases of all user channels. However in\npractice, these phases are not known and should be estimated. In\nthis paper we improve the PLMS-PPIC procedure \\cite{cohpaper} in\nsuch a way that when there is only a partial information of the\nchannel phases, this modified version simultaneously estimates the\nphases and the cancelation weights. The partial information is the\nquarter of each channel phase in $(0,2\\pi)$.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section \\ref{S4}\nthe modified version of PLMS-PPIC with capability of channel phase\nestimation is introduced. In section \\ref{S5} some simulation\nexamples illustrate the results of the proposed method. Finally the\npaper is concluded in section \\ref{S6}.\n\n\\section{Multistage Parallel Interference Cancelation: Modified PLMS-PPIC Method}\\label{S4}\n\nWe assume $M$ users synchronously send their symbols\n$\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\cdots,\\alpha_M$ via a base-band CDMA\ntransmission system where $\\alpha_m\\in\\{-1,1\\}$. The $m^{th}$ user\nhas its own code $p_m(.)$ of length $N$, where $p_m(n)\\in \\{-1,1\\}$,\nfor all $n$. It means that for each symbol $N$ bits are transmitted\nby each user and the processing gain is equal to $N$. At the\nreceiver we assume that perfect power control scheme is applied.\nWithout loss of generality, we also assume that the power gains of\nall channels are equal to unity and users' channels do not change\nduring each symbol transmission (it can change from one symbol\ntransmission to the next one) and the channel phase $\\phi_m$ of\n$m^{th}$ user is unknown for all $m=1,2,\\cdots,M$ (see\n\\cite{cohpaper} for coherent transmission). According to the above\nassumptions the received signal is\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e1} r(n)=\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}\\alpha_m\ne^{j\\phi_m}p_m(n)+v(n),~~~~n=1,2,\\cdots,N,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $v(n)$ is the additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and\nvariance $\\sigma^2$. Multistage parallel interference cancelation\nmethod uses $\\alpha^{s-1}_1,\\alpha^{s-1}_2,\\cdots,\\alpha^{s-1}_M$,\nthe bit estimates outputs of the previous stage, $s-1$, to estimate\nthe related MAI of each user. It then subtracts it from the received\nsignal $r(n)$ and makes a new decision on each user variable\nindividually to make a new variable set\n$\\alpha^{s}_1,\\alpha^{s}_2,\\cdots,\\alpha^{s}_M$ for the current\nstage $s$. Usually the variable set of the first stage (stage $0$)\nis the output of a conventional detector. The output of the last\nstage is considered as the final estimate of transmitted bits. In\nthe following we explain the structure of a modified version of the\nPLMS-PIC method \\cite{cohpaper} with simultaneous capability of\nestimating the cancelation weights and the channel phases.\n\nAssume $\\alpha_m^{(s-1)}\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ is a given estimate of\n$\\alpha_m$ from stage $s-1$. Define\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e6} w^s_{m}=\\frac{\\alpha_m}{\\alpha_m^{(s-1)}}e^{j\\phi_m}.\n\\end{equation}\nFrom (\\ref{e1}) and (\\ref{e6}) we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e7} r(n)=\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}w^s_m\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m\np_m(n)+v(n).\n\\end{equation}\nDefine\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{e8} W^s&=&[w^s_{1},w^s_{2},\\cdots,w^s_{M}]^T,\\\\\n\\label{e9}\n\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!X^{s}(n)\\!\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\![\\alpha^{(s-1)}_1p_1(n),\\alpha^{(s-1)}_2p_2(n),\\cdots,\\alpha^{(s-1)}_Mp_M(n)]^T.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere $T$ stands for transposition. From equations (\\ref{e7}),\n(\\ref{e8}) and (\\ref{e9}), we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e10} r(n)=W^{s^T}X^{s}(n)+v(n).\n\\end{equation}\nGiven the observations $\\{r(n),X^{s}(n)\\}^{N}_{n=1}$, in modified\nPLMS-PPIC, like the PLMS-PPIC \\cite{cohpaper}, a set of NLMS\nadaptive algorithm are used to compute\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{te1} W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich is an estimate of $W^s$ after iteration $N$. To do so, from\n(\\ref{e6}), we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e13} |w^s_{m}|=1 ~~~m=1,2,\\cdots,M,\n\\end{equation}\nwhich is equivalent to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e14} \\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m}|-1|=0.\n\\end{equation}\nWe divide $\\Psi=\\left(0,1-\\sqrt{\\frac{M-1}{M}}\\right]$, a sharp\nrange for $\\mu$ (the step-size of the NLMS algorithm) given in\n\\cite{sg2005}, into $L$ subintervals and consider $L$ individual\nstep-sizes $\\Theta=\\{\\mu_1,\\mu_2,\\cdots,\\mu_L\\}$, where\n$\\mu_1=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{\\frac{M-1}{M}}}{L}, \\mu_2=2\\mu_1,\\cdots$, and\n$\\mu_L=L\\mu_1$. In each stage, $L$ individual NLMS algorithms are\nexecuted ($\\mu_l$ is the step-size of the $l^{th}$ algorithm). In\nstage $s$ and at iteration $n$, if\n$W^{s}_k(n)=[w^s_{1,k},\\cdots,w^s_{M,k}]^T$, the parameter estimate\nof the $k^{\\rm th}$ algorithm, minimizes our criteria, then it is\nconsidered as the parameter estimate at time iteration $n$. In other\nwords if the next equation holds\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e17} W^s_k(n)=\\arg\\min\\limits_{W^s_l(n)\\in I_{W^s}\n}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{m=1}^{M}||w^s_{m,l}(n)|-1|\\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $W^{s}_l(n)=W^{s}(n-1)+\\mu_l \\frac{X^s(n)}{\\|X^s(n)\\|^2}e(n),\n~~~ l=1,2,\\cdots,k,\\cdots,L-1,L$ and\n$I_{W^s}=\\{W^s_1(n),\\cdots,W^s_L(n)\\}$, then we have\n$W^s(n)=W^s_k(n)$, and therefore all other algorithms replace their\nweight estimate by $W^{s}_k(n)$. At time instant $n=N$, this\nprocedure gives $W^s(N)$, the final estimate of $W^s$, as the true\nparameter of stage $s$.\n\nNow consider $R=(0,2\\pi)$ and divide it into four equal parts\n$R_1=(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, $R_2=(\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi)$,\n$R_3=(\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2})$ and $R_4=(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},2\\pi)$. The\npartial information of channel phases (given by the receiver) is in\na way that it shows each $\\phi_m$ ($m=1,2,\\cdots,M$) belongs to\nwhich one of the four quarters $R_i,~i=1,2,3,4$. Assume\n$W^{s}(N)=[w^{s}_1(N),w^{s}_2(N),\\cdots,w^{s}_M(N)]^T$ is the weight\nestimate of the modified algorithm PLMS-PPIC at time instant $N$ of\nthe stage $s$. From equation (\\ref{e6}) we have\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{tt3}\n\\phi_m=\\angle({\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}w^s_m}).\n\\end{equation}\nWe estimate $\\phi_m$ by $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m$, where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ee3}\n\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\angle{(\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}w^s_m(N))}.\n\\end{equation}\nBecause $\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=1$ or $-1$, we have\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll} \\angle{w^s_m(N)} &\n\\mbox{if}~\n\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=1\\\\\n\\pm\\pi+\\angle{w^s_m(N)} & \\mbox{if}~\n\\frac{\\alpha^{(s-1)}_m}{\\alpha_m}=-1\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHence $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m\\in P^s=\\{\\angle{w^s_m(N)},\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)+\\pi, \\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi}\\}$. If $w^s_m(N)$\nsufficiently converges to its true value $w^s_m$, the same region\nfor $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m$ and $\\phi_m$ is expected. In this case only one\nof the three members of $P^s$ has the same region as $\\phi_m$. For\nexample if $\\phi_m \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, then $\\hat{\\phi}^s_m \\in\n(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ and therefore only $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}$ or\n$\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi$ or $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi$ belongs to\n$(0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$. If, for example, $\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi$ is such\na member between all three members of $P^s$, it is the best\ncandidate for phase estimation. In other words,\n\\[\\phi_m\\approx\\hat{\\phi}^s_m=\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi.\\]\nWe admit that when there is a member of $P^s$ in the quarter of\n$\\phi_m$, then $w^s_m(N)$ converges. What would happen when non of\nthe members of $P^s$ has the same quarter as $\\phi_m$? This\nsituation will happen when the absolute difference between $\\angle\nw^s_m(N)$ and $\\phi_m$ is greater than $\\pi$. It means that\n$w^s_m(N)$ has not converged yet. In this case where we can not\ncount on $w^s_m(N)$, the expected value is the optimum choice for\nthe channel phase estimation, e.g. if $\\phi_m \\in (0,\\frac{\\pi}{2})$\nthen $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase\n$\\phi_m$, or if $\\phi_m \\in (\\frac{\\pi}{2},\\pi)$ then\n$\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ is the estimation of the channel phase $\\phi_m$.\nThe results of the above discussion are summarized in the next\nequation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nonumber \\hat{\\phi}^s_m = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{llll} \\angle\n{w^s_m(N)} & \\mbox{if}~\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)}, \\phi_m\\in R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi & \\mbox{if}~ \\angle{w^s_m(N)}+\\pi, \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\angle{w^n_m(N)}-\\pi & \\mbox{if}~ \\angle{w^s_m(N)}-\\pi, \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~i=1,2,3,4\\\\\n\\frac{(i-1)\\pi+i\\pi}{4} & \\mbox{if}~ \\phi_m\\in\nR_i,~~\\angle{w^s_m(N)},\\angle\n{w^s_m(N)}\\pm\\pi\\notin R_i,~~i=1,2,3,4.\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHaving an estimation of the channel phases, the rest of the proposed\nmethod is given by estimating $\\alpha^{s}_m$ as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{tt4}\n\\alpha^{s}_m=\\mbox{sign}\\left\\{\\mbox{real}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{N}\nq^s_m(n)e^{-j\\hat{\\phi}^s_m}p_m(n)\\right\\}\\right\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere\n\\begin{equation} \\label{tt5}\nq^{s}_{m}(n)=r(n)-\\sum\\limits_{m^{'}=1,m^{'}\\ne\nm}^{M}w^{s}_{m^{'}}(N)\\alpha^{(s-1)}_{m^{'}} p_{m^{'}}(n).\n\\end{equation}\nThe inputs of the first stage $\\{\\alpha^{0}_m\\}_{m=1}^M$ (needed for\ncomputing $X^1(n)$) are given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{qte5}\n\\alpha^{0}_m=\\mbox{sign}\\left\\{\\mbox{real}\\left\\{\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{N}\nr(n)e^{-j\\hat{\\phi}^0_m}p_m(n)\\right\\}\\right\\}.\n\\end{equation}\nAssuming $\\phi_m\\in R_i$, then\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{qqpp} \\hat{\\phi}^0_m =\\frac{(i-1)\\pi+i\\pi}{4}.\n\\end{equation}\nTable \\ref{tab4} shows the structure of the modified PLMS-PPIC\nmethod.

{"input": "What is the scaling form for the alternative order parameter O?", "context": "\\section*{Dynamical Behaviour of $O$ in Lattice Gases}\n\nThe dynamical behaviour of the anisotropic order parameter  $m$ [see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-m} in the Letter] following a quench to the critical point is well described by\nthe Gaussian theory for all the three lattice gas models studied, $i.e.,$ driven lattice gas with either constant (IDLG) or random (RDLG) infinite drive and equilibrium lattice gas (LG). In other words, in the short-time regime, $m \\sim t^{1/2}$ [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:mt}] and the Binder cumulant $g$ of the lowest transverse mode [defined in Eq. \\eqref{eq:binder}] is zero in this regime. The alternative order parameter $O,$ however, distinguishes between the driven (IDLG, RDLG) and the equilibrium (LG) lattice gases. \n\nIn order to understand  this, we first write the phenomenological scaling form for $O$,  analogous to Eq. \\eqref{eq:scalingass} in  the Letter,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO (t, L_{\\parallel} ; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O (t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)} ; S_\\Delta).\\quad\n\\label{eq:Oscalingass}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe already remarked that, in the LG, this scaling form is not compatible with the prediction $O \\sim t^{1/8}  L_{\\parallel}^{-1/2}$ of the Gaussian theory.  However, following Ref. \\cite{AS2002}, it can be argued that, at short times, the only dependence of $O$ on the system size $L_{\\parallel}$ is of the form $O \\sim L_\\parallel^{-1/2}$ which is very well confirmed by numerical simulations. Accordingly,  the generic behaviour of $O$ can be assumed to be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO \\sim t^{\\alpha} L_\\parallel^{-1/2}, \\label{eq:O}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a phenomenological exponent to be determined. This, along with Eq. \\eqref{eq:Oscalingass}, implies $\\tilde f_O(x) \\sim x^{\\alpha}.$ Comparing the finite-size behaviour in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:O} with Eq.~\\eqref{eq:Oscalingass} one actually infers,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\alpha &=& \\frac{1+ \\Delta -2 \\beta/\\nu}{2 \\, (4- \\eta)}. \\label{eq:alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis equation, together with the hyperscaling relation $\\Delta - 2 \\beta/\\nu= - \\eta$ in two spatial dimensions, shows that the prediction $\\alpha = 1/8$ of the Gaussian theory [see Eq. \\eqref{eq:Ot}] can be obtained only when $\\eta=0,$ which is the case for the IDLG (exactly) and the RDLG (approximately) but not for the LG. \n\nOn the other hand,  Eq.~\\eqref{eq:alpha} predicts $\\alpha = 1/10$ upon substituting the values of the critical exponents corresponding to the Ising  universality class (LG). This is consistent with the numerical simulation results presented in the main text, see Fig. \\ref{fig:ising}(b) therein.\n\n\\begin{figure}[th]\n\\vspace*{0.2 cm}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=10 cm]{./compare_binder.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Comparison between the temporal evolution of the Binder cumulants $g$ corresponding to the $12^{th}$ transverse mode, $i.e.,$ with $n_\\perp =12,$ in the LG (lowest curve), IDLG and RDLG (two upper curves) on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. \\label{fig:b}}\n \\label{fig:binder}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe emergence of this new value $1/10$ of the exponent $\\alpha$ must be traced back to the non-Gaussian nature of higher fluctuating modes in the LG. In fact, even though the lowest mode behaves identically in all the three models we considered,  characterized by the same behaviour of $m$, higher modes show a significant difference in the non-driven case.  \n\n\nTo illustrate this, we measured the Binder cumulants of higher modes which is defined  analogously to Eq.~(11), using transverse modes other than the first, i.e., with $\\mu=\\tilde \\sigma(0,2 \\pi n_\\bot/L_\\bot)$ and $n_\\bot>1.$  \n Figure \\ref{fig:b} compares the same for all the three lattice gases for the mode with $n_\\perp =12$ on a $32 \\times 32$ lattice. Clearly, the curve corresponding to the LG (lowest, blue) departs from Gaussian behaviour $g=0$ (in practice, $e.g.,$ $|g| \\lesssim 0.005,$ corresponding to the shaded gray area) much earlier than it does for the IDLG  or RDLG (two upper curves, red and green respectively).\n\nAccordingly, the different dynamical behaviour of $O$, which involves a sum over all modes, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian nature of the higher modes in the LG. \nSuch a departure is not entirely surprising. In fact, for higher modes, mesoscopic descriptions such as the ones in Eqs. \\eqref{eq:L-DLG} or \\eqref{eq:g_evol} are not expected to hold, while the anisotropy at the microscopic level could be the mechanism leading to the Gaussianity of higher modes in the driven models.\n\n", "answers": ["O(t, L_{\\parallel}; S_\\Delta) = L_{\\parallel}^{-\\beta/[\\nu(1+\\Delta)]} \\tilde f_O(t/L_{\\parallel}^{z/(1+\\Delta)}; S_\\Delta)."], "length": 663, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "22034e095a602824678c4028e6f605919ce520270dc06089"}

While at the academy, he earned a nickname \"Huge\" and among his classmates were several future admirals and generals including: Hyman G. Rickover, Milton E. Miles, Robert E. Blick Jr., Herbert S. Duckworth, Clayton C. Jerome, James P. Riseley, James A. Stuart, Frank Peak Akers, Sherman Clark, Raymond P. Coffman, Delbert S. Cornwell, Frederick J. Eckhoff, Ralph B. DeWitt, John Higgins, Vernon Huber, Albert K. Morehouse, Harold F. Pullen, Michael J. Malanaphy, William S. Parsons, Harold R. Stevens, John P. Whitney, Lyman G. Miller and George J. O'Shea.\n\nGoodwin graduated with Bachelor of Science degree on June 3, 1922, and was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy. He was subsequently assigned to the battleship  and took part in the voyage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, before he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island for submarine instruction in June 1923. Goodwin completed the training several weeks later and was attached to the submarine . He then continued his further training aboard submarine  and following his promotion to Lieutenant (junior grade) on June 3, 1925, he qualified as submariner.\n\nHe then served aboard submarine  off the coast of California, before he was ordered for the recruiting duty to San Francisco in September 1927. While in this capacity, Goodwin applied for naval aviation training which was ultimately approved and he was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in August 1928. Toward the end of the training, he was promoted to lieutenant on December 11, 1928, and upon the completion of the training in January 1929, he was designated Naval aviator.\n\nGoodwin was subsequently attached to the Observation Squadron aboard the aircraft carrier  and participated in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean. He was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. in August 1931 and served consecutively under the architect of naval aviation William A. Moffett and future Chief of Naval Operations Ernest J. King.\n\nIn June 1933, Goodwin was ordered to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, where he completed junior course in May of the following year. He subsequently joined the crew of aircraft carrier  and served under Captain Arthur B. Cook and took part in the Fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States.\n\nHe was ordered back to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in June 1936 and was attached to the staff of the Base Commandant, then-Captain Charles A. Blakely. When Blakely was succeeded by William F. Halsey in June 1937, Goodwin remained in Halsey's staff and was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on December 1, 1937. He also completed correspondence course in International law at the Naval War College.\n\nGoodwin was appointed Commanding officer of the Observation Squadron 1 in June 1938 and attached to the battleship  he took part in the patrolling of the Pacific and \nWest Coast of the United States until September 1938, when he assumed command of the Observation Squadron 2 attached to the battleship .\n\nWhen his old superior from Lexington, now Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, was appointed Commander Aircraft, Scouting Force in June 1939, he requested Goodwin as his Aide and Flag Secretary. He became Admiral Cook's protégé and after year and half of service in the Pacific, he continued as his Aide and Flag Secretary, when Cook was appointed Commander Aircraft, Atlantic Fleet in November 1940.\n\nWorld War II\n\nFollowing the United States' entry into World War II, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Commander on January 1, 1942, and assumed duty as advisor to the Argentine Navy. His promotion was made permanent two months later and he returned to the United States in early 1943 for duty as assistant director of Planning in the Bureau of Aeronautics under Rear admiral John S. McCain. While still in Argentina, Goodwin was promoted to the temporary rank of Captain on June 21, 1942.\n\nBy the end of December 1943, Goodwin was ordered to Astoria, Oregon, where he assumed command of newly commissioned escort carrier USS Gambier Bay. He was responsible for the initial training of the crew and was known as a strict disciplinarian, but the crew appreciated the skills he taught them that prepared them for combat. Goodwin insisted that everyone aboard has to do every job right every time and made us fight our ship at her best.\n\nDuring the first half of 1944, Gambier Bay was tasked with ferrying aircraft for repairs and qualified carrier pilots from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before departed on May 1, 1944, to join Rear admiral Harold B. Sallada's Carrier Support Group 2, staging in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas.\n\nThe air unit, VC-10 Squadron, under Goodwin's command gave close air support to the initial landings of Marines on Saipan on June 15, 1944, destroying enemy gun emplacements, troops, tanks, and trucks. On the 17th, her combat air patrol (CAP) shot down or turned back all but a handful of 47 enemy planes headed for her task group and her gunners shot down two of the three planes that did break through to attack her.\n\nGoodwin's carrier continued in providing of close ground support operations at Tinian during the end of July 1944, then turned her attention to Guam, where she gave identical aid to invading troops until mid-August that year. For his service during the Mariana Islands campaign, Goodwin was decorated with Bronze Star Medal with Combat \"V\".\n\nHe was succeeded by Captain Walter V. R. Vieweg on August 18, 1944, and appointed Chief of Staff, Carrier Division Six under Rear admiral Arthur W. Radford. The Gambier Bay was sunk in the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf after helping turn back a much larger attacking Japanese surface force.\n\nGoodwin served with Carrier Division Six during the Bonin Islands raids, the naval operations at Palau and took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf and operations supporting Leyte landings in late 1944. He was later appointed Air Officer of the Philippine Sea Frontier under Rear admiral James L. Kauffman and remained with that command until the end of hostilities. For his service in the later part of World War II, Goodwin was decorated with Legion of Merit with Combat \"V\". He was also entitled to wear two Navy Presidential Unit Citations and Navy Unit Commendation.\n\nPostwar service\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, Goodwin assumed command of Light aircraft carrier  on August 24, 1945. The ship was tasked with air missions over Japan became mercy flights over Allied prisoner-of-war camps, dropping food and medicine until the men could be rescued. She was also present at Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.\n\nGoodwin returned with San Jacinto to the United States in mid-September 1945 and he was detached in January 1946. He subsequently served in the office of the Chief of Naval Operations until May that year, when he entered the instruction at National War College. Goodwin graduated in June 1947 and served on Secretary's committee for Research on Reorganization. Upon promotion to Rear admiral on April 1, 1949, Goodwin was appointed Chief of Staff and Aide to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet under Admiral William H. P. Blandy.\n\nRevolt of the Admirals\n\nIn April 1949, the budget's cuts and proposed reorganization of the United States Armed Forces by the Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson launched the wave of discontent between senior commanders in the United States Navy. Johnson proposed the merging of the Marine Corps into the Army, and reduce the Navy to a convoy-escort force.\n\nGoodwin's superior officer, Admiral Blandy was call to testify before the House Committee on Armed Services and his harsh statements for the defense of the Navy, costed him his career. Goodwin shared his views and openly criticized Secretary Johnson for having power concentrated in a single civilian executive, who is an appointee of the Government and not an elected representative of the people. He also criticized aspects of defense unification which permitted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to vote on arms policies of individual services, and thus \"rob\" the branches of autonomy.\n\nThe outbreak of the Korean War in summer 1950 proved the proposal of Secretary Johnson as incorrect and he resigned in September that year. Also Secretary of the Navy, Francis P. Matthews resigned one month earlier.\n\nLater service\n\nDue to the Revolts of the admirals, Blandy was forced to retire in February 1950 and Goodwin was ordered to Newport, Rhode Island for temporary duty as Chief of Staff and Aide to the President of the Naval War College under Vice admiral Donald B. Beary in April 1950. Goodwin was detached from that assignment two months and appointed member of the General Board of the Navy. He was shortly thereafter appointed acting Navy Chief of Public Information, as the substitute for Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey, who was relieved of illness, but returned to the General Board of the Navy in July that year. Goodwin served in that capacity until February 1951, when he relieved his Academy class, Rear admiral John P. Whitney as Vice Commander, Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nWhile in this capacity, Goodwin served under Lieutenant general Laurence S. Kuter and was co-responsible for the logistical support of United Nations troops fighting in Korea. The MATS operated from the United States to Japan and Goodwin served in this capacity until August 1953, when he was appointed Commander Carrier Division Two. While in this assignment, he took part in the Operation Mariner, Joint Anglo-American exercise which encountered very heavy seas over a two-week period in fall 1953.\n\nGoodwin was ordered to the Philippines in May 1954 and assumed duty as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces in the Philippines with headquarters at Naval Station Sangley Point near Cavite. He held that command in the period of tensions between Taiwan and China and publicly declared shortly after his arrival, that any attack on Taiwan by the Chinese Communists on the mainland would result in US participation in the conflict. The naval fighter planes under his command also provided escort for passing commercial planes. Goodwin worked together with retired Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, then-Ambassador to the Philippines, and accompanied him during the visits to Singapore, Bangkok and Saigon in January 1955.\n\nOn December 18, 1955, Goodwin's classmate Rear admiral Albert K. Morehouse, then serving as Commander, Naval Air Forces, Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD), died of heart attack and Goodwin was ordered to CONAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado to assume Morehouse's position. While in this capacity, he was subordinated to Army General Earle E. Partridge and was responsible for the Naval and Marine Forces allocated to the command designated for the defense of the Continental United States.\n\nRetirement\n\nGoodwin retired on June 1, 1957, after 40 years of active service and was advanced to the rank of Vice admiral on the retired list for having been specially commended in combat. A week later, he was invited back to his Monroe High School (now Neville High School) and handed a diploma showing that he had been graduated with the class of 1918. He then settled in Monterey, California where he taught American history at Stevenson school and was a member of the Naval Order of the United States.\n\nVice admiral Hugh H. Goodwin died at his home on February 25, 1980, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor with whom he had two children, a daughter Sidney and a son Hugh Jr., who graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1948, but died one year later, when the Hellcat fighter he was piloting collided with another over the Gulf of Mexico during training.\n\nDecorations\n\nHere is the ribbon bar of Vice admiral Hugh H.

{"input": "Who compiled the 88-page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety?", "context": "A special tribute to Del Bigtree (pictured) and his team at ICAN for his stunning 88 page letter to the HHS regarding vaccine safety. As Del reported - in the latest edition of Highwire - the letter, in response to an earlier reply from the then acting Director National Vaccine Program Office, Melinda Wharton, took virtually a year to compile, and is a meticulous piece of research. Most sensationally they researched the HHS claim through US government archives that at least some pediatric vaccines had been trialed against genuine placebo, and came to a negative conclusion. Not only that, they established that none of the vaccines those vaccines had been trialed against had ever been trialed against genuine placebo either. At the end of the line the toxic products were only being compared with other toxic products, rather than against saline.\nLeave aside the sceptics, for any believer in the vaccine program as a necessary intervention in public health, this should be a devastating finding. Fundamentally, the research into the safety of any of the products before marketing was simply not there. The manufacturers apparently had no faith that their proto-products could withstand this scrutiny, and for the rest they just did not care: under the alleged imperative of protecting the population it seems anything went. So even before all the sham monitoring procedures and reviews which Del and his team dismantle in forensic detail we are left with the proposition that none of the present products being given to US children – and frequently other children across most of the developed world – have any meaningful pre-marketing safety data all. If you are believer in the program you have been let down: if you wanted a program with any pretensions to safety - supposing such a thing to be possible - it looks like you would have to start from scratch. The manufacturers did this: the governments, the politicians and the regulators (internationally) let it happen.\nThis damning document is published simultaneously with a demand in the UK from the Royal Society for Public Health (which I had never heard of) to shut down comment about vaccines on the web. It echoes calls from Seth Berkley of GAVI, Heidi Larson of the Vaccine Confidence Project and the European Parliament. The pamphlet airily dismisses concerns that vaccines have side effects or that you could possibly have too many. It is pure public relations, and if the RSPH claims to be \"independent\" it also admits that the publication was paid for by Merck, a detail which was reported by British Medical Journal and the Guardian, but not true to form by the BBC. We have, in truth, been building to this moment for two decades: as the evidence piles up that every single aspect of the program lacks integrity or is simply rotten to the core all the perpetrators can do is call for the silencing of their critics, and maintain the products are safe because they say so.\nPlease help give the ICAN letter the widest possible distribution, particularly to politicians.\n\"The outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system.\"\nNope. This makes no sense. Lots of people who seemed vibrant will get a very severe case of the same illness that a vulnerable baby overcomes in a day.\nAnd under the germ theory it doesn't matter how strong your immune system *was*. Once it's been overcome by the pathogen it is every bit as weak as anybody else's with that pathogen.\nWhat you say makes no sense. There's no reason for me to reply to you again.\n\"Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared?\"\nWhy do you keep asking this question when I've already provided the answer hundreds of times? Why are you so desperate to believe the people who you already recognize are harming our children?\nWhy would Walter Reed be any more trustworthy than Paul Offit or Senator Pan? Why would Jenner or Pasteur?\nAnd you went no way to explaining my arguments against germ theory. If we are attacked by billions of viruses every day then if even a tiny fraction of them are pathogenic then we couldn't possibly survive. And even if we could, we would already be immune rendering every vaccine pointless. Once we had survived our first few days on earth, then we could never get sick again.\nIf that's wrong then we must conclude that precisely 0% of germs are pathogenic.\nPlus your comment about the immune system completely misunderstood my point. The immune system does not allow us to overcome our math problem. In fact, it makes it worse.\nYou did provide one solitary example of a patient with what are presumably yellow fever symptoms but you didn't say whether they had been given any toxic medical treatments.\nAnd like I said before, the whole \"incubation period\" is more than a little suspicious. Clearly they never found what they thought they would and just rigged the results to tell them what they want to hear.\nLike every other germ theorist/vaccine promoter in history.\nMany kinds of bacteria are constantly evolving and changing, like flu viruses. Others are more stable over time, like the yellow fever virus. Those that change develop new ways of infiltrating the cells of the organism being attacked (from our point of view, from its unconscious point of view, it's just carrying out its need to replicate, which it can only do inside the cells of its host). The changes which allow it to better infiltrate are more successful and result in more viruses with those traits.\nOur immune system is designed to detect and destroy potentially dangerous invading pathogens. Many bacteria are usually harmless and absolutely necessary. The minority are dangerous, and most people's immune systems do a good job of analyzing them and killing them, often with no signs of disease. Others experience a clinical infection, and the immune system usually mounts a successful attack on them.\nThe outcome of disease always depends both on the virulence of the pathogen and the health of the individual immune system. Vaccines are usually effective in giving immunity to the targeted diseases. They also have many dangers which everyone should be aware of, and vaccines should be avoided whenever possible. But in the case of the most dangerous diseases, everyone should learn about them and think about what he wants to do to protect himself and his children from them, considering all the factors involved. And no one can have 100% certainty that he has made the right decision, but that's life. But if you live in the Congo and many people around you are currently dying of yellow fever, then that means that you yourself are at risk of being bitten by a loaded mosquito and getting, often dying, of yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is very effective at preventing yellow fever. From there, each person must make a choice.\nAt the end of this stage there is a remission of two or three days. About 80% of those with clinical disease recover at this point, with permanent immunity. The other 20% enter the toxic stage, with a return of the fever, black vomit (coffee-ground emesis), diarrhea, a slowing of the pulse (Faget's sign), jaundice, yellow eyes, yellow skin, and failure of the kidneys, liver, and heart. The patient gets a strange hiccup (like with Ebola, a related disease), falls into a coma, and dies. About half of those patients who enter the toxic stage dies, even now, even with the best of hospital care. The Faget's sign can also occur at the end of the first stage.\nYou asked specifically about the symptoms of the Americans on Dr. Reed's team who got yellow fever in Cuba in 1900. I'll give the passage from The American Plague (162-5), which describes the course of Jesse Lazear's illness. \"In his logbook, Lazear wrote an unusual entry on September 13. In all cases before those, page after page of records, Lazear had used the soldier's name and simply the date he was bitten, with no other attention to the mosquito. A one-line entry with a name and a date. On that day, however, in his elegant hand, Lazear did not write the soldier's name, but instead wrote 'Guinea Pig No. 1.' He went on to write that this guinea pig had been bitten by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that developed from an egg laid by a mosquito that fed on a number of yellow fever cases: Suarez, Hernández, De Long, Ferández. It was a precise, detailed history that proved beyond doubt that the mosquito was loaded with the virus when it bit a healthy soldier...(If he had entered his name, then his death would have been considered medical suicide by the insurance company, and his wife and two children would not have gotten any payment.) For the next few days, Lazear's life continued much as it had over the last few months in Cuba. He fed and cared for the mosquitoes in the lab. ..Then he began to lose his appetite. He skipped a few meals in the mess hall. He didn't mention it to anyone, nor did he ask to see one of the yellow fever doctors; instead, he worked hard in the lab trying to ignore the oncoming headache.\n\"On September 18, he complained of feeling 'out of sorts,' and stayed in his officer's quarters. His head pounded and L. decided to write a letter. ..(he wrote to his mother, and referred to his one-year old son Houston and the baby his wife Mabel was about to have: they were staying with his mother in the US). ..That night, L. started to feel chilled as the fever came on. He never went to sleep but worked at his desk all through the night, trying to get all the information about the mosquitoes organized. By morning, he showed all the signs of a severe attack of yellow fever. The camp doctors made the diagnosis, and L. agreed to go to the yellow fever ward. ..L. was carried by litter out of the two-room, white pine board house in which he had lived since he and Mabel first arrived in Cuba. ..(In the yellow fever ward, in a separate one-room building), Lena Warner (the immune nurse who had survived the yellow fever in 1878, when she was nine, and was found in her boarded-up house by a former slave who first thought she was dead, and carried her to safety) nursed J.L., recording his vitals. (I put up a link to his case record and vital signs last week. The surgeon general required that this record be made for every yellow fever patient.)... (On September 25,) Lena Warner braced L's arms with all of her weight, shouting for help. Still he bolted from the bed, darting around the small frame-wood room as wildly as a trapped insect beating against glass. Two soldiers ran into the ward, pinning L to his bed, tying restraints around his wrists and elbows. ..Warner sponged his body with iced whiskey and water. She recorded his temperature, which had held at 104 degrees for days, on the chart beside his bed. ..(Warner watched him sleep.) But the quiet did not last. L's body began to lurch, and black vomit rolled from his mouth; through the bar hanging above his hospital cot. He writhed in the bed, and his skin grew deep yellow. His 104 temperature slowly fell, leveling out 99 degrees, and JL died at 8:45 p.m. at the age of thirty-four.\"\nAs is obvious, there are many problems with vaccines. But, that being said, most of them usually work for a period of time to prevent the targeted diseases. The basic science behind vaccines is correct. Why do you think that within a few years (not many) of the introduction of the vaccines for them, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, Hib disease, and chickenpox (and others) almost entirely disappeared? In the case of the routine childhood diseases, this was a bad thing, but it is a true thing.\nVaccines usually don't cause any obvious reactions. While they usually prevent the diseases, and that's why people continue to get them. With the increasing vaccination schedule, more and more are severely and permanently damaged, and it is immoral to mandate any vaccine for anyone for this reason. But it would also be immoral to prohibit vaccines for those who want them enough to take the risk.\nYour article said as though it had any probative value that 90% of those who get pertussis had been vaxxed. The old DPT vaccine was MUCH more effective at preventing pertussis, but it was so dangerous (again, not to most, but to many), that developed countries replaced it with the acellular version, DTaP. From the beginning about twenty years ago, it was clear that it was not very effective and that huge numbers of vaxxed people got pertussis anyway, including my daughter who got pertussis at eight month old after having gotten three DTaPs. The pertussis vaccine continues to be very dangerous, and I do not recommend that anyone get it. It used to be a killer disease, but evolved to become much milder, to the extent that the disease is very rarely dangerous (usually only to newborns under three months old), while the vaccine is very dangerous. And they're trying to see how they can go back to the old DPT. This does not show that vaccine science has collapsed, but rather that the vaccine they developed to replace the DPT turned out to be much less effective than they first thought, while continuing to be much more dangerous than they first thought.\nYour article extrapolated from that that modern medical science in general has collapsed, but that, again, is going too far. A older woman in Mexico City who is like my mother to me had a pacemaker inserted about two months ago to aid her failing heart, and it has restored her to optimism and energy, when she was despondent, weak, and close to death. I took my daughter to the dentist yesterday, who said she has three wisdom teeth coming in and that she said that the lower right one was sore. So, although I am cautious about X-rays, I made an appointment for a panoramic X-ray in a month to assess the wisdom teeth, and, if it seems appropriate, I'll take her to an oral surgeon to have one or more extracted under IV sedation, in his office, if possible (the dentist thought that it would be). And I am confident that there will be no serious problems, but this is thanks to technology and training in modern medicine that haven't been available for that long.\nI think that everyone should inform himself on all medical procedures before agreeing to anything, but I also think that he should have access to any medical procedure which is reasonable (and opinions can differ as to that).\nOne problem is that you have not said how you think people should protect themselves against tetanus, bacterial meningitis, and yellow fever in the relevant cases, for example. These are diseases which healthy, well-nourished people used to die from very readily.\nIf most people stopped vaxxing and the mortality from these diseases rose to something like pre-vaccine levels, do you think they should just accept dying from them?\nI put that in a separate paragraph because it is the crucial issue.\nbalinaheuchter Air Traffic Control You Tube - Colin Campbell example of - How to \"Fudge a Nudge\" -\"Deal\" or \"No Deal\" \"Not in a month of Sundays\" \"No exceptions/no compromise?\" -make a trade off -do an exception- everyone get's a good deal /good outcome!\nHans, you are right that we are looking at one of the biggest crimes in all history. When I read the story of that poor girl who was so healthy and is now confined to a wheelchair after getting her third Gardasil shot I could not believe that Merck could produce such a toxic vaccine and give it out to girls like it was something they absolutely had to have only to be mislead and made into cripples. Merck should be prosecuted for the damage they have done to so many girls who got the Gardasil vaccine and were physically debilitated for life. There is a place for the people who perpetrated this crime on young girls and women and it is called hell. They have destroyed people's lives and gotten away with it. My heart goes out to those who have suffered this damage for no damn good reason except to help make huge profits for Merck!\nHere is the reason that the germ theory is nonsense.\n1) Everyday we are bombarded with billions of germs. Presumably at least some of them are of the kind that germ theorists believe are dangerous (otherwise we would have to conclude that none of them are dangerous). So how do we survive?\n2) Let's just say that we ignore 1 and imagine that, by way of magic, none of the billions of viruses we get bombarded with are pathogenic but all those that are are tucked away somewhere. Ok. But presumably they reside in sick people right? So where are there lots of sick people? Doctor offices and hospitals! So everybody must be dying the moment they enter these places right?\n3) I love this one because I have never seen anybody else ever raise it. Under the germ theory there are no negative feedbacks. This makes a stable biological system by definition impossible. The immune system is *not* a negative feedback it is the opposite. It actually reinforces our math problem because the immune system will weaken as the number of pathogens increase.\nThere is no way of resolving this problem without a discontinuity. A Deus ex Machina as The Almighty Pill so beautifully put it. So the germ theory is quite literally, mathematically impossible.\nThere is as much chance of it being true as 2+2 = 5.\nThere are plenty of other massive problems with germ theory such as why did things like SARS and bird flu magically disappear? Why do we have the symptoms that we do? Is our body controlling the symptoms to help fight the germs and if so, why would suppressing the symptoms with antibiotics or Tamiflu be considered a good idea? If the virus is causing the symptoms then why would it cause these kinds of things?", "answers": ["Del Bigtree and his team at ICAN."], "length": 3150, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "751053416f74a11311a13e801634fff8fd48649d3921b368"}
{"input": "What was the conclusion of the study?", "context": "consumption influences mercury: Topics by WorldWideScience.org\nSample records for consumption influences mercury\nEpidemiologic confirmation that fruit consumption influences mercury exposure in riparian communities in the Brazilian Amazon\nSousa Passos, Carlos Jose; Mergler, Donna; Fillion, Myriam; Lemire, Melanie; Mertens, Frederic; Guimaraes, Jean Remy Davee; Philibert, Aline\nSince deforestation has recently been associated with increased mercury load in the Amazon, the problem of mercury exposure is now much more widespread than initially thought. A previous exploratory study suggested that fruit consumption may reduce mercury exposure. The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fruit consumption on the relation between fish consumption and bioindicators of mercury (Hg) exposure in Amazonian fish-eating communities. A cross-sectional dietary survey based on a 7-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency was conducted within 13 riparian communities from the Tapajos River, Brazilian Amazon. Hair samples were collected from 449 persons, and blood samples were collected from a subset of 225, for total and inorganic mercury determination by atomic absorption spectrometry. On average, participants consumed 6.6 fish meals/week and ate 11 fruits/week. The average blood Hg (BHg) was 57.1Â±36.3 Î¼g/L (median: 55.1 Î¼g/L), and the average hair-Hg (HHg) was 16.8Â±10.3 Î¼g/g (median: 15.7 Î¼g/g). There was a positive relation between fish consumption and BHg (r=0.48; P 2 =36.0%) and HHg levels (fish: Î²=1.2, P 2 =21.0%). ANCOVA models showed that for the same number of fish meals, persons consuming fruits more frequently had significantly lower blood and HHg concentrations. For low fruit consumers, each fish meal contributed 9.8 Î¼g/L Hg increase in blood compared to only 3.3 Î¼g/L Hg increase for the high fruit consumers. In conclusion, fruit consumption may provide a protective effect for Hg exposure in Amazonian riparians. Prevention strategies that seek to maintain fish consumption while reducing Hg exposure in fish-eating communities should be pursued\nInfluence of mercury bioaccessibility on exposure assessment associated with consumption of cooked predatory fish in Spain.\nTorres-Escribano, Silvia; Ruiz, Antonio; Barrios, Laura; VÃ©lez, Dinoraz; Montoro, Rosa\nPredatory fish tend to accumulate high levels of mercury (Hg). Food safety assessment of these fish has been carried out on the raw product. However, the evaluation of the risk from Hg concentrations in raw fish might be modified if cooking and bioaccessibility (the contaminant fraction that solubilises from its matrix during gastrointestinal digestion and becomes available for intestinal absorption) were taken into account. Data on Hg bioaccessibility in raw predatory fish sold in Spain are scarce and no research on Hg bioaccessibility in cooked fish is available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate Hg bioaccessibility in various kinds of cooked predatory fish sold in Spain to estimate their health risk. Both Hg and bioaccessible Hg concentrations were analysed in raw and cooked fish (swordfish, tope shark, bonito and tuna). There were no changes in Hg concentrations during cooking. However, Hg bioaccessibility decreased significantly after cooking (42 Â± 26% in raw fish and 26 Â± 16% in cooked fish), thus reducing in swordfish and tope shark the Hg concentration to which the human organism would be exposed.

In this study, hair samples collected from fishermen and their families, and commercial marine fishes were analyzed for mercury and methylmercury by neutron activation and gas chromatography. The results showed a correlation between hair mercury levels and fish consumption patterns. The levels of mercury found in this study were similar to those reported by other workers for fish consuming population groups worldwide. (author)\nFish consumption limit for mercury compounds\nAbbas Esmaili-Sari\nFull Text Available Background and objectives: Methyl mercury can carry out harmful effects on the reproductive, respiratory, and nervous system of human. Moreover, mercury is known as the most toxic heavy metal in nature. Fish and seafood consumption is the major MeHg exposure route for human. The present study tries to cover researches which have been conducted on mercury levels in 21 species of fish from Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea and Anzali Wetland during the past 6 years, and in addition to stating mercury level, it provides recommendations about the restriction of monthly fish consumption for each species separately. Material and methods: Fish samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored in refrigerator under -20oC until they were dissected. Afterwards, the muscle tissues were separated and dried. The dried samples were ground and changed into a homogenous powder and then the mercury concentration rate has been determined by advanced mercury analyzer, model 254. Results: In general, mercury contamination in fishes caught from Anzali Wetland was much more than fishes from Caspian Sea. Also, from among all studied fishes, oriental sole (Euryglossa orientalis, caught from Persian Gulf, allocated the most mercury level to itself with the rate of 5.61ml per kg., therefore, it exercises a severe consumption restriction for pregnant women and vulnerable groups. Conclusion: Based on the calculations, about 50% of fishes, mostly with short food chain, can be easily consumed during the year. However, with regard to Oriental sole (Euryglossa orientalis and shark (Carcharhinus dussumieri, caught from Persian Gulf, special consideration should be taken in their consumption. On the other hand, careful planning should be made for the high rate of fish consumption among fishing community.\nHair Mercury Concentrations and Fish Consumption Patterns in Florida Residents\nAdam M. Schaefer\nFull Text Available Mercury exposure through the consumption of fish and shellfish represents a significant public health concern in the United States. Recent research has demonstrated higher seafood consumption and subsequent increased risk of methylmercury exposure among subpopulations living in coastal areas. The identification of high concentrations of total mercury in blood and skin among resident Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL, a coastal estuary in Florida, alerted us to a potential public health hazard in the contiguous human population. Therefore, we analyzed hair mercury concentrations of residents living along the IRL and ascertained their sources and patterns of seafood consumption. The total mean mercury concentration for 135 residents was 1.53 Â± 1.89 Âµg/g. The concentration of hair mercury among males (2.02 Â± 2.38 Âµg/g was significantly higher than that for females (0.96 Â± 0.74 Âµg/g (p < 0.01. Log transformed hair mercury concentration was significantly associated with the frequency of total seafood consumption (p < 0.01. Individuals who reported consuming seafood once a day or more were 3.71 (95% CI 0.84â€“16.38 times more likely to have a total hair mercury concentration over 1.0 Âµg/g, which corresponds approximately to the U.S. EPA reference dose, compared to those who consumed seafood once a week or less. Hair mercury concentration was also significantly higher among individuals who obtained all or most of their seafood from local recreational sources (p < 0.01. The elevated human mercury concentrations mirror the elevated concentrations observed in resident dolphins in the same geographical region. The current study is one of the first to apply the concept of a sentinel animal to a contiguous human population.\nFish consumption and bioindicators of inorganic mercury exposure\nSousa Passos, Carlos Jose; Mergler, Donna; Lemire, Melanie; Fillion, Myriam; Guimaraes, Jean Remy Davee\nBackground: The direct and close relationship between fish consumption and blood and hair mercury (Hg) levels is well known, but the influence of fish consumption on inorganic mercury in blood (B-IHg) and in urine (U-Hg) is unclear. Objective: Examine the relationship between fish consumption, total, inorganic and organic blood Hg levels and urinary Hg concentration. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on 171 persons from 7 riparian communities on the Tapajos River (Brazilian Amazon), with no history of inorganic Hg exposure from occupation or dental amalgams. During the rising water season in 2004, participants responded to a dietary survey, based on a seven-day recall of fish and fruit consumption frequency, and socio-demographic information was recorded. Blood and urine samples were collected. Total, organic and inorganic Hg in blood as well as U-Hg were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Results: On average, participants consumed 7.4 fish meals/week and 8.8 fruits/week. Blood total Hg averaged 38.6 Â± 21.7 Î¼g/L, and the average percentage of B-IHg was 13.8%. Average organic Hg (MeHg) was 33.6 Â± 19.4 Î¼g/L, B-IHg was 5.0 Â± 2.6 Î¼g/L, while average U-Hg was 7.5 Â± 6.9 Î¼g/L, with 19.9% of participants presenting U-Hg levels above 10 Î¼g/L. B-IHg was highly significantly related to the number of meals of carnivorous fish, but no relation was observed with non-carnivorous fish; it was negatively related to fruit consumption, increased with age, was higher among those who were born in the Tapajos region, and varied with community. U-Hg was also significantly related to carnivorous but not non-carnivorous fish consumption, showed a tendency towards a negative relation with fruit consumption, was higher among men compared to women and higher among those born in the region. U-Hg was strongly related to I-Hg, blood methyl Hg (B-MeHg) and blood total Hg (B-THg). The Odds Ratio (OR) for U-Hg above 10 Î¼g/L for those who ate > 4 carnivorous fish\nMethyl mercury exposure in Swedish women with high fish consumption\nBjoernberg, Karolin Ask [Division of Metals and Health, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Box 210, SE-171 77, Stockholm (Sweden); Vahter, Marie [Division of Metals and Health, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Box 210, SE-171 77, Stockholm (Sweden); Grawe, Kierstin Petersson [Toxicology Division, National Food Administration, Box 622, SE-751 26 Uppsala (Sweden); Berglund, Marika [Division of Metals and Health, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Box 210, SE-171 77, Stockholm (Sweden)]. E-mail: Marika.Berglund@imm.ki.se\nWe studied the exposure to methyl mercury (MeHg) in 127 Swedish women of childbearing age with high consumption of various types of fish, using total mercury (T-Hg) in hair and MeHg in blood as biomarkers. Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), including detailed information about consumption of different fish species, reflecting average intake during 1 year. We also determined inorganic mercury (I-Hg) in blood, and selenium (Se) in serum. The average total fish consumption, as reported in the food frequency questionnaire, was approximately 4 times/week (range 1.6-19 times/week). Fish species potentially high in MeHg, included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 79% of the women. About 10% consumed such species more than once a week, i.e., more than what is recommended. Other fish species potentially high in MeHg, not included in the Swedish dietary advisories, was consumed by 54% of the women. Eleven percent never consumed fish species potentially high in MeHg. T-Hg in hair (median 0.70 mg/kg; range 0.08-6.6 mg/kg) was associated with MeHg in blood (median 1.7 {mu}g/L; range 0.30-14 {mu}g/L; r {sub s}=0.78; p<0.001). Hair T-Hg, blood MeHg and serum Se (median 70 {mu}g/L; range 46-154 {mu}g/L) increased with increasing total fish consumption (r {sub s}=0.32; p<0.001, r {sub s}=0.37; p<0.001 and r {sub s}=0.35; p=0.002, respectively). I-Hg in blood (median 0.24 {mu}g/L; range 0.01-1.6 {mu}g/L) increased with increasing number of dental amalgam fillings. We found no statistical significant associations between the various mercury species measured and the Se concentration in serum. Hair mercury levels exceeded the levels corresponding to the EPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.1 {mu}g MeHg/kg b.w. per day in 20% of the women. Thus, there seems to be no margin of safety for neurodevelopmental effects in fetus, for women with high fish consumption unless they decrease their intake of certain fish species.\nBjoernberg, Karolin Ask; Vahter, Marie; Grawe, Kierstin Petersson; Berglund, Marika\nWe studied the exposure to methyl mercury (MeHg) in 127 Swedish women of childbearing age with high consumption of various types of fish, using total mercury (T-Hg) in hair and MeHg in blood as biomarkers.

Objectives: We examined relationships between fish consumption, estimated mercury (Hg) intake......, and measured Hg exposure among one such potentially highly-exposed group, recreational anglers in Louisiana USA. Methods: We surveyed 534 anglers in 2006 using interviews at boat launches and fishing tournaments combined with an internet-based survey method. Hair samples from 402 of these anglers were...... collected and analyzed for total Hg. Questionnaires provided information on species-specific fish consumption over 3 months prior to the survey. Results: Anglers' median hair-Hg concentration was 0.81 Âµg/g (n=398; range: 0.02-10.7 Âµg/g), with 40% of participants above 1 Âµg/g, the level that approximately...\nUmbilical cord blood and placental mercury, selenium and selenoprotein expression in relation to maternal fish consumption\nGilman, Christy L.; Soon, Reni; Sauvage, Lynnae; Ralston, Nicholas V.C.; Berry, Marla J.\nSeafood is an important source of nutrients for fetal neurodevelopment. Most individuals are exposed to the toxic element mercury through seafood. Due to the neurotoxic effects of mercury, United States government agencies recommend no more than 340 g (12 oz) per week of seafood consumption during pregnancy. However, recent studies have shown that selenium, also abundant in seafood, can have protective effects against mercury toxicity. In this study, we analyzed mercury and selenium levels an...\nFactors that negatively influence consumption of traditionally ...\nFactors that negatively influence consumption of traditionally fermented milk ... in various countries of sub-Saharan Africa and a number of health benefits to human ... influence consumption of Mursik, a traditionally fermented milk product fromÂ ...\nMercury exposure as a function of fish consumption in two Asian communities in coastal Virginia, USA.\nXu, Xiaoyu; Newman, Michael C\nFish consumption and associated mercury exposure were explored for two Asian-dominated church communities in coastal Virginia and compared with that of two non-Asian church communities. Seafood-consumption rates for the Chinese (36.9Â g/person/day) and Vietnamese (52.7Â g/person/day) church communities were greater than the general United States fish-consumption rate (12.8Â g/person/day). Correspondingly, hair mercury concentrations for people from the Chinese (0.52Â Âµg/g) and the Vietnamese church (1.46Â Âµg/g) were greater than the overall level for United States women (0.20Â Âµg/g) but lower than the published World Health Organization exposure threshold (14Â Âµg/g). A conventional regression model indicated a positive relationship between seafood consumption rates and hair mercury concentrations suggesting the importance of mercury exposure through seafood consumption. The annual-average daily methylmercury intake rate for the studied communities calculated by Monte Carlo simulations followed the sequence: Vietnamese communityÂ >Â Chinese communityÂ >Â non-Asian communities. Regardless, their daily methylmercury intake rates were all lower than the United States Environmental Protection Agency reference dose of 0.1Â Âµg/kg body weight-day. In conclusion, fish-consumption patterns differed among communities, which resulted in different levels of mercury exposure. The greater seafood and mercury ingestion rates of studied Asian groups compared with non-Asian groups suggest the need for specific seafood consumption advice for ethnic communities in the United States. Otherwise the health benefits from fish consumption could be perceived as trivial compared with the ill-defined risk of mercury exposure.\nFeather growth influences blood mercury level of young songbirds.\nCondon, Anne M; Cristol, Daniel A\nDynamics of mercury in feathers and blood of free-living songbirds is poorly understood. Nestling eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) living along the mercury-contaminated South River (Virginia, USA) had blood mercury levels an order of magnitude lower than their parents (nestling: 0.09 +/- 0.06 mg/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], n = 156; adult: 1.21 +/- 0.57 mg/kg, n = 86). To test whether this low blood mercury was the result of mercury sequestration in rapidly growing feathers, we repeatedly sampled free-living juveniles throughout the period of feather growth and molt. Mean blood mercury concentrations increased to 0.52 +/- 0.36 mg/kg (n = 44) after the completion of feather growth. Some individuals had reached adult blood mercury levels within three months of leaving the nest, but levels dropped to 0.20 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (n = 11) once the autumn molt had begun. Most studies of mercury contamination in juvenile birds have focused on recently hatched young with thousands of rapidly growing feathers. However, the highest risk period for mercury intoxication in young birds may be during the vulnerable period after fledging, when feathers no longer serve as a buffer against dietary mercury. We found that nestling blood mercury levels were not indicative of the extent of contamination because a large portion of the ingested mercury ended up in feathers. The present study demonstrates unequivocally that in songbirds blood mercury level is influenced strongly by the growth and molt of feathers.\nHigh mercury seafood consumption associated with fatigue at specialty medical clinics on Long Island, NY\nShivam Kothari\nFull Text Available We investigated the association between seafood consumption and symptoms related to potential mercury toxicity in patients presenting to specialty medical clinics at Stony Brook Medical Center on Long Island, New York. We surveyed 118 patients from Aprilâ€“August 2012 about their seafood consumption patterns, specifically how frequently they were eating each type of fish, to assess mercury exposure. We also asked about symptoms associated with mercury toxicity including depression, fatigue, balance difficulties, or tingling around the mouth. Of the 118 adults surveyed, 14 consumed high mercury seafood (tuna steak, marlin, swordfish, or shark at least weekly. This group was more likely to suffer from fatigue than other patients (pÂ =Â 0.02. Logistic regression confirmed this association of fatigue with frequent high mercury fish consumption in both unadjusted analysis (ORÂ =Â 5.53; 95% CI: 1.40â€“21.90 and analysis adjusted for age, race, sex, income, and clinic type (ORÂ =Â 7.89; 95% CI: 1.63â€“38.15. No associations were observed between fish intake and depression, balance difficulties, or tingling around the mouth. Findings suggest that fatigue may be associated with eating high mercury fish but sample size is small.

{"input": "What happens to Ngotho after he attacks Jacobo at a workers' strike?", "context": "Weep Not, Child is a 1964 novel by Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o. It was his first novel, published in 1964 under the name James Ngugi. It was among the African Writers Series. It was the first English language|English novel to be published by an East African. Thiong'o's works deal with the relationship between Africans and white settlers in colonial Kenya, and are heavily critical of colonial rule. Specifically, Weep Not, Child deals with the Mau Mau Uprising, and \"the bewildering dispossession of an entire people from their ancestral land.\" Ngũgĩ wrote the novel while he was a student at Makerere University.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts and eighteen chapters. Part one deals mostly with the education of Njoroge, while part two deals with the rising Mau Mau movement.\n\nPlot summary\n\nNjoroge, a little boy, is urged to attend school by his mother. He is the first one of his family able to go to school. His family lives on the land of Jacobo, an African made rich by his dealings with white settlers, namely Mr. Howlands, the most powerful land owner in the area. Njoroge's brother Kamau works as an apprentice to a carpenter, while Boro, the eldest living son, is troubled by his experiences while in forced service during World War II, including witnessing the death of his elder brother. Ngotho, Njoroge's father and a respected man in the surrounding area, tends Mr. Howlands' crops, but is motivated by his passion to preserve his ancestral land, rather than for any compensation or loyalty.\n\nOne day, black workers call for a strike to obtain higher wages. Ngotho is ambivalent about participating in the strike because he fears he will lose his job. However, he decides to go to the gathering, even though his two wives do not agree. At the demonstration, there are calls for higher wages. Suddenly, the white police inspector brings Jacobo to the gathering to pacify the native people. Jacobo tries to put an end to the strike. Ngotho attacks Jacobo, and the result is a riot where two people are killed. Jacobo survives and swears revenge. Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge’s family is forced to move. Njoroge’s brothers fund his education and seem to lose respect for their father.\n\nMwihaki, Jacobo's daughter and Njoroge's best friend, enters a girls' only boarding school, leaving Njoroge relatively alone. He reflects upon her leaving, and realizes that he was embarrassed by his father's actions towards Jacobo. For this reason, Njoroge is not upset by her exit and their separation. Njoroge switches to another school.\n\nFor a time, everyone's attention is focused on the upcoming trial of Jomo Kenyatta – a revered leader of the movement. Many blacks think that he is going to bring forth Kenya’s independence. But Jomo loses the trial and is imprisoned. This results in further protests and greater suppression of the black population.\n\nJacobo and a white landowner, Mr. Howlands, fight against the rising activities of the Mau Mau, an organization striving for Kenyan economic, political, and cultural independence. Jacobo accuses Ngotho of being the leader of the Mau Mau and tries to imprison the whole family. Meanwhile, the situation in the country is deteriorating. Six black men are taken out of their houses and executed in the woods.\n\nOne day Njoroge meets Mwihaki again, who has returned from boarding school. Although Njoroge had planned to avoid her due to the conflict between their fathers, their friendship is unaffected. Njoroge passes an important exam that allows him to advance to High School. His village is proud of him, and collects money to pay Njoroge's High School tuition.\n\nSeveral months later, Jacobo is murdered in his office by a member of the Mau Mau. Mr. Howlands has Njoroge removed from school for questioning. Both father and son are brutally beaten before release and Ngotho is left barely alive. Although there doesn't seem to be a connection between Njoroge's family and the murder, it is eventually revealed that Njoroge's brothers are behind the assassination, and that Boro is the real leader of the Mau Mau. Ngotho soon dies from his injuries and Njoroge finds out that his father was protecting his brothers. Kamau has been imprisoned for life. Only Njoroge and his two mothers remain free, and Njoroge is left as the sole provider of his two mothers. Njoroge fears that he cannot make ends meet; he gives up hope of continuing in school and loses faith in God.\n\nNjoroge asks Mwihaki's for support, but she is angry because of her father’s death. When he finally pledges his love to her, she refuses to leave with him, realizing her obligation to Kenya and her mother. Njoroge decides to leave town and makes an attempt at suicide; however, he fails when his mothers find him before he is able to hang himself. The novel closes with Njoroge feeling hopeless, and ashamed of cowardice.\n\nCharacters in Weep Not, Child\n Njoroge: the main character of the book whose main goal throughout the book is to become as educated as possible.\n Ngotho: Njoroge's father. He works for Mr.Howlands and is respected by him until he attacks Jacobo at a workers strike. He is fired and the family is forced to move to another section of the country. Over the course of the book his position as the central power of the family weakened, to the point where his self-realization that he has spent his whole life waiting for the prophecy (that proclaims the blacks will be returned their land) to come true rather than fighting for Kenyan independence, leads to his depression.\n Nyokabi and Njeri: the two wives of Ngotho. Njeri is Ngotho's first wife, and mother of Boro, Kamau, and Kori. Nyokabi is his second wife, and the mother of Njoroge and Mwangi.\n Njoroge has four brothers: Boro, Kamau, Kori and Mwangi (who is Njoroge's only full brother, who died in World War II).\n Boro: Son of Njeri who fights for the Allies in World War II. Upon returning his anger against the colonial government is compounded by their confiscation of the his land. Boro's anger and position as eldest son leads him to question and ridicule Ngotho, which eventually defeats their father's will (upon realizing his life was wasted waiting and not acting). It is eventually revealed that Boro is the leader of the Mau Mau (earlier alluded to as \"entering politics\") and murders Mr.Howlands. He is caught by police immediately after and is scheduled to be executed by the book's end. It is highly likely that it is also Boro who kills Jacobo.\n Mwihaki: Njoroge's best friend (and later develops into his love interest). Daughter of Jacobo. When it is revealed that his family killed Jacobo (most likely Boro), Mwihaki distances herself from Njoroge, asking for time to mourn her father and care for her mother.\n Jacobo: Mwihaki's father and an important landowner. Chief of the village.\n Mr. Howlands: A white settler who emigrated to colonial Kenya and now owns a farm made up of land that originally belonged to Ngotho's ancestors. Has three children: Peter who died in World War II before the book's beginning, a daughter who becomes a missionary, and Stephen who met Njoroge while the two were in high school.\n\nThemes and motifs\nWeep Not, Child integrates Gikuyu mythology and the ideology of nationalism that serves as catalyst for much of the novel's action. The novel explores the negative aspects of colonial rule over Kenya. Njoroge's aspiration to attend university is frustrated by both the violence of the Mau Mau rebels and the violent response of the colonial government. This disappointment leads to his alienation from his family and ultimately his suicide attempt.\n\nThe novel also ponders the role of saviours and salvation. The author notes in his The River Between: \"Salvation shall come from the hills. From the blood that flows in me, I say from the same tree, a son shall rise. And his duty shall be to lead and save the people.\" Jomo Kenyatta, the first prime minister of Kenya, is immortalised in Weep Not, Child. The author says, \"Jomo had been his (Ngotho's) hope. Ngotho had come to think that it was Jomo who would drive away the white man. To him, Jomo stood for custom and traditions purified by grace of learning and much travel.\" Njoroge comes to view Jomo as a messiah who will win the struggle against the colonial government.\n\nSee also\n\nThings Fall Apart\nDeath and the King's Horseman\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial homepage of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o\nBBC profile of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o\nWeep Not, Child at Google Books\n\nBritish Empire in fiction\nNovels set in colonial Africa\nHistorical novels\nKenyan English-language novels\nNovels by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o\nNovels set in Kenya\n1964 novels\nHeinemann (publisher) books\nPostcolonial novels\nAfrican Writers Series\n1964 debut novels", "answers": ["After attacking Jacobo at a workers' strike, Ngotho loses his job and Njoroge's family is forced to move."], "length": 1504, "dataset": "multifieldqa_en_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0ecdb8439f1360140995c6f5f6cc99c38cebb9216d1395e4"}
{"input": "When did KSTP switch to a sports radio format?", "context": "KSTP (1500 AM; SKOR North) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Saint Paul, Minnesota. It is the flagship AM radio station of Hubbard Broadcasting, which also owns several other television and radio stations across the United States.  KSTP has a sports radio format and is the ESPN Radio Network affiliate for Minneapolis-St. Paul.  The radio studios are  on University Avenue in Minneapolis, shared with sister stations KSTP-FM, KSTP-TV, KTMY, and KSTC-TV. On weekdays, KSTP airs local sports shows from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and carries ESPN programming weekday mornings, late nights and weekends. Some KSTP shows are simulcast on other sports radio stations in the region.\n\nKSTP runs the maximum power for AM stations, 50,000 watts.  It shares clear-channel, Class A status on 1500 AM with WFED in Washington, D.C.  KSTP broadcasts a directional signal at night, using a three-tower array, with its transmitter on U.S. Route 61 at Beam Avenue in Maplewood.  Programming is also heard on 250 watt FM translator K235BP at 94.9 MHz in Bemidji.\n\nHistory\n\nWAMD and KFOY\nKSTP's start in 1928 was the product of a merger between two pioneering Twin Cities stations: WAMD (\"Where All Minneapolis Dances\") in Minneapolis, first licensed on February 16, 1925 to Stanley E. Hubbard, and KFOY in St. Paul, first licensed on March 12, 1924 to the Beacon Radio Service in St. Paul.\n\nFollowing a few test transmissions, WAMD made its formal debut broadcast on February 22, 1925. (In later interviews Stanley Hubbard traced WAMD's start to April 1924.) It was located at the Marigold Dance Garden, and featured nightly \"Midnight Frolics\" broadcasts by the ballroom's orchestra. It is claimed that WAMD was the first radio station to be completely supported by running paid advertisements. Effective June 15, 1927, WAMD was assigned to 1330 kHz.\n\nOn November 11, 1927 WAMD's transmitter site at Oxboro Heath on Lyndale Avenue South burned down, two weeks after the station had been sold to the National Battery Company. An initial arrangement was made to carry WAMD's programs over WRHM (now WWTC), transmitting on WAMD's 1330 kHz frequency. Beginning on November 24, 1927 the WAMD broadcasts, still on 1330 kHz, were shifted to KFOY's facility in St. Paul. (At this time KFOY was assigned to 1050 kHz). The next day it was announced that National Battery had purchased KFOY, and as of December 1, 1927 both KFOY and WAMD were reassigned to 1350 kHz. WAMD continued making regular broadcasts until the end of March 1928, while KFOY, although it continued to be licensed for a few more months on a time-sharing basis with WAMD, ceased operations at this point.\n\nNational Battery Company\nIn mid-December 1927, the National Battery Company announced it had received permission from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to build a new station, with the call letters KSTP, operating from a transmitter site to be constructed three miles south of Wescott. The next month it was reported that the new station, still under construction, had been assigned to 1360 kHz. KSTP made its debut broadcast on March 29, 1928. Although technically it was a separate station from WAMD and KFOY, both of which were formally deleted on April 30, 1928, overall KSTP was treated as the direct successor to a consolidated WAMD and KFOY.\n\nHubbard became the merged station's general manager, acquiring controlling interest in 1941. A month after the merger, KSTP became an affiliate for the NBC Red Network.  It remained with NBC for 46 years. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the FRC's General Order 40, KSTP was assigned to a \"high-powered regional\" frequency of 1460 kHz. The only other station assigned to this frequency was WTFF in Mount Vernon Hills, Virginia (later WJSV, now WFED, Washington, D.C.). On February 7, 1933, the FRC authorized KSTP to increase its daytime power to 25 KW. In 1938 and 1939 KSTP also operated a high-fidelity AM \"experimental audio broadcasting station\" Apex station, W9XUP, originally on 25,950 kHz and later on 26,150 kHz. In 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, KSTP was assigned to its current \"clear channel\" frequency of 1500 kHz, with the provision that it and WJSV, as \"Class I-B\" stations, had to maintain directional antennas at night in order to mutually protect each other from interference. An FM station, KSTP-FM, was founded in 1946 but shut down in 1952.\n\nHubbard reportedly acquired an RCA TV camera in 1939, and started experimenting with television broadcasts.  But World War II put a hold on the development of television.  In 1948, with the war over, KSTP-TV became the first television station in Minnesota.  With KSTP 1500 already associated with NBC Radio, KSTP-TV became an NBC Television Network affiliate.  From 1946 to 1952, KSTP also had an FM counterpart.  KSTP-FM 102.1 was only on the air four years.  There were few radios equipped to receive FM signals in that era, and management decided to discontinue FM broadcasts.\n\nMOR and Top 40\nAs network programming moved from radio to television, KSTP programmed a full service Middle of the Road (MOR) radio format, in the shadow of its chief competitor, CBS Radio affilia
