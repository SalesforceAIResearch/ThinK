The largest case of fraud brought to the Department of Justice took place between 2007 until 2016.  Philip Esformes, 48, owner of more than 20 assisted living facilities and skilled nursing homes was the leader of the ring. Former Director of the Outreach Program at Larkin Hospital in South Miami, Odette Barcha, 50, was Esformes’ accomplice along with Arnaldo Carmouze, 57, a physical assistant in the Palmetto Bay Area. These three constructed a team of corrupt physicians, hospitals, and private practices in South Florida. The scheme worked as follows: bribes and kickbacks where paid to physicians, hospitals, and practices to refer patients to the facilities owned and controlled by Esformes. The assisted living and skilled nursing facilities would admit the patients and bill Medicare and Medicaid for unnecessary, fabricated and sometimes harmful procedures. In addition to that, some of the charges to Medicare and Medicaid include prescription narcotics prescribed to patients addicted to opioids to entice the patients to stay at the facility in order for the bill to increase. Another technique used by the dream team was to move patients in and out of facilities when the patients have reached the maximum number of days allowed by Medicare and Medicaid. This was accomplished by using one of the corrupt physicians to see the patients and coordinate for readmission in the same or a different facility owned by Esformes. Per Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, a patient is allowed 100 days at a skilled nursing facility after a hospital stay. The patient is given an additional 100 days if the he/she spends 6 days outside of a facility or is readmitted to a hospital for 3 additional days. The facilities not only fabricated medical documents to show treatment was done to a patient, they also hiked up the prices to equipment and medications that were never consumed or used.  The role of Barcha as the Director of the Outreach program was to expand the group of corrupt physicians and practices. She would advise the community physicians and hospitals to refer patients to the facilities owned by Esformes and they will receive monetary gifts. The group would refer patient to the facilities and receive kickbacks. The law against kickbacks is called the Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law. This law makes it illegal for medical providers to refer patient to a facility owned by the physician or a family member for services billable to Medicare and Medicaid. It also prohibits providers to receive bribes for patient referrals. The involvement of Carmouze in the grand scheme was to prescribe unnecessary prescription drug to patients who may or may not have needed the medications. He also facilitated community physicians to visit the patient in the assisted living facilities owned by Esformes in order for the physician to bill Medicare and Medicaid and Esformes received kickbacks. Carmouze also assisted in falsifying medical documentation to represent proof of medical necessity for many of the medications, procedures, visits, and equipment charged to the government. Esformes has been detained since 2016. In 2019, he was convicted for charges that add up to 20 years in prison.

Women and girls were an afterthought of a system designed for men. The authors explain that more recent research has shown how women's and girls' victimization narrows their choices and provide the background for their entrance into unemployment, prostitution or survival sex, drug use and abuse, homelessness and other criminal acts. The authors explain that girls' pathways to crime are further affected by the gendered nature of society. The authors also discuss the increased rates of women's and girls' imprisonment in the 21st century, and ask: \"What led these women into criminal behavior? Are today's women more violent than their counterparts in the past decades? How could such a change in public policy towards women (that led to their increased imprisonment) have happened with so little fanfare?\" They explain that society must stop punishing girls and women based on myths bolstered by bad information and instead seek recourse in the real causes of their offending. As well, the lack of civil rights guaranteed to youth makes their arrest possible and normal, in the case of girls, even when they are fleeing horrific situations. Chesney-Lind and Pasko explain that the answer to the last question, how could the dramatic increase in the prison population of women, lies in the societal anxiety that surrounds women and girl offenders. Furthermore, because the majority of people are arrested and imprisoned are poor and therefore without a voice and the authors argue to counter these challenges we must focus attention on girls and women offender, engage them as persons, listen to their story and ultimately turn the prisoner into a person. The authors claim that to fix these problems we could choose not to imprison marginalized girls and women, as we often do for white women and girls. They posit this would be unlikely to cause a surge in crime as most women and girls are in need of training, education and support, not punishment. They also suggest society should work to strengthen the bond between women, their communities and their children. The authors support their claims by showing that the increased imprisonment of women is not a result of new crimes and that decreases in the prison population would not only save taxpayers money but could be achieved through policy changes. The authors end the book by explaining that if society can begin to stop relying on imprisonment for women we can begin to consider this approach for men as well. They explain that the majority of male offenders are also marginalized by racism and poverty and furthermore, that they are the brothers, fathers and sons of marginalized women.", "answers": ["6"], "length": 3615, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "0358aa51ab38acc1b97405f4307203e982cbb19500435368"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Two years later, on 29 September 1977, another attempted launch of an Intelsat (Intelsat IVA F-5) communications satellite took place on AC-43.

Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it “to die” in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very physically well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before The Ascent, Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie Heat. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks. Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of The Ascent. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her capabilities throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To prevent hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them. With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.\n\nParagraph 4: The Académie Royale de Danse, founded by Letters Patent on the initiative of King Louis XIV of France in March 1661, was the first dance institution established in the Western world. As one of King Louis’ first official edicts after the death of royal adviser Jules Mazarin, the “Letters Patent of the King to Establish a Royal Academy of Dance in the City of Paris” represented a critical step towards the young King's wielding of consolidated personal power. Structurally, the Académie consisted of thirteen dancing masters selected by King Louis XIV for being the “most experienced in the Art [of dance].” This \"experience\" was determined by each dancer's history of success in previous royal productions of ballets de cour. Most famously, eight of the selected dancing masters performed with King Louis XIV during his portrayal of Apollo, the Sun King, in Le Ballet de la nuit (1653). Although the object of the Académie was to reflect, analyze and normalize matters of dance, no document relating to its activity or to this theorization has survived. The Académie Royale de Musique, founded in 1669 as the Académie d'Opéra, was a closely related opera and ballet company, and although the two institutions never merged, members of the dance academy were also associated with the opera. Little by little, recruitment of dancers into the royal entourage gave way to recruitment into the ballet-corps of the Opéra. This slowly altered the Académie's profile, making it and its members more dedicated to dance training alone. By 1775, the Académie was nearing the end of its life. On joining the Académie, Jean-Georges Noverre, one of ballet d’action’s most influential choreographers, commented on its ineffectiveness in making meaningful contributions to the dance world. But Noverre’s dismissive remarks concerning the organization cannot be taken at face value, since on a number of accounts, his statements are polemical, biased and misleading. It is often claimed that the Académie ceased to exist after 1778, merely because a list of the thirteen members was no longer published after this date, or alternatively after 1789, with the coming of French Revolution and the abolition or nationalization of royal institutions. In a tribute to his deceased brother Maximilien published in the  Courrier des spectacles  (30 September 1798), Pierre Gardel, the head choreographer at the Paris Opéra at that time, writes that “these positions, which came with a pension [of 500 livres], passed in turn to the most distinguished dancers. Citizens [Auguste] Vestris and [Pierre] Gardel, currently at the Théâtre de la République et des Arts, are the last to have enjoyed these.” It appears then that the Académie was indeed defunct by 1798. The opera and ballet company has survived and today is known as the Opéra National de Paris.\n\nParagraph 5: In the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained.

He has studied kickboxing, Seido-kaikan karate, and boxing. His nickname was \"Lights Out\" because of his high level karate and boxing skills, and one punch knock out power. He has won many world kickboxing titles, and reached as high as 10th in the highly respected World Boxing Council's & World Boxing Organisation's (W.B.C & WBO) Cruiserweight ratings. In 2000, he challenged WBO cruiserweight champion Johnny Nelson for his title. Watt holds the notable distinction of being the first athlete to fight for world Karate, kickboxing and boxing titles.\n\nParagraph 7: Television proved to be a hit, and within a year there were at least 53,194 television sets owned in the country, which equaled one for every 42 Puerto Ricans. Within two years, radio had experienced a sharp decline, with stations losing both advertisements and entertainers amidst the instability. Radio personalities complained that there were difficulties entering into the new medium, which had since created its own clique. Ramón Rivero continued to thrive in both mediums with his character of \"Diplo\". Ante la ley, the first Puerto Rican telenovela, was aired on August 22, 1955, by WKAQ-TV. WAPA-TV responded with Mar Brava, perpetuating the genre in local television for decades to come. Local radio technicians traveled abroad to become acquainted with the new technology, while foreign personnel also arrived to participate in the nascent industry. By 1956, the growing quantity of foreign entertainers coming to work in Puerto Rican television shows had caused an increasing anger in the local entertainers. During that year's summer, three shows produced by Tommy Muñiz held the top spots in the ratings. On April 29, 1959, El colegio de la alegría was revived at WAPA-TV, with its original cast and the addition of Velda González and Yoyo Boing. By early 1961, the amount of TV sets in Puerto Rico had increased to nearly 218,000 sets. This trend continued until Puerto Rico became the place with most television sets by square mile in Latin America and the Caribbean. Entering the 1960s, the prime-time slots were occupied by Myrta Silva's Una hora contigo and Rendezvous Nocturno hosted by Vilma Carbia and Tony Chiroldi. Foreigners such as Gaspar Pumarejo would replace this group. Meanwhile, WKAQ-TV only counted with El Show Libby's hosted by Luis Vigoreaux and El Show Ford hosted by Cordero as its local productions, with most being imported. By this time WKAQ, WAPA, WIPR and WKBM were based in San Juan, WRIK and WSUR at Ponce, WORA and WIPM at Mayagüez and WOLE at Aguadilla. WKBM-TV was founded by Rafael Pérez Perry, a radio entrepreneur. In February 1960, WKAQ debuted its videotape equipment, the first in Latin America. However, the complications that arose from using a costly new technology meant that most shows were still filmed live, with it becoming more popular for soap operas and commercials. WAPA, WIPR and WKBM introduced the technology as well and some years later it was predominant. By September 1956, however, the local channels had begun airing more kinescope, which were cheaper to air than a live production.\n\nParagraph 8: Two years later, on 29 September 1977, another attempted launch of an Intelsat (Intelsat IVA F-5) communications satellite took place on AC-43.

In the aftermath of the accident, NASA inspected their inventory of Atlas vehicles and found several more improperly brazed pipes which needed replacement.\n\nParagraph 9: During the Vietnam War, Nguyễn Văn Linh was the party secretary for the Vietcong in South Vietnam, which had seen him direct the guerrilla resistance against the American-allied government there, but most of his duties were organizational rather than military. He also specialised in propaganda, studying and attempting to influence American politics in favour of North Vietnam. He trained special undercover Vietcong spies who infiltrated government organisations in Saigon. In 1968, Linh directed the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam. This surprise attack throughout most South Vietnamese towns and cities was a turning point of the Vietnam War. After the end of the Vietnam War and the re-unification of Vietnam in 1975, Linh was inducted to the Communist Party's Politburo and became party chief of the capital Saigon. He favoured a slow transformation of the formerly capitalist southern part of the country causing him to come into conflict with his party colleagues. In the late 1970s, though considered a promising party politician, he had repeated arguments with Lê Duẩn, Ho Chi Minh's successor as party leader, preventing him from rising further in the hierarchy. In 1982, he was even removed from the Politburo. According to his friends, Linh resigned after an argument over the future of South Vietnam, in which he defended private capital.\n\nParagraph 10: In the harsh conditions in which the shoot took place, this factor was very important: extras and crew members were frostbitten, but no one complained. Shepitko herself did not ask for or require special treatment and her colleagues remembered her as an example of courage, faith, patience, and extraordinary care. For example, Boris Plotnikov was dressed very lightly and quickly grew numb from the cold and the piercing winds in the open field; but after the command \"Stop! Cut!\" the director came over to him to warm him up and to thank him. She also had to warm up Vladimir Gostyukhin who later wrote: \"It was worth it “to die” in the scene to be able to feel her gratitude.\" He said that almost no one knew what effort Shepitko gave when shooting each frame. Sometimes Gostyukhin had to carry the director from the car to the hotel room by himself: Shepitko was sometimes not very physically well and occasionally her strength weakened. Long before The Ascent, Shepitko became ill with hepatitis on the set of the movie Heat. Ignoring advice to go to Moscow, she went on to shoot the picture from a stretcher on which she was brought from the infectious barracks. Moreover, Shepitko did not recuperate enough, and the consequences of the disease adversely affected her well-being in the future, in particular on the set of The Ascent. In addition she experienced extreme pain which was caused by her recent spinal trauma. But Shepitko still rose two to three hours before the crew to have time to prepare, after which she worked to the maximum limit of her capabilities throughout the day. For example, in one long scene, the partisans are running away with difficulty through the thick snow from their pursuers. On screen it was necessary to show the deadly fatigue of the flushed, panting people. To prevent hypocrisy in the scenes, the director ran alongside the actors while filming, experiencing their exhausted state with them. With this dedication the shooting took place without interruption and was completed one month ahead of schedule.\n\nParagraph 11: After failing to envelop Hood's left flank at the Battle of Ezra Church, Sherman still wanted to extend his right flank to hit the railroad between East Point and Atlanta. He transferred Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield's XXIII Corps of the USA Army of the Ohio from his left to his right flank and sent him to the north bank of Utoy Creek. Although Schofield’s troops were at Utoy Creek on August 2, they, along with the XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, did not cross until August 4. An initial attack by the Regular Brigade against J. Patton Anderson's Division CSA of Stephen Dill Lee's Corps was unsuccessful.  In addition the Confederates dismounted a brigade of cavalry, Armstrong's, in the front of the federals in a deception plan, a feinted attack that was successful in delaying the combined force of the XXIII and XIV Corps USA.  Schofield made an additional movement to exploit this situation on the morning of August 5. Although initially successful, Schofield had to regroup his forces, which took the rest of the day. The delay allowed the Confederates to strengthen their defenses with an abatis, which slowed the Union attack when it restarted on the morning of August 6. The Federals were repulsed with heavy losses by William B. Bate's division and failed in an attempt to break the main defenses to gain the railroad. On August 7, the Union troops moved toward the Confederate main line skirmishing and extending to their right and entrenched. Several attacks were made at Sandtown Road (Campbellton at Adams Park) on 10 August and East Point on 18 August. Here US Forces remained, as far south as the Atlanta Christian College, until late August 1864 when the failure of Schofield's offensive operations convinced Sherman to move on the Confederate lines of communication and supply.\n\nParagraph 12: His first-team debut came as an 85th-minute substitute in the League Cup match against Rotherham United on 28 October 2003. During extra time he attempted to chip Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt, who handled the ball outside his penalty area and was sent off. With the score 1–1 after 120 minutes the game was decided in a penalty shootoutthe first ever shootout featuring Arsenal at Highburywhich Arsenal won, although Quincy missed his kick. He scored his first goal for the first team in the same competition on 9 November 2004 against Everton, a match in which he also made two assists, and contributed two appearances to Arsenal's victorious 2004–05 FA Cup campaign. He produced an impressive performance against Reading during the Gunners' 2005–06 League Cup run.\n\nParagraph 13: Born in Luxembourg City on 22 October 1965, Lentz grew up in the Luxembourg town of Echternach. He studied at the Luxembourg Conservatoire and later at the Paris Conservatoire (1982–1986) and the Musikhochschule Hannover (1986–1990). In 1989, he began working on a cycle of compositions titled Caeli enarrant.... His music is being recognised increasingly around the world, with performances at the Berlin Philharmonie, the Vienna Musikverein and Konzerthaus, Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Wigmore Hall London, Carnegie Hall New York, Kennedy Center Washington, Suntory Hall Tokyo, Sydney Opera House. Many orchestras have performed his works, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra in London, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, Hallé Orchestra of Manchester, Deutsches Symphonieorchester Berlin, Bamberger Symphoniker, Kölner Philharmoniker, Düsseldorfer Symphoniker, Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra, ORF Symphony Orchestra in Vienna, Warsaw Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, New Japan Philharmonic, Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Melbourne Symphony Orchestra among others. His orchestral work Guyuhmgan, from part VII of the cycle Mysterium was the foremost recommended work at UNESCO's 2002 International Rostrum of Composers in Paris. His compositions include a work for viola, orchestra and electronics called Monh written for Tabea Zimmermann, as well as Ingwe for solo electric guitar, written for the Australian guitarist Zane Banks.", "answers": ["10"], "length": 3667, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ec5670be0aea90e8e1a05d687158371f45f64a07f6177b69"}

It is the component of breath (pneuma) that shapes the material provided by the female into the correct form.\n\nParagraph 3: O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist and brought in Shaun Cooper, though the rest of the band needed convincing since they did not know him. Cooper, who had played with O'Connell in various bands throughout school, auditioned for Taking Back Sunday at the end of December 2000, playing his first show on New Year's Eve. In February 2001, the band released a five-track demo The Tell All Your Friends Demo; copies were given to anyone associated with a record label. The group then spent the year touring, during which they received offers from labels that ultimately amounted to nothing. Among these offers was one from Triple Crown Records, who were apprehensive as they had just signed Brand New, and Drive-Thru Records, whose co-owner Richard Reines had mistaken Nolan for Lacey. Eventually, the band's friend Michele Logo was in a car with Victory Records sales and A&R representative Angel Juarbe. She had the band's demo playing during the journey, before Juarbe inquired who it was. He sent a copy to Victory founder Tony Brummel, who asked to see a live performance. Within two weeks of seeing them live, a contract was written up, and the band signed to Victory in December 2001.\n\nParagraph 4: Marcus Ticotin, Sahaj's older brother and Abandon Entertainment president, financed Sahaj's first record while Sahaj was living in Greenwich, CT with mentor and friend Rob Jones.  They held open auditions in New York City to fill out the lineup with a drummer, guitarist, and bassist.  Skoota Warner was chosen as a drummer who fit in well with the blend of funk and hard rock in Sahaj's writing style.  R&B bassist Kirk Lyons and guitarist Ben Mauro, the latter of whom would later play with Lionel Richie and Britney Spears, completed the initial configuration of the band.  The members' influences did not completely mesh, but the lineup did produce one commercial track in \"Crazy Little Voices,\" which appeared as the end title track for the movie The Rage: Carrie 2.\n\nParagraph 5: Because of its high alcohol content, Bacardi 151 was particularly flammable among liquors.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Austrian consul Johann Georg von Hahn collected an Albanian tale titled Taubenliebe: a king wants his only daughter to find a husband. One day, a dove flies into her room and talks to her. The dove tells her to have a milk bowl ready for it the next day. The dove returns, bathes in the milk and becomes a handsome youth. The youth warns her to never tell anyone about him, and to wait for him for three years. They exchange rings as a vow. Some time later, the queen wants to betroth the princess to a suitor, but she mentions she is already betrothed. After, the dove does not return, and she goes on a quest for him for three years, walking in iron shoes and with three iron canes. Her quest is not successful, and she returns home. She asks her parents to build a bath house, and that any guest can enter by telling a story. One day, the daughter of a woman that lives in town wants to go to the bath house, but first she goes to the fountain to get some water. At the spring, she sees a rooster with footwear. The girl follows the rooster to a garden and to a house. Inside the house, she spies on 11 pigeons flying into the room, bathing in milk and becoming men. A 12th pigeon appears and mopes about his fiancée, who betrayed the secret. The girl returns to her mother and both decide to go to the princess's bath house to tell her the story. The tale was translated by Angelo de Gubernatis  as Il Principe Colombo (\"The Pigeon Prince\"); by Parker Fillmore as The Pigeon's Bride: The Story of a Princess who Kissed and Told (sourced as from Yugoslavia), and by Albanologist Robert Elsie as For the Love of a Dove.\n\nParagraph 2: The Huamanga Cathedral (also known as the Cathedral of Ayacucho) is the main Baroque cathedral in Ayacucho, Peru.

It is built with pink stone in the center and gray stone in the towers. Its construction began in 1632 and ended in 1672. It is considered one of the most beautiful cathedrals in Peru, especially for its interiors decorated with a Churrigueresque style.

She is very interested breaking down boundaries between genres. In an interview with Lucy Ives describing the differences between prose and fiction, Gladman described her desire to blur the two forms: Fiction is interested in a certain kind of unfolding or sequence of events. Time is more intact in fiction. Prose, I think, introduces the element of the awareness of yourself in language as you are unfolding things in time and allowing yourself to be distracted or interrupted, allowing yourself to question the difficulty of what you’re doing and be stalled, not to move. I want more fiction to do this, because it changes the way we read and understand story. With fiction that repairs all doubt and interruption and experiment by being fluid, coherent; what we expect doesn’t leave much room for me as a reader. But I think the more you talk about these categories, their distinctions, the quicker they break down. Ultimately, what I want is for there to be a blur over everything.Gladman's Ravicka cycle, four interrelated fictional books taking place in the author's invented country of Ravicka, has been compared to the fiction of Samuel Beckett, Anne Carson, and Julio Cortázar. Zack Friedman of BOMB has characterized the Ravicka series as “social science fiction,” a label that Gladman herself prefers: I definitely would prefer social science fiction to science fiction, as I really didn’t intend these books to ask deep questions about technology or bioengineering or inter-galaxy relations. Instead, they wonder about city living, architecture, language and communication, desire, and community—the same things I wonder about in my own life. For me, it needs to stay on this side of reality... and it needs to be pushing for physical space in this world.Gladman has described the very short essays that comprise Calamities as \"ditties\" becausethey feel less like they’re trying to travel; there is just one point that gets made in a quick circle. It’s funny to call them essays anyway, because they fail as essays. They don’t sustain an argument, they don’t go anywhere, they don’t conclude anything, and the half-paragraph ones seem even more so, kind of absurd.Gladman's 2017 book Prose Architectures develops Gladman's long-term interest in architecture and in the relationship between language and image in a set of drawings created through illegible script that are as visual as they are linguistic.

She is very interested breaking down boundaries between genres. In an interview with Lucy Ives describing the differences between prose and fiction, Gladman described her desire to blur the two forms: Fiction is interested in a certain kind of unfolding or sequence of events. Time is more intact in fiction. Prose, I think, introduces the element of the awareness of yourself in language as you are unfolding things in time and allowing yourself to be distracted or interrupted, allowing yourself to question the difficulty of what you’re doing and be stalled, not to move. I want more fiction to do this, because it changes the way we read and understand story. With fiction that repairs all doubt and interruption and experiment by being fluid, coherent; what we expect doesn’t leave much room for me as a reader. But I think the more you talk about these categories, their distinctions, the quicker they break down. Ultimately, what I want is for there to be a blur over everything.Gladman's Ravicka cycle, four interrelated fictional books taking place in the author's invented country of Ravicka, has been compared to the fiction of Samuel Beckett, Anne Carson, and Julio Cortázar. Zack Friedman of BOMB has characterized the Ravicka series as “social science fiction,” a label that Gladman herself prefers: I definitely would prefer social science fiction to science fiction, as I really didn’t intend these books to ask deep questions about technology or bioengineering or inter-galaxy relations. Instead, they wonder about city living, architecture, language and communication, desire, and community—the same things I wonder about in my own life. For me, it needs to stay on this side of reality... and it needs to be pushing for physical space in this world.Gladman has described the very short essays that comprise Calamities as \"ditties\" becausethey feel less like they’re trying to travel; there is just one point that gets made in a quick circle. It’s funny to call them essays anyway, because they fail as essays. They don’t sustain an argument, they don’t go anywhere, they don’t conclude anything, and the half-paragraph ones seem even more so, kind of absurd.Gladman's 2017 book Prose Architectures develops Gladman's long-term interest in architecture and in the relationship between language and image in a set of drawings created through illegible script that are as visual as they are linguistic. Gladman has cited Youmna Chlala, who also both draws and writes poetry, as an inspiration.\n\nParagraph 10: Male, female. Forewing length 4.2 mm.

Against the Philadelphia Eagles in week 5, Julius rushed for 72 yards in the first half but suffered a high ankle sprain that bothered him the entire season and was forced to sit out for 3 games. For the second straight year, Jones was considered to be injury-prone and unable to carry the load of a franchise back. Rookie running back Marion Barber III turned in several strong performances in Julius' absence creating a running back controversy.  Against the Detroit Lions Jones had rushed for 92 yards, but on 1st and goal from the 1-yard line, he was stopped 3 consecutive times. Later against the Carolina Panthers, Jones once again demonstrated his playmaking ability when rushed for two touchdowns and 194 yards. Former Cowboys quarterback and now Fox Network commentator Troy Aikman, commented on Jones' speed burst and agility, something he had not seen since Julius' rookie season in 2004. The Cowboys finished the season with an uninspiring loss the next week to the St. Louis Rams at Texas Stadium.

The west wall is standing almost intact to gable height, although the lining of the original door has been replaced by modern brickwork. The north transept is  long and  wide. The east wall of the transept is entirely gone, except for traces of its junction with the north wall. At the south end of this wall once stood a pillar; the opposite pillar, west of the south door, is almost complete and in a good state of preservation. Also in the transept there is a doorway which leads to what is thought to be a sacristy, and is the only doorway remaining in its original form. The architrave is almost complete. West of the transept there is a small chapel  long and  wide. Most of the chapel's window mouldings survive.

After the death of Bishop Cotton in 1866, Pratt started a Hill Schools' Nomination Endowment Fund to help support Bishop Cotton's scheme of starting schools in the pleasant climate of the hills for the benefit of the children of poorer English residents in India who could not afford an education in England. Pratt married Hannah Maria Brown, daughter of George Francis Brown, a Bengal Civil Servant, at Bhagalpur on 6 March 1854. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1866. Pratt served as president of the Calcutta Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals founded by Colesworthey Grant in 1861. He died from cholera when he was on a visit to Ghazipur, India, on 28 December 1871. At the instigation of Bishop Robert Milman, a memorial to Pratt was erected in St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta.\n\nParagraph 5: In 1988, Adrian Adonis returned to NJPW, immediately reuniting with Murdoch, reforming their tag team, and later forming a trio with Owen Hart. Murdoch and Adonis' only title match occurred on June 23, where they unsuccessfully faced reigning IWGP Tag Team Champions Masa Saito and Riki Choshu. The duo teamed together until Adonis' death on July 4, and after that date, Murdoch would not return to Japan for 5 months. In November 1988, Murdoch returned to NJPW, taking part into the Japan Cup Tag Team Elimination League, a round-robin tournament of trios consisting of six-man tag team elimination matches. Murdoch teamed up with Scott Hall and Bob Orton Jr., wrestling their first tournament match on November 17, defeating the six-man combination of Antonio Inoki, Riki Choshu and Kantaro Hoshino, with Murdoch last eliminating Inoki with Orton's assistance. They suffered their first loss at the hands of Masa Saito, Tatsutoshi Goto and Seiji Sakaguchi, but quickly rebounded by defeating Super Strong Machine, The Tiger and The Jaguar, with Murdoch last eliminating the Strong Machine. They later defeated Kengo Kimura, Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Osamu Kido, even though Murdoch got eliminated by Kimura during the match, his team got the win after Orton last eliminated Fujiwara. Their winning streak continued when they defeated George Takano, Steve Armstrong and Tracy Smothers, after Murdoch last eliminated Takano. However, they suffered another loss at the hands of Tatsumi Fujinami, Shinya Hashimoto and Masahiro Chono, but once again quickly rebounded by defeating Hiro Saito, Shiro Koshinaka and Kuniaki Kobayashi, after Murdoch eliminated Kobayashi and Saito. After defeating Buzz Sawyer, Manny Fernandez and Kendo Nagasaki by forfeit, they once again faced the Saito, Sakaguchi and Goto combination. In what would seem to be another loss after Hall and Orton were the two first eliminated, Murdoch single handedly eliminated Sakaguchi and Saito, before finally making quick work out of Goto, eliminating him and avenging their loss. However, the team couldn't reach the finals due to the two losses they suffered.\n\nParagraph 6: In 1988, Adrian Adonis returned to NJPW, immediately reuniting with Murdoch, reforming their tag team, and later forming a trio with Owen Hart.

Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the Egyptian and Sudanese monarchy emerged as the most important in the Middle East and the wider Arab world. Finding themselves as mere figureheads during the period of British control, Egypt and Sudan's monarchs saw their powers increased following the recognition of independence, and the subsequent adoption of the 1923 Constitution, the most liberal in the country's history. Although King Fuad I often ruled as an autocrat, partly because he repeatedly overrode some provisions of the Constitution, Egypt and Sudan had the freest parliament in the region. During Fuad's reign and that of his son, Farouk, the country witnessed six free parliamentary elections and enjoyed a free press as well as an independent judiciary. According to historian Philip Mansel, \"the Egyptian monarchy appeared so splendid, powerful and popular that King Farouk's ignominious end seems inexplicable.\" The Muhammad Ali Dynasty's downfall is often regarded as having begun with the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which greatly discredited the King. It accelerated with the growing discontent of Egypt's armed forces following the country's defeat in the First Arab-Israeli War. Disgruntled members of the military formed the Free Officers Movement, which led a coup d'état on 23 July 1952, thereby marking the beginning of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The toppling of the monarchy, and the resultant establishment of a revolutionary republican government, was the first of its kind in the modern Arab world, and was a crucial event in the region's history; it accelerated dramatically the rise of Pan-Arabism, and had a domino effect leading to similar military overthrows of the monarchies of Iraq (1958), North Yemen (1962), and Libya (1969). Egypt has had a republican form of government since the end of monarchical rule. Although the establishment of genuine democratic rule was one of the six core principles of the Revolution, political parties were banned in 1953 and the country was turned into a military dictatorship. The thriving pluralism that characterized political life during the latter period of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty's rule was thus brought to an end. Even though a multi-party system was officially restored in Egypt in 1976, the country has never recovered the level of political freedom it had enjoyed during the monarchy. In common with most deposed royal families, the Muhammad Ali Dynasty was initially vilified by the new revolutionary regime. Nonetheless, it has undergone re-evaluation in recent years; nostalgia for the former monarchy has been growing among some in Egypt, largely fuelled by the airing in 2007 of a hugely successful serial about the life of King Farouk I.\n\nParagraph 8: Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the \"Ledi forest\" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation. It was from this monastery that he would take his name, Ledi Sayadaw, meaning \"respected teacher of the Ledi forest.\" In 1885, Ledi Sayadaw wrote the Nwa-myitta-sa (), a poetic prose letter that argued that Burmese Buddhists should not kill cattle and eat beef, since Burmese farmers depended on them as beasts of burden to maintain their livelihoods, that the marketing of beef for human consumption threatened the extinction of buffalo and cattle and that the practice was ecologically unsound. He subsequently led successful beef boycotts during the colonial era, despite the presence of beef eating among locals and influenced a generation of Burmese nationalists in adopting this stance.\n\nParagraph 9: Soon, Sayadaw founded a forest monastery in the \"Ledi forest\" and began practicing and teaching intensive meditation.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Tự Đức Bảo Sao or Đồng Sao (銅鈔, billets of copper) were introduced by the Ministry of Revenue (戸部, Hộ Bộ) in the year Tự Đức 14 (1961) for large transactions and taxes on behalf of stores of the government of Đại Nam, the introduction of the Tự Đức Bảo Sao marked the redefinition of the tiền or mạch denominations and the quàn (strings of cash coins) where the quàn was made equal to 10 mạch and the mạch was made the equivalent of 60 zinc cash coins, under these exchange rates 1 quàn was worth a string of 600 zinc cash coins. The Đồng Sao series of cash coins was introduced as zinc cash coins were heavy in quantity to carry around for the payment of larger sums of money, to this end the government introduced a system of monetary units determined by their nominal value in zinc cash coins as opposed to their intrinsic market value, it is possible that this might have been inspired by contemporary Chinese coinage of the Xianfeng era in the Qing dynasty where large denomination coins from 4 up to 1000 văn circulated alongside each other with little to no difference in intrinsic value in a fiduciary system, this system was also used by the Vietnamese. When the Tự Đức Bảo Sao was first proposed the Mandarins of the imperial court of Đại Nam suggested to simply increase the weight of the brass Tự Đức Thông Bảo to make them worth more relative to the zinc Tự Đức Thông Bảo cash coins as 1 brass cash coin with a weight of 9 phần was worth four zinc cash coins. The value of the Đồng Sao cash coins was indicated on the reverses of the coins expressed in their worth in zinc cash coins preceded by the character  (chuẩn, regarded as equal to), despite the fact that Sao (鈔) means \"paper money\", though imperfectly the denominations of these coins attempted to take the respective value of brass and zinc cash coins into account which means that they can't be fully qualified as a fiat currency. The Ministry of Revenue of Đại Nam originally set the exchange rate between the brass Tự Đức Bảo Sao and zinc cash coins heavily in favour of the larger denominations which wasn't accepted by the market which resulted in the imperial court attempting to adjust the exchange rate more to the contemporary exchange values of brass and zinc cash coins that were in circulation. In January 1868 by decree the exchange rate between brass 9 phần cash and zinc cash coins was fixed 1:4 replacing the early ratio of 1:2.67 that had been in place since 1858. The Tự Đức Bảo Sao was generally well received by the population of Đại Nam despite the fact that their circulation was reduced due to their high purchasing power relative to their intrinsic value until their weight was decreased, which was done by the government to conform to the new official exchange between brass and zinc cash coins.\n\nParagraph 2: Day rose to the top of his profession during the reign of Edward VI (1547–1553). At this time, restrictions on publishers were relaxed, and a wave of propaganda on behalf of the English Reformation was encouraged by the government of the Lord Protector, Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. During the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary I, many Protestant printers fled to the continent, but Day stayed in England and continued to print Protestant literature. In 1554, he was arrested and imprisoned, presumably for these illicit printing activities. Under Queen Elizabeth I, Day returned to his premises at Aldersgate in London, where he enjoyed the patronage of high-ranking officials and nobles, including William Cecil, Robert Dudley, and Matthew Parker. With their support, he published the Book of Martyrs and was awarded monopolies for some of the most popular English books, such as The ABC with Little Catechism and The Whole Booke of Psalmes. Day, whose technical skill matched his business acumen, has been called \"the master printer of the English Reformation\".\n\nParagraph 3: Makai Club bounced back at Wrestling World 2003. Yanagisawa won the Young Generation Cup defeating Kenzo Suzuki in the semi-finals and Yutaka Yoshie in the finals. Meanwhile, Makai #1 and one night only member, Dai Majin, defeated Hiro Saito and Tatsutoshi Goto. The new members Makai #4 (being Young Lion Katsuyori Shibata) and Makai #5 (former All Japan Pro Wrestling competitor Mitsuya Nagai) defeated Takashi Iizuka and Masahito Kakihara. The group would suffer one loss with Yasuda and Murakami losing to their former Makai #3 partner Ohara and Shinsuke Nakamura. On February 1, 2003, Makai Club entered the Teisen Hall Six-Man Tag Team Tournament with Yanagisawa, Makai #1, and Makai #2 forming one team, while Kazunari Murakami, Makai #4 and #5 formed another team. However neither team would win with, as both teams lost to eventual winners Shinsuke Nakamura, Hiro Saito, and Tatsutoshi Goto. Also in February, Makai Club entered a #1 contenders tournament for the IWGP Tag Team Championship. On January 30, Makai #1 and #2 lost an entrance match to Saito and Goto, Makai #4 and #5 lost in the first round to Iizuka and Kakihara on February 6, and Yasuda and Murakami would make it to the finals where they lost to Mike Barton and Jim Steele. Despite the loss, Yasuda and Murakami would ultimately be granted the title match after Steele suffered an injury a few days later. On February 16, 2003, Yasuda and Murakami challenged Cho-Ten for the IWGP Tag Titles but would fail to win the titles, and in the main event, Yanagisawa challenged Yoshihiro Takayama for the NWF Heavyweight Championship, but lost. By the spring, the group began a feud with the Crazy Dogs (Tatsutoshi Goto, Hiro Saito, Michiyoshi Ohara and Enson Inoue) and Makai #5 began a feud with Takashi Iizuka, who recognized him as Nagai (who got him injured in June 2001) with Iizuka defeating him in a best of series (with Nagai even unmasking for the final match). On April 23, 2003, Yasuda challenged Yuji Nagata for the IWGP Title in a rematch from a year ago (where Nagata won the title from Yasuda), but Yasuda lost. At Ultimate Crush on May 2, 2003, Ken Shamrock joined the Makai Club for one night defeating Takashi Iizuka, while Murakami lost to Enson Inoue. Following Ultimate Crush, Makai Club for the most part of the year, went to the midcard and would only receive a few more title shots afterwards. On July 9, 2003, Makai #4 and #5 challenged Hiroshi Tanahashi and Yutaka Yoshie for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but came up short. On July 13, Yasuda challenged Takayama for the NWF Heavyweight Championship, but he also came up short. Yasuda and Shibata, who abandoned his Makai #4 profile, entered the 2003 G1 Climax, with Shibata finishing third, while Yasuda finished last in their block. In the fall of 2003, Makai #2 and #5 unmasked and began going by their real names, also during this time Yasuda and Makai #1 entered the 2003 G1 Tag League finishing in 5th place with 7 points.\n\nParagraph 4: The Triangle Link is part of two routes, European route E39 and County Road 542. The section from Stord to Sveio, including the Stord Bridge and the Bømlafjord Tunnel, is part of the E39 highway (the Coastal Highway) which runs along the west coast of Norway. The section from the interchange on the island of Føyno, including the Bøla Bridge and the Spissøy Bridge, is on County Road 542. The link acts both as a mainland connection for Stord and Bømlo to the mainland at Sveio, as well as a link between the two island communities, which have a combined population of 30,000.\n\nParagraph 5: As the game began Gordon-Cumming discussed the tapestry with Wilson, commenting that the different colours of the cloth made it difficult to see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the  system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as ; after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered \"My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!\" further explaining that \"the man next to me is cheating!\" After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson \"this is too hot\". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Stanley Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.\n\nParagraph 6: Makai Club bounced back at Wrestling World 2003.

She states that if Carmel does not take the children, they will be put into care. Matthew is unwilling but after Carmel's father has a stroke, Maxine brings the children to Carmel so they move in with her and Matthew. He resents them as Carmel's time is being diverted from him; finding Junior, in particular, difficult to cope with. They regularly clash, causing further animosity between Matthew and Carmel and Matthew becomes violent again, punching Carmel during an argument about Junior. She has some nasty bruises but once again a tearful Matthew convinces her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour alternates between contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel loves him and stays with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage but Junior soon realises why his aunt is constantly bruised and tries to stop the violence by telling people about the abuse but this only makes matters worse. Matthew becomes irrationally jealous of Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal, he turns violent again and attempting to protect Carmel, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife and he is rushed to hospital, where he tries to convince Carmel that he has changed. She allows him to come home and tries to get him professional help but Matthew refuses, appalled by the idea and begins smashing up the house and threatening Carmel with more violence. Finally realising that she cannot help Matthew, Carmel ends their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. The following month, Carmel's father dies, so she leaves Walford with Junior and Aisha to look after her mother.

Letterman's contract included the right to control the time slot that follows his and produce the Late Late Show and it was his production company (Worldwide Pants) that selected Ferguson as host and with whom his contracts were negotiated. With Letterman's departure, CBS would become the sole producer of the show and it is the network that determines what is done with the time slot and with which any contract is negotiated. CBS had been ambiguous in regard to Ferguson's future as host of The Late Late Show.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The PlayStation version received positive reviews. Andrew Collins of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine believed the features are \"massively improved\" over the original, and said its \"superbly polished\" gameplay made it one of the best PlayStation racing games. His main criticism was that he thought the Destruction Derby Practice mode can make players complacent. The Electric Playground complimented the scenery and damage effects. Electronic Gaming Monthlys two sports reviewers praised the larger tracks and improved crashes, and both assessed it as \"Better in every way than the first game\". Johnny Ballgame of GamePro stated that \"The original Destruction Derby looks like a mere hubcap compared to the gold-rimmed gameplay and trunkful of new features of Destruction Derby 2.\" He cited the longer tracks, arena mode, and light sourcing, but gave the game less than perfect scores as he found the announcer grating and judged the worsened steering after crashes to inordinately favor realism over enjoyment. Game Revolution described the Stock Car Racing as \"almost perfect\", and the tracks as \"extremely cool\", but criticised the steering sensitivity. Ed Lomag of Computer and Video Games lauded the improved car mechanics and track design and also liked that the UK PAL version runs in full screen at a full frame rate, thus proving British developers could make decent British PlayStation games. Despite these compliments, he criticised the game's limited re-playability. Edge praised the improved damage system resulting from the new physical modelling routines, saying the crashes are much more intense than the original. The 3D engine was described as \"impressive\", but the lack of a link-up multiplayer mode was criticised. Next Generation commented, \"As with most ground-breaking titles ... Destruction Derby created as many new problems as solutions, and the developers of Destruction Derby 2 have done an extremely nice job of correcting these faults with a much improved sequel.\" The reviewer elaborated that the game's larger tracks than the original allow the player to both build up more momentum for crashes and enjoy more of a conventional racing challenge, and that the added ability for cars to leave the ground enables true 3D crashes. Absolute PlayStation described the game as a \"vast improvement\" over the original, but said the gameplay is identical and \"rather shallow\". Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa described the graphics as \"top notch\", but also said that it breaks what was good in the original game. IGN believed that the game compensates too much for the lack of difficulty of the first game through an overly aggressive artificial intelligence and by making it \"impossible\" to catch up with the other cars. Despite this, they praised the car physics and graphics. Jeff Kitts of GameSpot extensively praised the improved crashes and new tracks: \"The winding, narrow, claustrophobic roadways of the first Destruction Derby have been replaced with huge, wide superspeedways worthy of games like NASCAR Racing and The Need for Speed.\" He remarked that the slippery road surfaces make the game more difficult to play, but considered it overall a major improvement over the first game. Jeuxvideo.com praised the playability of the game and the soundtrack, but criticised the commentary as \"repetitive\".\n\nParagraph 2: In Pakistan Television was first introduced in an exhibition near Mazar-e-Quaid on 16 September 1955. This event was arranged by American consulate in Karachi. The idea of establishing the television industry in Pakistan was conceived by the National Education Commission with the support of President Ayub Khan. Originally a private sector project in 1961 by prominent industrialist Syed Wajjid Ali who signed a joint venture agreement with Nipon Electric Company (NEC), leading Pakistani engineer Ubaidur Rahman was appointed by Wajjid Ali to head the television project. By 1962, after a series of pilot transmission tests, the project was quickly taken over by the Ayub Khan Government in 1963 for the \"greater national interest of Pakistan\". President Ayub Khan re-appointed Ubaidur Rahman in 1963 under the Ministry of Information to continue with the NEC joint venture collaboration to launch Pakistan Television or PTV. The project began with a tent on the back lot of Radio Pakistan Lahore where a transmission tower and a studio were constructed. On 26 November 1964, the first official television station commenced transmission broadcasts from Lahore, followed by Dhaka in 1965 (then the capital of East Pakistan). A third centre was established in Rawalpindi-Islamabad in 1965 and the fourth in Karachi in 1966. Later centres in Peshawar and Quetta were established by 1974. PTV was given under Television Promoters Company in 1966 which was established under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the same year. TPC was upgraded to Pakistan Television Corp in 1967. In 1972 PTV Corporation was nationalized. Originally broadcast in black and white, PTV's experimental colour transmission began on 20 December 1976. With this new upgrade in techniques and equipment, the Pakistan Television Academy was founded and opened in 1987 to teach students who wished to work in the medium. As with the other agreement, the government financed most of the funds while the private venture capitalists offered to fund the remainder. Late 1980s morning transmission started on PTV.\n\nParagraph 3: Hunting mainly consist of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted. The prey is often killed quickly by the eagle owl's powerful grip and talons though is sometimes bitten on the head to be killed as well. Then the prey item is swallowed whole or torn into pieces with the bill. The same basic hunting and killing methods are used by all owls in the genus Bubo, except that the  snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) and fish owls regularly watch for prey from a ground position (on a bank in the case of fish owls). Most hunting occurs in wood-cloaked openings, often those carved out by wetlands or watersheds. While they can and do hunt within woodlands, they are not well suited to hunting in areas with dense understories, thick foliage or tree thickets, as they seem to hunt firstly by vision and only secondarily by sounds, unlike some other owls. Eurasian eagle-owls are too heavy with relatively modest wing areas to hunt extensively on the wing although this species’ relatively short, broad wings allow it low-speed maneuverability in the moments of take off after spotting a prey item. Because of the limits of its flying abilities, the Eurasian eagle-owl requires ample, elevated perches from which to watch for prey activity and thus in most areas it will not hunt extensively in open, treeless areas, unlike smaller owls like the barn owl (Tyto alba). Tree branches are often the main hunting perches used but they will also use rock formations, rubble with large rocks, hills with tall grasses or even a building, tall pole or other elevated manmade perch. Occasionally, they may capture other birds on the wing, including nocturnal migrants, taking advantage of their distraction and diminished visual acuity to intercept them in mid-flight. They seem to hunt mostly by opportunity, taking whatever detectable prey item that is available, preferably those that are active. Most prey, even up to the size of small rabbits, are swallowed whole. While a small rodent can easily be swallowed in an instant, if the prey item is large, the swallowing process can appear grueling and grotesque and in some cases eagle-owl nestlings have choked to death while attempting to swallow overly large prey (i.e. moorhens). Small prey is often swallowed immediately after capture, although occasionally it is carried in the bill to the nest for the young or to a roost for quick consumption. Larger prey is normally carried in the owl's feet and is more likely than smallish prey to be brought to the nest due to its nutritional value. Exceptionally large prey (probably any over ) is consumed on the ground where it is killed, possibly being torn apart into manageable pieces. This leaves the owl vulnerable to loss of their prey to scavengers or to confrontations with heavier predators. The undigestable portions of prey are regurgitated in the form of pellets as in all owls. Pellets of the Eurasian eagle-owl average around , thus they are around the same size as those of most other large Bubo owls, even the notably smaller great horned owl (B. virginianus). In some cases, pellets of Bubo owls can range up to  in length. Eagle-owl pellets average slightly larger (about 10%) than those of great grey owls (Strix nebulosa). As is the case with all owls, pellets are indisputably the best method to examine the main diversity of prey consumed by an owl. However, it is also important to examine the prey remains left around a roost or nest when available. Larger prey, which may be torn apart before the eating of portions or fleshy parts of the prey item, is frequently determined solely by remains rather pellets as are birds, in which the wings, feet and some feathers may be removed before consumption. As in the great horned owl, after capturing larger prey, the Eurasian eagle-owl often beheads it. In part, this may be due to making prey easier to carry off and, in both large owl species, it is considered a signature indicator for predator identification.\n\nParagraph 4: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor. Posthumous nominations are accepted within one year of the date of death and in 2001 the Provincial Emblems and Honours Act was amended to allow for honorary membership in the order, granted to those who are neither current nor former residents of Saskatchewan; Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, was the first honorary member of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, having been appointed on 24 April 2001. The lieutenant governor, who is ex officio a member and the Chancellor of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and remains a member following his or her departure from viceregal office, then makes all appointments into the fellowship's single grade of membership by letters patent bearing the viceroyal sign-manual and the Great Seal of the province; thereafter, the new Members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters SOM and have their portrait added to the Athabasca Gallery at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building.\n\nParagraph 5: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor.

For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the \"third nature,\" which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the \"unconscious\". According to Rowan Wilken, neuromantic architecture favors virtuality in techno-spatial and philosophical senses as well as a lack of engagement with actual reality and the questions about place and community. \n\nParagraph 7: The process of finding qualified individuals begins with call for nominations put out each spring by the Saskatchewan Honours Advisory Council, which then makes its selected recommendations to the lieutenant governor.

Fairchild subsequently manufactured a larger, stretched version of the F-27 named the Fairchild Hiller FH-227, which was operated by U.S.-based air carriers Delta Air Lines, Mohawk Airlines, Northeast Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989),  and Wien Air Alaska.\n\nParagraph 9: Hunting mainly consist of the owl watching from a perch for prey activity and then swooping down swiftly once prey is spotted.

Twice in this portion (lines 514 and 540) that sund is used is in the same lines as rēon, and both times forming the three-word phrase on sund rēon, which would seem to mean \"rowing on the sea\" – but there is an Anglo-Saxon word, onsund, which means “sound, physically strong, uninjured”, in most transcriptions of the Beowulf text it does not occur, but in the original manuscript, at line 513 on and sund have apparently been rewritten after being scraped from the parchment and seem slightly closer together than two separate words ordinarily are (although Zupitza's transcription treats them as two separate words), and in line 540 the manuscript clearly uses onsund as a single word and Zupitza transcribes it as a single word – although he drew a thin line of separation after on, which may indicate that he did not know that onsund was a word with a meaning of its own. Onsund is found in a lot of other Anglo-Saxon artifacts. In Icelandic, at least, sund requires a preposition, not found here in Beowulf, to mean swimming rather than merely something aquatic.\n\nParagraph 11: The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 were four identical streamlined 2-car power car diesel-electric train sets delivered in May, June, and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine Corporation of General Motors and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors. One was for the City of San Francisco, two were for the City of Denver, and one was a spare set intended for both routes. In 1939, M-10004 was split and converted into additional boosters for the other sets, now renumbered CD-05, CD-06, and CD-07, all running on the City of Denver. The M-10001 power car became the other third booster. In this form, the three power sets ran until they were replaced by E8 locomotives in 1953, at which point they were scrapped.\n\nParagraph 12: The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10003, M-10004, M-10005, and M-10006 were four identical streamlined 2-car power car diesel-electric train sets delivered in May, June, and July 1936 from Pullman-Standard, with prime movers from the Winton Engine Corporation of General Motors and General Electric generators, control equipment and traction motors.

Their 1957 song \"Do the Bop\" came to the attention of Dick Clark, who suggested they rename it to \"At the Hop\".  After limited initial success with the song, it became a worldwide hit when it was played on American Bandstand. The Juniors went on to have two more hits \"Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay\" and \"Twistin' USA\". The Juniors released several more records in the 1960s but were not able to produce any more hits.

Beowulf and Breca could have been rowing together or competing to see who was the more prodigious rower. The Old English term rēon, used twice in this portion of Beowulf (namely lines 513 and 540), is not translated as “swim” in any other Anglo-Saxon poetry.

All of a sudden, Nisa has to swerve out of the way because of a flaming truck that's been knocked sideways on the road- which turns out to be the truck that was carrying the Hydra agents. Nisa is doubly shocked to see a shadowy figure in the middle of the flames that looks like Angela, Loki's sister and bodyguard.

The setting then changes to Doomstadt, Latveria- the home of Doom's Children, a terrorist organization, the members of which are inspecting two men in a van upon their entrance to the city, who reveal after their inspection that they intend to get weapons from the inside. After a brief scene where Loki talks to a fan at the Iowa State Fair about an entire meal on a stick- a partly caramelized apple, a few onion rings, and a hamburger, all on an ice cream cone, the god of mischief goes to a debate with the other two presidential candidates. Nisa, who is inside but still covering the debate, remarks that Angela, last seen at the site of the truck crash, is at the corner of the debate, looking unharmed. The scene only covers the first question of the debate, which is about the response of the U.S. to the political situation in Latveria, since Doctor Doom, a super villain and former leader of Latveria, is gone. While the two other candidates agree that the U.S.A. should send troops to Latveria, and express their discontentment with Loki's campaign ad- revealing that unlike the ad, the candidates had apparently not requested a Skype meeting with Doom's Children. However, Loki simply acknowledged the lie- arguing that it was indeed true that the female candidate, who had brought up the Skype statement, would prefer a peaceful and diplomatic solution, and that the ad was then accurate. He then asks why he is the only person being berated for lying, and that he does not think that American soldiers should go die in Latveria. Meanwhile, Nisa purchases a ticked to Latveria, and when the scene changes to a few days later, in Doomstadt, the reader can see Nisa, in disguise among a group of masked Latverians, revealed shortly thereafter to be the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance, all infiltrating Doctor Doom's castle. After they sneak in to the castle, they attempt to open a weapon cache door, failing the first time but succeeding the second. However, before they can escape the castle with their weapons, they are stopped by Doom's Children and an unidentified person from the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance creates an explosion, killing both groups. The scene flashes to a battlement above the explosion, where one of the Latverian New Prosperity Alliance men changes appearance and is revealed to be Loki in disguise, who then steps through a magic portal to see the United Metal Workers of Wisconsin.

In other words, it happens quite often that certain dates do not appear in the Tibetan almanac and certain dates occur twice. But there are no natural days or week days that occur twice or which are omitted.\n\nParagraph 6: Ceol was the son of Cutha (or Cuthwulf), the son of Cynric of Wessex. He reigned from either 591 or 592 to 597. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, he began his reign in 591, but it was only in the following year that he drove out his uncle Ceawlin in a battle at Woden's Barrow in Wiltshire, thus denying the throne to the rightful heir, Ceawlin's son Cuthwine. Upon his death the throne passed to his brother Ceolwulf. Because his son Cynegils was presumably too young to inherit the throne, it was given to the brother, as was probably the custom among the Saxons.  In 1967 Wright and Jackson found a stone at Wroxeter in a Sub-Roman context (dating to c. 460 – 475 AD[4]) with the inscription CUNORIX MACUS MAQVI COLINE, which translates as \"Cunorix ('Hound-king' = Cynric) son of Maqui-Coline ('Son-of-Holly'), both of which are regarded as Irish personal names.\n\nParagraph 7: A Tibetan calendar month normally starts with the week day or natural day ( or ) in which the first tithi () ends.

The episode \"My Intern's Eyes\" was shown through (but not narrated from) Keith's point of view. Keith was introduced as a timid intern who became very popular amongst his fellow interns and some senior staff. J.D. took Keith under his wing and taught him the ropes. Despite all this, J.D. grew to irrationally dislike Keith, who quickly began to excel in his hospital duties, and furthermore because Keith was a \"booty call\" that progressed into a relationship with Elliot. However, J.D. soon decided that he would like Keith because Elliot did, and admitted that Keith had genuine skills as a doctor, with the two becoming good friends soon after. J.D. also admitted in one episode that, had Elliot never worked at the hospital, he and Keith would probably have immediately become best friends. Despite J.D.'s dislike of Keith, the two have a great deal in common—which may explain Elliot's interest in him. Elliot, who spoke fluent German, informed J.D. that Keith's last name meant \"master of dudes\" in German. Keith and Ted would eventually become best friends. In \"His Story IV\", Keith revealed himself to be a Republican, which strengthened his relationship with Elliot, as she was also one. Eventually, Keith moved in with Elliot and she confessed that she loved him. Keith later proposed to her, and they quickly began to plan a wedding. Elliot, doubting her love for Keith, had second thoughts and cold feet, responding by nearly cheating on Keith with J.D. She decided to break off the engagement. Their relationship became very strained, with Keith insulting Elliot whenever he saw her. While he eventually acted professionally at work with her, he alternated between anger and depression outside of the workplace. Elliot made jokes about her leaving him, but Ted informed her that Keith was still hurt and pretended to be over it only when she was around. Elliot finally realized his feelings in \"My Jerks\" and sincerely apologized for hurting him. Keith responded by saying he had really needed to hear that. He appeared again in \"My Finale\" in J.D.'s final daydream of all the people he had met at Sacred Heart.\n\nParagraph 9: Part of the Colcombe estate was purchased by William Pole Esquire (d. 1588), who had purchased Shute House in 1560. His son Sir William Pole (1561–1635), the antiquary, purchased the remaining shares from the heirs of the Courtenays, and rebuilt the house, as he recorded after 1618 in his \"Collections towards a History of Devon\": A goodly building was here intended by the last erles but altogether unfinished, and nowe the whole being reduced from all ye co-heires unto my possession, I have newe built the howse and made it the place of my residinge\". Sir William resided most of his younger life at Shute, until 1618, during which time he let his son John, later the 1st Pole baronet, live in the former building at Colcombe, as is evidenced  by the record of the birth of John's second  son Courtenay Pole, which described his father as  \"John Pole of Colcombe\". In 1618 Sir William Pole exchanged residences with his son John, to whom he let Shute, and himself moved to Colcombe, which he then set about rebuilding and where he died in 1635.  During the Civil War it served in 1644 as the headquarters of Prince Maurice (d. 1652), who used it as a base for his attack on Stedcombe, then being used as a garrison for parliamentary troops by its owner Sir Walter Erle. It was almost completely destroyed, with only part of the kitchen and a large fireplace having survived. During the conflagration, many of the volumes of the manuscripts of the antiquary's great work on the history of Devon, with substantial additions made by his son the 1st baronet, were destroyed. After the Civil War part was rebuilt on the other side of a lane as  a farmhouse. Colcombe appears to have passed out of the Pole family after the time of the 1st baronet, but was repurchased by  Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757–1799), the builder of New Shute House, possibly from Sir George Yonge of Colyton, from whom he had acquired several large properties in 1790. The 6th baronet seems to have decided to re-build it in the grand style of its former existence when owned by Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (1498–1539). However he died before his plan could be effected and stipulated in his will that his heirs should build \"a good substantial dwelling-house  with suitable offices and at least five acres of land in Colcombe Park where his widow should live\". It is unlikely the request was ever acted upon. His widow is known to have spent her last days at Lindridge House near Plymouth tending her sick brother.\n\nParagraph 10: A Tibetan calendar month normally starts with the week day or natural day ( or ) in which the first tithi () ends.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Alexander was a son of the penultimate king of the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti in eastern Georgia, Heraclius II, who entrusted him various military and administrative tasks. After the death of Heraclius in 1798, he opposed the accession of his half-brother George XII and the new king's renewed quest for Russian protection. After the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, Alexander fled the country and spent decades in a series of attempts to undermine the Russian control of his homeland. Eventually, Alexander's reliance on the Persian support and North Caucasian mercenaries deprived him of popular support. After his last major rebellion was defeated in 1812, Alexander permanently settled in Persia, where he died in obscurity in 1844.\n\nParagraph 2: Problems with the management of Washington Harbour first became public on October 27, 1987, when the complex's lead restaurant, Warner LeRoy's high-priced and luxurious Potomac, closed without warning. The Washington Post, quoting unnamed restaurant industry sources, said Potomac offered mediocre food at a high price, spent too much constructing the restaurant, was too large, and did not turn over diners fast enough. But LeRoy blamed Western Development, saying that tenant fees skyrocketed to $300,000 a year from $45,000 a year, trash collection was poor, landscaping was incomplete, fire alarms rang when there was no fire, management did not complete a covered walkway from the parking lot to the entrance, and the plumbing was poor. LeRoy further claimed that he spent $1 million on legal fees fighting Western Development (which managed the property). The Post quoted another unnamed restaurant owner in the building who agreed that Western Development was \"a pain\" to deal with. (A lawsuit filed by LeRoy against Western Development was settled out of court in November 1987.) By the end of October, other anonymous retail and office tenants were complaining to The Washington Post that they, too, encountered high unexpected costs and that Western Development was unresponsive to their complaints about physical plant problems. Several condominium owners in the complex also complained of rising costs, which included charges to cover real estate tax increases, fees for routine janitorial services (such as trash collection, sidewalk cleaning, and window washing), and parking garage charges. Some unidentified tenants also claimed they were misled about the project's operating costs, learning only too late that they did not cover all operating costs nor the real estate taxes; that space was often not finished until six months after the delivery date; that construction errors were not corrected; and that on-site employment (which retailers depended on for sales projections) would be 2,500 people but ended up being only 1,200 people (even though 85 percent of the complex was leased). The Washington Post quoted an unnamed industry source, who said Western \"mistreated tenants\" and \"had no regard for their needs\". But other tenants, such as Arthur Young & Co., Holcomb & Co., and Tony & Joe's said they were satisfied with Western Development's management of Washington Harbour. Western Development blamed the District government for rising costs, claiming the city had doubled the real estate tax on the complex in the past year. The rising operating fees caused the Hays Harmon gift shop to close and the owner of Cafe Rose to attempt to sell the business.\n\nParagraph 3: On August 26, Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson led his corps of the Army of Northern Virginia through Thoroughfare Gap, on his way to raiding the Union supply depot at the Manassas Junction. In response to the raid, the following day Union Maj. Gen. Irwin McDowell set out from Warrenton to Manassas Junction to engage Jackson. In order to protect his army's left flank, he dispatched Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts's brigade and the 1st New Jersey Cavalry under Sir Percy Wyndham towards the Gap. Ricketts stopped at Gainesville,  to the east, while Wyndham occupied the gap. Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's corps, meanwhile, followed in the path of Jackson's march and was approaching the gap from the west late on the evening of August 27.\n\nParagraph 4: Problems with the management of Washington Harbour first became public on October 27, 1987, when the complex's lead restaurant, Warner LeRoy's high-priced and luxurious Potomac, closed without warning. The Washington Post, quoting unnamed restaurant industry sources, said Potomac offered mediocre food at a high price, spent too much constructing the restaurant, was too large, and did not turn over diners fast enough. But LeRoy blamed Western Development, saying that tenant fees skyrocketed to $300,000 a year from $45,000 a year, trash collection was poor, landscaping was incomplete, fire alarms rang when there was no fire, management did not complete a covered walkway from the parking lot to the entrance, and the plumbing was poor. LeRoy further claimed that he spent $1 million on legal fees fighting Western Development (which managed the property). The Post quoted another unnamed restaurant owner in the building who agreed that Western Development was \"a pain\" to deal with. (A lawsuit filed by LeRoy against Western Development was settled out of court in November 1987.) By the end of October, other anonymous retail and office tenants were complaining to The Washington Post that they, too, encountered high unexpected costs and that Western Development was unresponsive to their complaints about physical plant problems. Several condominium owners in the complex also complained of rising costs, which included charges to cover real estate tax increases, fees for routine janitorial services (such as trash collection, sidewalk cleaning, and window washing), and parking garage charges. Some unidentified tenants also claimed they were misled about the project's operating costs, learning only too late that they did not cover all operating costs nor the real estate taxes; that space was often not finished until six months after the delivery date; that construction errors were not corrected; and that on-site employment (which retailers depended on for sales projections) would be 2,500 people but ended up being only 1,200 people (even though 85 percent of the complex was leased). The Washington Post quoted an unnamed industry source, who said Western \"mistreated tenants\" and \"had no regard for their needs\". But other tenants, such as Arthur Young & Co., Holcomb & Co., and Tony & Joe's said they were satisfied with Western Development's management of Washington Harbour. Western Development blamed the District government for rising costs, claiming the city had doubled the real estate tax on the complex in the past year. The rising operating fees caused the Hays Harmon gift shop to close and the owner of Cafe Rose to attempt to sell the business.\n\nParagraph 5: On August 26, Maj. Gen.

Construction commenced in May 1982. The station was built under two interfacing construction contracts. The 7.6-metre-diameter station tunnels (which contain the platforms) were built by Nishimatsu Construction, a Japanese contractor, under particularly difficult geological conditions. The off-street station concourse was constructed by a joint venture formed by Gammon Construction, Kier, and a now-defunct Scottish contractor called Lilley. The concourse was constructed within diaphragm walls from the top down, and was designed to support a new Urban Council complex and residential estate (called Felicity Garden) above it.\n\nParagraph 7: On August 26, Maj.

It has an ending that comes not only as a complete surprise — which would be easy enough — but that also pulls everything together in a new way, one we hadn't thought of before, one that's almost unbearably poignant.\" Ebert ranked Night Moves at No. 2 on his year-end list of the best films of 1975, behind only Nashville. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that he had \"mixed feelings\" about the film, elaborating that the characters \"seem to deserve better than the quality of the narrative given them. I can't figure out whether the screenplay by Alan Sharp was worked on too much or not enough, or whether Mr. Penn and his actors accepted the screenplay with more respect than it deserves.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three stars out of four and stated that the protagonist is the \"kind of mixed-up character\" that \"seems to be Hackman's specialty\", while Alan Sharp's screenplay \"provides the character of Paula (Jennifer Warren) with some of the best scripting for any woman this year\". Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called the film \"a paradox. A suspenseless suspenser, very well cast with players who lend sustained interest to largely theatrical characters ... There's little rhyme or reason for the plot's progression, and the climax is far from stunning. But the curious aspect about the Warner Bros. release is that it plays well.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"a stunning, stylish detective mystery in the classic Raymond Chandler-Ross Macdonald mold,\" as well as \"a fast, often funny movie with lots of compassionately observed real, living, breathing people. This handsome Warners presentation is still another triumph for ever-busy, ever-versatile Gene Hackman, director Arthur Penn and writer Alan Sharp.\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post was negative, stating, \"The fatal weakness is Alan Sharp's screenplay, a pointlessly murky, ambiguous variation on conventional private-eye themes ... we're supposed to be so impressed by the dolorous, world-weary tone that we overlook some pretty awesome loopholes and absurdities in the story itself, which never generates much mystery, suspense or credible human interest.\"\n\nParagraph 9: During the construction of a road in 1961, an ancient burial complex was discovered in the eastern part of the site. An archaeological expedition by the Israel Antiquities Authority led by Joseph Naveh (1928-2011) of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found two Iron Age II multi-chamber burial caves. One cave consisted of three chambers cut into the chalky limestone. Eight skeletons lay on limestone ledges around the sides of the chambers, untouched since being laid to rest. A ring, a bronze earring and a bronze plaque were also found in the cave, which contained carved drawings and inscriptions. Three of the drawings were of human figures: a man holding what might be a lyre, a man raising his arms, possibly in a prayer gesture, and a man wearing a headdress. Two sailing vessels were sketched on another wall. Two other figures may be an encampment and a tent. The ships lead scholars to believe that the chambers were reused by Israelite refugees fleeing the Chaldaean armies in the sixth century BCE, probably Levites. Ships are a common motif in ancient Near Eastern burial chambers. The other cave had been looted at some point, and analysis revealed that the interred individuals belonged to a group of different origin than the first group.\n\nParagraph 10: The site of the present-day station concourse was home to the old Sai Wan Ho Market, operated by the Urban Council, which was demolished to make way for the MTR station.

This place is also revered as the mystical land of Shambhala by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the Tibetan region, nearby Kailash parvat. Though any Sadhu, Sannyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs.The context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a divine place in spiritual journey. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Siddhashram is considered as the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishis. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. It's believed by Hindus, Buddhists that it is possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path. Siddhashram is considered to be a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where it is said and is believed by Hindus that great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is believed to be the ashram of Ancient saints, sages & Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics, the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, one of the oldest scripture of human civilization. Siddhashram is considered to be the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place, as considered by believers. Its believed that this ashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash.

Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are believed to be found meditating in this place. Those who allegedly went there say that the beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words. The exact location of this legendary kingdom is unknown as it is believed that Gyanganj artfully camouflages (willingly hides itself) itself from humans, as well as mapping technologies.

Rajiv is smitten by her and manages to woo her with the help of his friend Rocky. Meanwhile, Mambo and Payal become close, Mambo tries to cheer her up and always be with her. Payal still cares a lot for Rajiv and is silently hurt at seeing Alisha and Rajiv together. Nevertheless, she continues to talk to Rajiv and wishes him a happy birthday. Rajiv is taken aback because Payal and not Alisha bothered to wish him first, as Alisha is busy with her modeling shoot. Rajiv starts noticing that Payal and Mambo are coming close, which concerns him a lot. Rajiv is surprised to find Payal at his birthday party in a pub. Payal gets emotional and tells him she now thinks that her views about love were wrong, and that is why Rajiv is so happy with Alisha, something which was not with Payal. Mambo and Rajiv come to blows because of Payal, and Alisha slowly starts disliking Payal. The final straw is when Alisha sees Rajiv and Payal talking, and she learns from a mutual friend that they were together before she entered the college. She confronts Payal, behaves rudely with her, and accuses her of stealing her boyfriend. Mambo tries to defend Payal, and Alisha puts him off, which infuriates him. Rajiv and Mambo get into a big fight. Alisha and Rajiv leave with everyone accusing him of fighting with his friends. At Alisha's flat, Rajiv cannot think of anything else but how Payal loved him and let her go, and how after their break up, she still cared for him and the recent fight. Alisha gets insecure and keeps asking him to profess his love. He, imagining Alisha to be Payal, hugs her and says, \"I love you, Payal.\"\n\nParagraph 3: The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on eight reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". The New York Times was very positive about Own the Night and wrote this third album \"elevates this group's fecklessness to high art. It makes no apologies for its blunt-force tactics. It owns its shamelessness. That cocksure stance helps to make it one of the most convincing albums of the year, a huge leap forward for a group that threatened to become famous without leaving a true mark.\" Giving it a four stars rating out of five, Country Weekly Jessica Phillips appreciated that \"For the most part, Lady Antebellum strikes a nice balance between the two -creating something different while replicating some elements of the previous album, keeping the penchant for bighearted ballads and the vocal chemistry between Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott intact\". Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the album a 3.5 stars out of 5 commenting \"In an effort to break new ground on their just released album, Own the Night,  Lady Antebellum occasionally forget their strengths and weaknesses. Not every courageous step they take lands on solid ground, but it’s difficult to criticize a band for taking artistic chances.\" Entertainment Weekly gave the album a \"B\" grade commenting \"With their easy pop-country tempos and ingratiating white-soul harmonies, Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott, and Dave Haywood are masters of the soft sell, an approach they employ here with characteristically genteel results.\" Randy Lewis of The Los Angeles Times found that \"everything sounds bigger, brighter and shinier than on Lady A's first two albums. That'll probably go over well with fans of grandiose country pop\" but he noted that \"the all-stops-out production gradually loses impact.\" However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic was less enthusiastic about the album. He gave it a three stars rating and described it as \"mood music but the aim isn't amorous; it's nothing more than a spot of relaxation, which doesn't quite amount to compelling listening no matter how immaculate the execution.\" American Songwriter found Own the Night not \"high art\" and despised the \"clichéd country images\" but did appreciate the singing \"with the band stacking its harmonies three voices deep at every twist and turn\" and that's why the album received a three stars rating. Nevertheless, Rolling Stone Will Hermes was not convinced by the new album and gave it a two stars rating out of five. Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine negatively reviewed Own the Night: \"In the past, the trio has been able to elevate their unremarkable songwriting with spirited performances, but that isn't the case on Own the Night\". He found the band \"across-the-board amateurish and anonymous\".\n\nParagraph 9: The Outfit rose to power in the 1920s under the control of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, and the period was marked by bloody gang wars for control of the distribution of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.

The most prominent of them was the Chutiya rulers who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya conflict in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the Ahom dynasty. The Ahoms created a new position called Bhatialia Gohain to control the region. The area was later given by Ahoms to the Baro-Bhuyans to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the Chutiya and Kachari kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 CE in the west of the Subansiri river as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers (near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The Burmese, who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the British under the Treaty of Yandabo. They placed the southern part of the state, together with Sivasagar under the rule of Purandar Singha; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nParagraph 3: On July 25, 2010, it was announced that Toyota would make her first wrestling appearance in the United States, wrestling for the Chikara promotion in September.

The following day in Brooklyn, New York, Toyota and Mike Quackenbush defeated the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli and Sara Del Rey) in a tag team match. On February 10, 2011, Chikara announced that Toyota would be returning to the promotion in April to take part in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where she would team up with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On April 15, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match in the 2011 King of Trios. The following day, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush were eliminated from the tournament by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki).

The most prominent of them was the Chutiya rulers who held the areas of the present district for long, until the outbreak of the Ahom-Chutiya conflict in the 16th century and eventually the area came under the rule of the Ahom dynasty. The Ahoms created a new position called Bhatialia Gohain to control the region. The area was later given by Ahoms to the Baro-Bhuyans to rule like feudal lords, as they had helped defeat the Chutiya and Kachari kingdoms. There was a Chutia principality formed by the king Lakshminarayan in the start of the 15th century upon which the district has been named. The copperplate inscription of a land grant given by the Chutia king in the year 1403 CE in the west of the Subansiri river as well as the ruins between Dhal and Ghagar rivers (near present-day North Lakhimpur town) shows the evidence of the settlement. The Burmese, who had ruined the native kingdoms, at the end of the 18th century, was in 1826 expelled by the British under the Treaty of Yandabo. They placed the southern part of the state, together with Sivasagar under the rule of Purandar Singha; but it was not till 1838 that the whole was taken under direct British Administration.\n\nParagraph 5: The objectives of the RDAs were set out in the Regional Economic Strategy (RES) of each region.  The RES was a document created and maintained by the RDA for the whole region, i.e. it was not simply a document to guide the RDA, it was intended to guide the work of other organisations also.  Each RDA updated their RES on a regular basis (approximately every three years) by consulting widely with their partners, and stakeholders in the region, including local government, voluntary organisations, private organisations, and other interested groups. The RES was submitted to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for formal approval.\n\nParagraph 6: Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the Brahmaputra.

The following day in Brooklyn, New York, Toyota and Mike Quackenbush defeated the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli and Sara Del Rey) in a tag team match. On February 10, 2011, Chikara announced that Toyota would be returning to the promotion in April to take part in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where she would team up with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On April 15, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match in the 2011 King of Trios. The following day, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush were eliminated from the tournament by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki).

When Sylvia's lesson is over Julia tells her to go play and take her new doll with her but Sylvia says that she lost it. While going out with Carlos and Eugenio, Marina is driving and feels a strong pain in her wrist causing her to almost crash the car. That evening the adults hear Yago whimpering in pain and go outside to check him but Julia stays inside and go to check on Sylvia who is already in bed but instead finds her looking out the window. Julia asked Sylvia what she's doing and Sylvia turns around with a smirk on her face and tells Julia that the dog is dead. Unable to explain Yago's death they bury him in the yard the next day. As Julia is brushing Sylvia's hair she talks to her about the importance of going to school and reading but Sylvia says that those things aren't necessary because Hugo has knows everything thanks to a book about black magic. She also tells Julia that Hugo was the son of a black magic sorcerer who before dying learned of a way to revive after a thousand years but he had to make sure that his son would take care of the book until his revival so he made hugo hold the book and turned him into stone. Marina then starts having a strong pain in her leg so Eugenio takes her to their room and call a doctor. While Mariana is getting medical attention Julia tells Eugenio and Carlos what Sylvia said about Hugo but Eugenio still believes she is mentally ill and is repeating something she heard. The doctor tells Eugenio that Mariana's leg is better but now she has a headache. Mariana tells Eugenio that she feels threatened by something sinister and spiritual and that she can't stop thinking of Hugo. While Carlos is painting a portrait of Hugo's statue, the statue disappears frightening him. He runs away and is then frightened by Sylvia who ask him why he was painting Hugo. They walk back to the statue and it is again in its place but Sylvia get angry at Carlos saying he ruined her fun. He goes back to painting and Julia compliments his painting before going to look for Sylvia but instead finds Sylvia's doll hung up in the courtyard with needles stuck in the same parts where Mariana felt the pain. She shows the doll to Carlos and they decide that instead of telling Eugenio they want to talk to Sylvia. In her next lesson Sylvia sees the doll and is frightened by it claiming she doesn't want it anymore.\n\nParagraph 11: Lakhimpur figures largely in the annals of Assam as the region where tribes from the east first reached the Brahmaputra.

I knew no other condition, I doubted not that the world was all friendly. But when I was torn from the companions of my childhood, and removed to a distance from kindred and home, and placed among strangers, I found, to my sad disappointment, that I was of little consequence to the world around me, and that none but myself cared for my comfort and welfare. Then it was that I learned to value the joys, and thousand social endearments of home. Then it was, that I learned duly to estimate the consolation which springs from the mature sympathy of school-fellows. Then, and not till then, did I know what it was to want a friend to smooth down the bed of sickness…  For it is a law of nature, that we know not the worth of our enjoyments, until the time arrives when they are to be interrupted. Then, and not till then, do we feel the wants of them…   I want you to reflect upon the many happy hours you have here enjoyed, that you may, in after years, when surrounded, perhaps with disease, and danger, and death, receive comfort and consolation by the retrospection.  It will be so delightful, yet so deeply affecting, when old age is upon you, to tell over the scenes and the frolics of your school-boy days! I have been acquainted with many village schools, but none did I ever witness so much mutual good will, so great manifestations of true and sincere friendship, as I have witnessed in this. You have always seemed to me, to constitute one great Family; and I have often thought you are indeed a band of Brothers and Sisters! For my own part, having spent two winters with you, I am, and shall always be ready to bear testimony to your depth of sympathy and kindly feeling as friends, and your faithfulness and diligence as scholars. During the last winter, my attention was so strongly attracted by these qualities, and by the kindness with which I was uniformly treated, that I formed an attachment to you, which not ever time, but death alone can sever… And am I no more to have my ears greeted with the endearing title of Master? - a title which has always suggested to my mind, so many pleasing emotions!  … Be assured, I shall not forget you.\"", "answers": ["2"], "length": 3849, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a7a94aecaea08f0d2799fe3ca3af73a9fc5317a7860d7909"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The late Lippy Espinda, a used car salesman and Oahu-based entertainer, has also been named as a possible creator of the shaka. Espinda, who frequently appeared as an extra in Hawaii Five-O as well as The Brady Bunch episodes shot in Hawaii, used the term and the sign during his television ads in the '60s. Though the claim that he is the originator of the shaka sign is debatable, he is credited with increasing its popularity and that of Hawaiian Pidgin as well. The shaka has achieved great popularity in Australia, primarily among teenagers on social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook.\n\nParagraph 2: In late 1943 the 2nd Panzer Division was sent to France for refitting after the heavy losses it suffered on the Eastern Front. The division was equipped with Panther tanks. Following the invasion of Normandy, the division was moved to Normandy in June 1944; it engaged British troops of the 50th Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division. From June 6 until mid July the division stood in the Caumont area engaged in daily skirmishes with British units. During Operation Epsom a group of six Panther tanks of the Pz.Rg.3 was used for a counterattack to take Cheux but that attack failed and five of their tanks were lost. Although the 2nd Panzer Division was very experienced the German doctrine overall was flawed and could not be exploited in Normandy. All German Panzer divisions in Normandy suffered severe defeats when counterattacking. The division was relieved at Caumont by the 326th Infantry Division and sent to the Verrières ridge southwest of Caen. During the Canadian Operation Spring a Kampfgruppe from the division (Kampfgruppe Sterz) was sent to reinforce the 272nd Infantry division at St. Andre sur Orne and St. Martin. The Kampfgruppe took St. Martin, destroying The Black Watch in the process and got involved in street fighting in St. Andre sur Orne. Kampfgruppe Zollhöfer of the 9th SS Panzer Division took over and struck towards Point 67. After Operation Spring 2nd Panzer was sent to the US sector to help in halting Operation Cobra. They could stop the drive of the US 2nd Armored for a moment but were too weak to cover the whole front. The division retreated and with its last 25 tanks it took part in Operation Luttich, the failed German counterattack at Mortain. It was later encircled in the Falaise pocket, but broke out with heavy losses in materiel and troops. At Falaise it was responsible for taking and holding St-Lambert-sur-Dive but was only able to take one part of the village. Nevertheless due to the efforts of the 2nd Panzer Division other German units, notably the 10th and the 12th SS, were able to cross the bridge over the Dives and escape eastwards. The division was reorganised in Germany, absorbing the depleted 352nd Infantry Division. Due to the shortage in materiel, the division's complement of tanks was significantly reduced. Some tank companies only had assault guns, although one battalion received Panther tanks.\n\nParagraph 3: Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year, more recently wrote that the film is one \"of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s\" and praised its \"winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit,\" while another critic, Dennis Schwartz, wrote that the \"film's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes, witty use of photography, and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body, space and time. Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video, still photography, and performance art with elements from Cubism, Surrealism, Dada and avant-garde cinema.\" Artforum noted in November 1980 that \"[w]atching their scenes together, we realize how seldom, if ever before, the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman. Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions\" and it was called one \"of the most original films in this year's exposition\" and a \"tour de force of cinematic invention\" grounded in the director's \"fresh and intelligent sensibility, characteristically self-referential. Her visual resources include mirrors, still photography, video, dance, and films within the film, all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness\" by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition. Similarly, critic Alison Butler wrote that the \"film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience, culture and environment\" and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film \"makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing – in life and in art\" and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important \"crossover film\" combining \"avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities, made during the mid-1970s. It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman; blending narrative experimentation, fantasy, fact and theoretical critique, it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it.\" PopMatters noted that the film has \"enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin\" and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a \"weird, restless, beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork.\" The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977, it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called \"seminal\" during a screening at a repertory cinema, \"a strong and humoristic showdown\" at another and \"a sonically-complex, montage-rich, darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema\" during a screening at a New York University class. Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper Kurier that \"Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid, striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages.\" Critic Chris Holmlund, author of the scholarly article \"Feminist Makeovers: The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich,\" referred to Invisible Adversaries as a feminist version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to Un Chien Andalou, and wrote that therefore it \"is visually rick, entertaining, striking, but also demanding.\" A few reviews, however, were negative. For example, London's Time Out wrote about the film that it is \"[n]ot unlike W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism\" and that it will \"probably age as badly\" and a reviewer for The Heights wrote that \"I was expecting a great feminist work here, but got mediocrity. I cannot recommend that you see this film,\" though he nevertheless praised the film as a \"cornucopia of video spectacle [in which] Export delights, confounds and amuses the audience with her antics.\"\n\nParagraph 4: In July 1952, Fred Trosko was hired as head football coach at Michigan State Normal College. Trosko had been a star college running back at Michigan under head coach Fritz Crisler. The team improved markedly during Trosko's early years as head coach. In his first seven seasons, the team attained a record of 41–19–2, including a 7–1–1 record in 1953 and an 8–1–0 record in 1954. His teams won Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (\"IIAC\") championships in 1954 and 1957. The team's success came to an abrupt end in 1959. Trosko's teams had a 29-game winless streak (0–27–2) starting with the third game of the 1959 season and continuing through the fifth game of the 1962 season.  The precipitous decline followed the decision of the Eastern Michigan administration not to follow an IIAC policy that allowed member schools to award scholarships. Competing with non-scholarship athletes against conference schools with scholarship athletes, Trosko's Eastern Michigan teams were unable to compete.  In August 1965, Trosko announced his resignation as the school's head football coach, and it was reported that the resignation was the result of \"an apparent break with school administrators over policy.\" Trosko had the second longest tenure of any head coach at the school.  He also taught at Eastern Michigan and remained on the faculty at Eastern Michigan after retiring as football coach.  He ultimately retired in 1981 as a professor emeritus.  In 1982, he was inducted into the Eastern Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Jerry Raymond was the head football coach of the Hurons for the 1965 and 1966 seasons, and his coaching record at the school was 8 wins, 7 losses and 2 ties. As of the conclusion of the 2010 season, this ranks him No. 12 at Eastern Michigan in total wins and No. 13 at the school in winning percentage ().\n\nParagraph 5: In line with his understanding of the Akshar Purushottam Upasana, Gunatitanand Swami continued discoursing around Gujarat and along with his primary spiritual mission, helped initiate various social reforms throughout the region. In 1826, along with other prominent paramhansas, he laid the foundation stone of the Junagadh mandir. As one of the earliest Swaminarayan mandirs in the region, the mandir at Junagadh would go on to become a prominent center of learning and spiritual pilgrimage. Taking into account the socio-religious landscape of Junagadh, Swaminarayan decided to appoint Gunatitanand Swami as the mahant (religious and administrative head) due to his leadership abilities and experience. Gunatitanand Swami played a significant role in shaping the administration of Junagadh Mandir. His emphasis on listening to spiritual discourses and attaining spiritual knowledge became de rigueur for all aspirants. Furthermore, he encouraged devotional service as a means of putting the theory of the discourses into practice and insisted that everyone, regardless of social standing, engage in service. For many decades, even into his old age, Gunatitanand Swami would perform the menial task of sweeping the mandir courtyard himself despite being the head of the temple. Gunatitanand Swami served as the Mahant of Junagadh mandir for 40 years. It was during this time that Gunatitanand Swami met Pragji Bhakta, or Bhagatji Maharaj as he became known, regarded by the BAPS as his successor, . While Bhagatji Maharaj had initially served under Gopalanand Swami, he accepted Gunatitanand Swami as his guru after Gopalanand Swami told him that true liberation would only be possible through the Jogi of Junagadh (a reference to Gunatitanand Swami). Over a period of time, Bhagatji Maharaj's nuanced understanding and absolute realization of Gunatitanand Swami’s teachings, in particular the Akshar Purushottam Upasana became apparent to all. Furthermore his renunciation of worldly desires and strong adherence to the principles of ekantik dharma were a pivotal component of his relationship with Gunatitanand Swami who referred to him as \"someone who has profound faith and spiritual zeal\". According to the BAPS, Gunatitanand Swami would eventually install Bhagatji Maharaj as his successor and would often tell devotees that \"I have now handed over the key to Akshardham to Bhagatji Maharaj.”\n\nParagraph 6: Al Cohn - Al Haig - Alan Skidmore - Alec Dankworth - Andrew Cleyndert - Anita O’Day - Anita Wardell - Art Farmer - Arturo Sandoval - Barbara Dennerlein - Barney Kessel - Benn Clatworthy - Benny Carter - Benny Goodman - Bill Holman - Bill Perkins - Bill Watrous - Bobby Hutcherson - Bobby Shew - Bobby Wellins - Bob Wilber - Bosko Petrovic - Buddy Childers - Buddy DeFranco - Bud Shank - Carmen McRae - Charles McPherson - Charlie Mariano - Chet Baker - Chico Freeman - Chucho Valdes - Clark Terry - Conte Candoli - Count Basie - Dame Kiri Te Kanawa - Dave Green - David Gazarov - David Mowatt - Davide Petrocca - Dexter Gordon - Dick Morrissey - Dizzy Gillespie - Eddie Daniels - Eddie \"Lockjaw\" Davis - Ella Fitzgerald - Frank Rosolino - Frank Wess - Freddy Hubbard - Gareth Williams - Gene Harris - George Coleman - Georgie Fame - Gil Evans - Hank Jones - Harold Land - Harry \"Sweets\" Edison - Herb Ellis - James Moody - James Morrison - Jean Alain Roussel - Jim Hart - Jim Mullen - Jimmy Smith - Jimmy Witherspoon - J.J.

Powerful, innovative Puerto Rican leaders including Luis Muñoz Rivera, José de Diego, Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Luis Lloréns Torres, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi contributed to the rise of multiple successful political parties. However, the birth of multiple political groups led to a diversion of the island's interests: uniting as a statehood with the US, becoming a US territory commonwealth, or declaring independence altogether. In 1900, the  was formed during the US military rule of the island after the Spanish–American War. It was formed by Luis Munoz Rivera and other members of the Autonomist Party. The  favored immediate transformation of Puerto Rico into an organized unincorporated territory and eventually join US statehood. The  were founded by Santiago Iglesias Pantin. Over time the  was also in favor of statehood with the US. The  campaigned for assimilation into the United States and wanted to develop prosperously with their best interests under the new US administration. They wanted to fully integrate US law and government. Their plan was to become a territory and have representation through a delegate and eventually become a US state with no restrictions. The  did not advocate for independence. Instead party leader, Santiago Iglesias Pantin, advocated for statehood and change in economic policies which were influenced by his practice in founding the Federación Regional de Trabajadores (Regional Workers Federation) and labor newspaper Ensayo Obrero. The party was based on the principles of the Socialist Labor Party of America and received much support from American colonial authorities. After the dissolution of the Federal Party, Luis Muñoz Rivera and José de Diego founded the  in 1904. The Unionist Party of Puerto Rico aimed to secure “the right of Puerto Rico to assert its own personality, either through statehood or independence.” The beginning of the , the independence party, was in 1909. Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón, Manuel Zeno Gandía, Luis Lloréns Torres, Eugenio Benítez Castaño, and Pedro Franceschi founded the party which was the first political party whose agenda was the independence of Puerto Rico. Another change occurred during the year the party was founded. The Olmsted Amendment changed the Foraker Act, which was designed to switch the Puerto Rican government from a military one to a government ran by the civilians. Instead, the Olmsted act called for the government to be managed solely under the executive branch.\n\nParagraph 4: The château is located on the west side of the Canal de Caen à la Mer, on the southeast edge of the town of Bénouville, and just southwest of the Pegasus Bridge, made memorable on D-Day. During World War II the château/maternity hospital was run since 1935 by Madame Lea Vion surnamed 'la comtesse', director (from 1947-1953 she was even mayor of Benouville) who also led a resistance group of the GMO belonging to the réseau 'Centurie'. The maternity hospital became a hearth of resistance for the region. Fugitive Allied pilots and French youth unwilling to work for the Germans found a safe haven here. Weapons and a maquis-wireless transmitter were hidden here. Vion  was in frequent contact with resistance activists Leonard Gille, Rene Duchez and Henri Leveille. One of her informants was Georges Gondrée, the café owner near the bridge over the Caen Canal, who secretly collected information on German defences there for the benefit of D Company 2nd Ox and Bucks under Major John Howard who would storm the bridge successfully in the night before D-Day. Via Madame Vion this important information from Gondree was sent through to England. On D-Day morning soldier Wally Parr, a sniper from the Ox and Bucks, fired some rounds from a German 5 cm. anti tank-gun towards and over the château, because he erroneously thought German snipers to be present upon the roof of the building after he had seen 'something flickering'(most probably the fieldbinoculars of an observing  German Lieutenant). Major Howard made him stop this dangerous activity. Howard told Parr there were women in labour inside the chateau. At this very same moment, however, German Lieutenant Hans Hoeller, artillery officer from 8. Kompanie (Schwere Waffen), 192. Panzergrenadierregiment, Kampfgruppe Rauch, 21st Panzerdivision was standing on top of the château together with a sergeant and soldier in order to observe the canal bridge. Earlier Hans Hoeller had frustratingly found that his anti-tank troop could not pass through Benouville, because of too heavy resistance from British parachutists belonging to A Company, 7th Para Battalion under command of Nigel Taylor. He sought a suitable place to set up his batteries. Madame Vion had tried in vain to stop Lt. Hoeller from entering the \"chateau\". Hoeller and his colleagues were subsequently forced by Wally Parr's shelling to retreat downstairs immediately before opening their own fire on the Ox and Bucks defending the canal bridge nearby.\n\nParagraph 5: Jackson jokingly considered it a \"national anthem for the Nineties\", leading her to develop Rhythm Nation 1814, titled after the year \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was written.

In November that year she was promoted to Komsomol organizer of the 426th Infantry Regiment, which she served with for the remainder of her life. On 23 June 1944 her unit fought in the battle for Kireevo village in Vitebsk, where they had to crawl down when they approached an anti-tank ditch, where they came under intense machine-gun fire from nearby enemy bunkers. There, she became the first soldier to climb up a ladder from the ditch, telling her subordinates to follow her, and proceeded to attack the enemy machine-gun nest with a grenade, but was killed by machine-gun fire in the process.

After the attack she flagged down another vehicle passing by, and had the wounded soldiers transferred to that car and sent to Kalinin, where she was treated in the hospital for her injuries.

Starting off as a clerk in the headquarters of the 31st Army, she went on to become a political instructor at a field hospital before eventually getting a post on the front lines in March 1943 as the deputy commander for political affairs of the 221st Separate Communications Company; she was admitted to the Communist Party in 1942. While crossing the Vopets River in May 1943 she fell behind from the rest of her unit and lost her bearings; nevertheless, she crossed the river alone and was eventually able to establish communications.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Trenton Webb reviewed Requiem: Grim Harvest for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Requiem: Grim Harvest is a boxed set containing three booklets: Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem. Death Triumphant is the conclusion of the Grim Harvest campaign in which the player characters battle against Azalin, the Lich lord of Darkon. Necropolis is a geographical guide to the land where Death Triumphant is set. Requiem extrapolates from the party's position at the end of the campaign to create its own sub-game system. He quotes the George Romero zombie film line \"when Hell is full the dead will walk the earth\" and notes that with this \"This rather functional, if wonderfully horrific, philosophy [...] Requiem: Grim Harvest enables Ravenlofters to experience a world in which something spookily similar is occurring. And it's not very nice. Good fun, certainly, but not very nice.\" Webb comments that \"This three-book boxed set – Death Triumphant, Necropolis and Requiem - is an odd mix\" and notes that the Necropolis book would be useful \"so that after the adventure has run its (un)natural course the party can continue to romp around this most gothic of countries\", while \"Requiem, is a truly queer fish [...] and it is breathtakingly different.\" He comments on the adventure itself: \"As the final installment of the trilogy, Death Triumphant really delivers. Picking up the pace from the slightly more sedate second episode, the players are instantly thrown into conflict with the most powerful denizens of Ravenloft as they race against the clock to avert an apocalypse. With a heart-stopping (quite literally) midsection and an exciting closing chase, this adventure is a frantic and fitting climax to a truly excellent series.\" Webb comments that \"Necropolis is a good guide, crammed with fine and highly transportable adventure seeds. So even if you never run another Darkon adventure, you'll be able to plunder a few fine ideas and characters for other Ravenloft campaigns. The best of these being the absolutely ghastly Maggot Golem, which is pure Clive Barker and should definitely be used to turn players' stomachs the length and breadth of the land immediately.\" He comments that \"Requiem, however, presents many problems - not the least of which is that the sub-system evolves out of Death Triumphant'''s climax, and so by describing its basis the adventure's shocking twist would be ruined. Essentially, Requiem inverts one of the basic tenets of AD&D game mechanics with dramatic effects. The resultant system is elegant and well executed, although it does feel a little clinical and contrived at times. It would make an ideal holiday game when you're looking for a quick hit adventure with some temporary characters, but otherwise this fine design exercise doesn't really have the legs for long-term play.\" Webb concludes the review by saying \"The introduction of a boxed set at the endgame of a trilogy seems a little mercenary, especially when the first two episodes are so good that both players and referees will be desperate to see the campaign through to the end. But this climactic adventure is well worth the expense on its own. With the added benefit of some excellent adventure ideas in Necropolis and the curious Requiem system, you'd be mad not to inflict this most horrifying of sets on your players.\"\n\nParagraph 2: From 1882 through 1897 newspaper reports refer to this competition consistently as 'The Leinster Challenge Cup'. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as 'The Leinster Senior Cup'. How and why did this change in title come about? The change in reference title probably had more to do with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution \"that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read \"amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis\". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.\n\nParagraph 3: Green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, battery electric vehicles, compressed-air vehicles, hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles, neat ethanol vehicles, flexible-fuel vehicles, natural gas vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol.

He is the son of Dante Innocenti, a blacksmith who owned two hardware stores and a small ironmongery (Ferramenta Innocenti) where Ferdinando used to work. In 1923, he moved to Rome with his brother to grow their sales and they found there a booming construction industry boosted by the rise of fascism. The brothers sold metal pipes and scaffolding kits. In 1931, Innocenti opened a large factory in Rome and diversified the company's ventures. At the dawn of World War II, his company was awarded important contracts by the Ministry of War. His factories manufactured 17% of Italy’s total wartime production.\n\nParagraph 6: Ferdinando Innocenti grew up in Grosseto.

After her death, Bagapsh changed tactics, urging his supporters to leave the parliament building, but then to remain outside, in a similar tactic to that used successfully in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine several weeks later. Bagapsh's supporters then detained two presidential guards over Shakryl's death, and brought them to the prosecutor's office. Security forces loyal to outgoing president Vladislav Ardzinba (Khadjimba's mentor) subsequently launched a raid on the prosecutor's office and freed the two men. However, this only exacerbated tension, and resulted in the decision of 2,000 police members to refuse to follow government orders. In many ways as a result of this crisis, Khadjimba backed down several weeks later, agreeing to run as Bagapsh's deputy in a re-vote.\n\nParagraph 8: The name Cold Ash dates from the 16th century and is mentioned in a 1549 deed of settlement from John Winchcombe to his third son, Henry. During the English Civil War, troops camped on Cold Ash Common before taking part in the Second Battle of Newbury. The area was largely unpopulated before 1800 and consisted of moorland, the oldest part of the village is believed to be Bucklebury Alley. By the end of the 19th century, there were four principal landowners in Cold Ash and a large number of small tenanted dairy farms.  Cold Ash Convalescent Home and Children's hospital was opened by a nurse, Agnes Maria Bowditch, in her home in Cold Ash in 1886. By 1901, the hospital had expanded to accommodate 20 patients and specialised in respiratory illness. The hospital closed in 1964 and was demolished, the cul-de-sac, Sewell Close, was built in its place.\n\nParagraph 9: Trenton Webb reviewed Requiem: Grim Harvest for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: A hoard of 65 silver coins from the reign of King Stephen was found in the Sedgley Park area in 1972. The Prestwich manor emerged in the Middle Ages and in 1212 was assessed as four oxgang of land held by Adam de Prestwich whose father, Robert held it in 1193. The lord of the manor held the advowson for the church. Another Adam de Prestwich settled the manors of Prestwich, Alkrington and Pendlebury on his son John in 1297 but remarried and in 1313 settled the same manors on Thomas de Prestwich, his son by second wife. Thomas de Prestwich had daughters, Margaret who became a nun at Seaton Priory in 1360, but left the convent to marry Robert de Holland, and Agnes who married John de Radcliffe but died childless in 1362. Thomas de Prestwich granted his manors to Richard de Radcliffe for life and after that the manor was held by Richard de Langley. In 1371 Robert de Holland claimed the manor as the right of his wife. Roger de Langley was a minor and ward of the Duke of Lancaster in 1372 when Robert de Holland and a troop of armed men took possession of the manor by force and retained it until 1389. The Langleys regained the manor after 1403.\n\nParagraph 2: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols. One of the most celebrated of the latter was the temple at Uppsala in what is now called Old Uppsala, the centre of idolatrous worship not only for Sweden but for all Scandinavia. Even after Christianity had spread through Sweden, heathen sacrifices were still maintained at Uppsala. The \"Bishops' Chronicle\", written by Adam of Bremen in the years 1072–76, says, \"The Swedes have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala\", and \"Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of Sweden. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast ... More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become Christians must purchase exemption from participation in the feast ... The sacrifices are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by human beings; a Christian told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together.\"\n\nParagraph 3: In 1955, Franco was among a loose group of Leopoldville musicians that began working together under the auspices of the Loningisa studio; the group was known as Bana Loningisa (children of Loningisa).  In 1956, an original founding core of six of those musicians, with Franco as the sole guitarist, agreed to accept a regular, paid gig at the O.K. Bar, named after its owner, Oskar Kashama.  A few weeks later, needing a name for a contract, the band used OK Jazz, from the place it had begun (it has also been said that O.K. stood for Orchestre Kinois, or the band of Kinshasa), and they were \"baptized\" under that name at a June 6, 1956 show at the O.K. Bar.  While clarinetist Jean Serge Essous was the original leader of O.K. Jazz, Franco was a prolific songwriter; Essous called him a \"kind of genius\" for having written over a hundred songs in his notebooks at that time.  O.K. Jazz quickly became a rival to the leading established local band of that time, African Jazz under Joseph Kabasele. In December 1956, after some personnel changes, the new (and short-lived) lineup of O.K. Jazz released a rumba written by Franco' that would become the band's motto: \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\"\n\nParagraph 4: Honey and Billy's first attempt at getting married in June 2006 ends in disaster when Honey is admitted to hospital, due to food poisoning. They try again in July, but due to a series of unfortunate events — starting with a prank performed on Billy's stag night — the groom doesn't get to the ceremony on time. Their third attempt in September is arranged as a surprise by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Honey is heavily pregnant and goes into labour, during the ceremony. As Billy leans in for a kiss after they are pronounced husband and wife, Honey reveals that her waters have broken. Honey gives birth to a girl, Janet (named after Honey's mother), but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Janet has Down syndrome. Devastated, Honey rejects her baby, changing her name to Petal, as she does not have the \"perfect\" Janet she had wanted. Honey and Billy go to a support group for parents of children with Down syndrome, but this depresses Honey further. She breaks down and destroys Petal's nursery, admitting to Billy that she wants to put Petal up for adoption. Billy is against this and their relationship suffers as a result. Honey tries, but cannot accept her baby and at her lowest ebb, considers smothering Petal with a pillow, but cannot do it. Petal is fostered by Tony (Enzo Squillino, Jr.) and Kim Smith (Lorraine Arnold) in December 2006, but the next day, Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) tells Billy that Petal needs a heart operation. Billy arranges for Petal to be baptised in case she does not survive, and after reading a heartfelt letter from Billy to Petal, Honey decides to keep her daughter after all. She attends the baptism and informs the vicar that the baby's name is Janet.

The \"Bishops' Chronicle\", written by Adam of Bremen in the years 1072–76, says, \"The Swedes have a well-known heathen temple called Upsala\", and \"Every ninth year, moreover, a great feast is celebrated at Upsala, which is observed in common by all the provinces of Sweden. None is permitted to avoid participation in the feast ... More horrible than any punishment is that even those who have become Christians must purchase exemption from participation in the feast ... The sacrifices are made thus: Nine heads are offered for every living creature of the male sex. By the blood of these the gods are appeased. The bodies are hung up in a grove not far from the temple. Dogs and horses may be seen hanging close by human beings; a Christian told me he had seen seventy-two bodies hanging together.\"\n\nParagraph 7: A hoard of 65 silver coins from the reign of King Stephen was found in the Sedgley Park area in 1972. The Prestwich manor emerged in the Middle Ages and in 1212 was assessed as four oxgang of land held by Adam de Prestwich whose father, Robert held it in 1193. The lord of the manor held the advowson for the church. Another Adam de Prestwich settled the manors of Prestwich, Alkrington and Pendlebury on his son John in 1297 but remarried and in 1313 settled the same manors on Thomas de Prestwich, his son by second wife. Thomas de Prestwich had daughters, Margaret who became a nun at Seaton Priory in 1360, but left the convent to marry Robert de Holland, and Agnes who married John de Radcliffe but died childless in 1362. Thomas de Prestwich granted his manors to Richard de Radcliffe for life and after that the manor was held by Richard de Langley. In 1371 Robert de Holland claimed the manor as the right of his wife. Roger de Langley was a minor and ward of the Duke of Lancaster in 1372 when Robert de Holland and a troop of armed men took possession of the manor by force and retained it until 1389. The Langleys regained the manor after 1403.\n\nParagraph 8: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols.

In 1956, an original founding core of six of those musicians, with Franco as the sole guitarist, agreed to accept a regular, paid gig at the O.K. Bar, named after its owner, Oskar Kashama.  A few weeks later, needing a name for a contract, the band used OK Jazz, from the place it had begun (it has also been said that O.K. stood for Orchestre Kinois, or the band of Kinshasa), and they were \"baptized\" under that name at a June 6, 1956 show at the O.K. Bar.  While clarinetist Jean Serge Essous was the original leader of O.K. Jazz, Franco was a prolific songwriter; Essous called him a \"kind of genius\" for having written over a hundred songs in his notebooks at that time.  O.K. Jazz quickly became a rival to the leading established local band of that time, African Jazz under Joseph Kabasele. In December 1956, after some personnel changes, the new (and short-lived) lineup of O.K. Jazz released a rumba written by Franco' that would become the band's motto: \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\"\n\nParagraph 10: In 1955, Franco was among a loose group of Leopoldville musicians that began working together under the auspices of the Loningisa studio; the group was known as Bana Loningisa (children of Loningisa).

They try again in July, but due to a series of unfortunate events — starting with a prank performed on Billy's stag night — the groom doesn't get to the ceremony on time. Their third attempt in September is arranged as a surprise by Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Honey is heavily pregnant and goes into labour, during the ceremony. As Billy leans in for a kiss after they are pronounced husband and wife, Honey reveals that her waters have broken. Honey gives birth to a girl, Janet (named after Honey's mother), but her happiness is short-lived when she discovers that Janet has Down syndrome. Devastated, Honey rejects her baby, changing her name to Petal, as she does not have the \"perfect\" Janet she had wanted. Honey and Billy go to a support group for parents of children with Down syndrome, but this depresses Honey further. She breaks down and destroys Petal's nursery, admitting to Billy that she wants to put Petal up for adoption. Billy is against this and their relationship suffers as a result. Honey tries, but cannot accept her baby and at her lowest ebb, considers smothering Petal with a pillow, but cannot do it. Petal is fostered by Tony (Enzo Squillino, Jr.) and Kim Smith (Lorraine Arnold) in December 2006, but the next day, Dr. May Wright (Amanda Drew) tells Billy that Petal needs a heart operation. Billy arranges for Petal to be baptised in case she does not survive, and after reading a heartfelt letter from Billy to Petal, Honey decides to keep her daughter after all. She attends the baptism and informs the vicar that the baby's name is Janet. Janet's operation is a success, and Honey begins to bond with her.\n\nParagraph 13: When St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the North, went to Sweden in 829, the Swedes were still heathen and the country contained many sacrificial groves and temples for the worship of Germanic pagan idols.

This reputation has been contributed by media appearances after his first victory at the 2004 European Championships and silver medal at the World Championships and short relationship with former Miss France, Lætitia Bléger. He later brought a lawsuit against Bléger for 40,000 Euros for insinuating that he was homosexual and that their relationship was arranged to hide this. Bléger and two magazines that published her allegations were ordered by a French court to pay a total of 17,000 Euros, and to publish the court ruling in one of the two magazines. Joubert was later involved with Italian figure skater Valentina Marchei but the relationship ended by 2009.\n\nParagraph 3: A constitutional amendment creating an initiative system was passed by the state legislature and approved by voters in 1914, and was inserted into the constitution in 1916, as the legislature was required to wait until its next regular session to insert ratified constitutional amendments. The state Supreme Court upheld the referendum system in 1917, but overturned it in 1922, making it the first time the court ruled a constitutional amendment unconstitutional. Justice George H. Ethridge, whose vote change in the rulings swung the results, stated in 1925 that \"This system upsets our carefully worked out scheme for white control of the Legislature and the state officers\". In 1988, a group of state legislators made up of Oliver E. Diaz Jr., Isiah Fredericks, Stephen Hale, Ayres Haxton, Diane Peranich, John Reeves, Thomas Reynolds II, Ed Ryan, Margaret Tate, Dewayne Thomas, Rey Vecchio, and Bill Wheeler planned on bringing a test case to restore the referendum process. Their petition was for a referendum to hold a constitution convention to rewrite the state's constitution, but they failed to receive the required 7,500 signatures. The group submitted another petition with 8,100 signatures in 1990, to remove the constitution's ban on state lottery system and it was rejected by Secretary of State Dick Molpus. Attorney General Mike Moore filed a lawsuit against Molpus in Hinds County Circuit Court on March 28, to allow the referendum to appear on the ballot. Molpus supported the creation of a referendum system, but opposed the petition stating that the signature requirement was too low, as 7,500 signatures accounted for less than 1% of the voters, and instead supported having the signature requirement be 8% of registered voters. The circuit court ruled against Moore on June 29, and the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled unanimously to uphold its decision on April 3, 1991. State Senator Rick Lambert sponsored legislation supported by Molpus to create a referendum system that required signatures from equaled to 10% of the votes in the most recent gubernatorial election.\n\nParagraph 4: The religion arrived in the area during the end of the era of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the predecessor colonial country, under the Union of South Africa.  In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan termed the Ten Year Crusade.  During the plan pioneers moved to many countries including Botswana from places. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. The goal of establishing a Baháʼí presence in Bechuanaland was assigned to the National Assembly of Iran then still in operation. However, by November 1953 recent arrivals the Johnsons from America then in South Africa saw the arrival of John and Audrey Robarts and son Patrick and daughter Nina from Canada who were assisted in reaching Mafeking (then in Bechuanaland) as Baháʼí pioneers where they arrived by October 1954 and were recognized as the first Baháʼís to the country earning the title Knight of Baháʼu'lláh from the then head of the Faith, Shoghi Effendi. By 1963 there were two assemblies; seven groups, and one isolated member. The Robarts had joined the religion in 1938 and when the first National Spiritual Assembly of Canada was formed in 1948, John was elected chairman, a post he held until 1953 when they moved. In 1954 Hand of the Cause, Musa Banani appointed John as an Auxiliary Board Member and the family went on Baháʼí pilgrimage. In 2005 Lally Warren recalled that as a young child in Mafikeng it had been unusual to meet white people who were pleasant to her so she believed that all white people were bad. That changed when she met the Robarts family. \"The Robarts didn't treat me like a black child, they treated me as a child,\" she said. She recalled when she was 10 and the Robarts family came to her house for meetings with her parents, James and Stella Moncho, the first local couple to become Baháʼís, \"They could only do this at night, and as they came towards the house they would switch their [car] lights on and off to say, 'Is it ok, is it safe, can we come?'…There was no electricity in the black area during those days so my mother would take a lantern and stick it out through the window and wave it to say, 'OK, it's safe for you to come.'\"\n\nParagraph 5: In Te Arawa traditions, Chief Uenuku of Ra'iātea Island becomes annoyed with a dog named Pōtaka Tawhiti, the pet of Houmaitawhiti, for eating the leaked matter of Uenuku's ulcer, by which it commits an act of desecration. He kills the dog, after which Toi-te-huatahi consumes it. The ancestor Tamatekapua and his brother Whakatūria, sons of Houmai, search for the dog, and hear it barking inside Toi's belly. In revenge, they created stilts for Tama (the taller of the brothers) and stole the fruit from Uenuku's poroporo tree. Whakatūria was captured and hung from the roof of Uenuku's house, where the people would dance and sing around a fire below him every single night. Reportedly, their singing was so horrendously bad that the brothers, under the cover of darkness, came up with a clever way to trick the people into releasing him; the next opportunity he had, he told the people that their dancing and singing was terrible, and indeed they challenged him to do better, and let him down. He had them pamper him by cleaning the soot off and giving him some fine ornaments to dress himself in for the dance. He then tricked them into opening the door, so that he could feel the cool air, outside of which his brother Tama had arrived with two wooden poles to lock the people inside. Whakatūria manages to sprint through the open door, and the brothers bolt up the building from the outside. Uenuku declares war, and with his friend Toi he attacks the village of Houmai, but the forces of Uenuku were ultimately defeated. Whakatūria also fell in the battle, so the Arawa canoe was set out to New Zealand with one purpose being to search for meaning behind his death. At this time, the Tainui canoe was also on its way to New Zealand at this time. In this telling, Uenuku lived four generations after Ruatapu, who was one of Houmaitawhiti's ancestors.\n\nParagraph 6: In Te Arawa traditions, Chief Uenuku of Ra'iātea Island becomes annoyed with a dog named Pōtaka Tawhiti, the pet of Houmaitawhiti, for eating the leaked matter of Uenuku's ulcer, by which it commits an act of desecration.

The lower story is stone while the upper crenellated stories are made of brick.  The facade of the palace is curved slightly inwards (concave) to reflect the outwards curve (convex) of the Piazza del Campo, Siena's central square, of which the Palace is the focal point. At the top of this facade is a huge round flat bronze plate [Christogram], the symbol used by Saint Bernardino. It was placed there by the government in 1425 in gratitude to the great preacher, a native Sienese, for his sermons aimed at quelling social and political factionalism and unrest.\n\nParagraph 9: The Toronto hospital baby deaths occurred in the Cardiac Ward of the Hospital for Sick Children between July 1980 and March 1981. The deaths started after a cardiology ward had been divided into two new adjacent wards. The deaths ended after the police had been called in, and the digitalis-type medication that had possibly been used for the alleged killings (digoxin) had begun to be kept under lock and key. Three nurses were at the centre of the investigation and an apparent attempt to poison nurses' food. One of the nurses, Susan Nelles, was charged with four murders, but the prosecution was dismissed a year later on the grounds that she could not have been responsible for a death excluded in the indictment, which the judge deemed a murder.\n\nParagraph 10: The religion arrived in the area during the end of the era of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, the predecessor colonial country, under the Union of South Africa.

Ultraseven appears to fight a new foe, Alien Magma and his two \"pets\", the Red and Black Giras. Ultimately, Ultraseven is greatly overpowered and his leg is graphically broken by Black Giras. Ultraman Leo drives off the foes, but Ultraseven is confined to his human form because of his injuries and due to the Ultra Eye being damaged when he attempted to transform. Dan then maintains his role as Captain of MAC (Monster Attack Crew). Gen is a gymnastics teacher on the side and joins MAC to defend the Earth. Gen and Dan regularly train together, allowing Ultraman Leo to learn many moves in human form. In episode 34, Dan asks Ultraman Jack to take the Ultra Eye back to M78 to be restored while he heals on Earth. However, in episode 40 MAC is destroyed by Silver Bloome, a saucer monster that belongs to Commander Black. During the attack Dan asks Leo to keep defending the Earth and disappears in the conflagration. It is later shown that he was taken back to M78 to be fully healed and restored as Ultraseven. Gen is now unemployed and spends most of his time training the kids to defend themselves as well as defending the Earth as Ultraman Leo. Commander Black and Alien Bunyo capture Gen when he cannot transform completely. Gen as Leo is then dismembered, only to be brought back to life by Ultraman King. Leo would then face Commander Black's final monster, Black End, with the kids he trained, the latter of whom kill Black, and hand the sphere used to control Black End to Leo. Finishing his mission, Gen removes his Leo Ring and sets off to tour Earth, his \"second home\".\n\nParagraph 12: When the trio arrive at the office, on Corporation Street, Birmingham, with Holmes and Watson presented as fellow job-seekers, Pinner is reading a London newspaper and is clearly in shock.

Bléger and two magazines that published her allegations were ordered by a French court to pay a total of 17,000 Euros, and to publish the court ruling in one of the two magazines.

As they leave, he attempts suicide, but Watson is able to revive him. Holmes concludes that the story of the brothers is a fabrication and that there is only one 'Pinner'; lacking enough men to make their attempt to deceive Pycroft convincing, Pinner had attempted to pose as his brother to make up the numbers in the hope that Pycroft would dismiss the similarities between them as a family resemblance. He further deduces that the whole point of the exercise was to obtain an example of Pycroft's handwriting so that a 'fake' Pycroft may be employed at Mawsons (hence why they asked him to not officially resign his post). Mawsons was keeping a vast stock of valuable securities, and 'Pycroft' was to be a safebreaker.", "answers": ["9"], "length": 3516, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "558eb0f077b73689c0ebdecd6835412bea8d7c84cba3e834"}

She was a heavy favorite to win the crown from the semifinal to final. During the semifinals on August 5, 1990, she won the Miss Photogenic award. She had a semifinal score of 485, placing 3rd overall. The finals were held on August 21, 1990. She eventually beat out another big favorite, Helen Yung who was 1st runner up and the winner of 2 other awards. Yuen later represented Hong Kong at the Miss Chinese International 1991 pageant, held on February 2, 1991. She took 1st runner up for Hong Kong. She also competed at the Miss Universe 1991 pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada. She failed to make the top 10 and was placed 60th.\n\nParagraph 6: This program started in 1983 and a curriculum was developed for Class I to Class V based on inferences from social, linguistic and mathematical surveys and field tests conducted in field area. The curriculum focused on various aspects of education like child development, language learning, mathematical abilities, etc. and was phased in a sequential manner on a hierarchy derived from a Piagetian framework of development of logical and mathematical abilities. The programme also gave special emphasis on the socio-economic and cultural tradition of learner and the state of the schools. The pilot project was started in 1987 in 7 schools across Shahpura and Harda. This number further increased to 25 in 1989. The programme was formally inducted into a state programme under the District Primary Education Programme DPEP of Rajiv Gandhi Prathamik Shiksha Mission (RGPSM) of Madhya Pradesh in 1995. The learning from the trial was further used to develop RGPSM's Seekhna Sikhana curricular package for primary education. This was then followed by a single primary school curricular package for the entire state which stemmed from the Seekhna Sikhana package and this also helped in the development of a curriculum for the ‘alternative’ primary schools opened by the Madhya Pradesh government under the Education Guarantee Scheme (EGS). One can say that the ultimate objective of Prashika programme was achieved when the Seekhna Sikhana package was adopted in 2001. Thus, the Prashika was the first of Eklavya's programmes to complete the cycle from a micro-level pilot project (1986–92) to a macro-level programme implemented at a block level (1995-2001) that was eventually merged into the government school system (2000–01) at the state level. However the scope of this programme remained confined to the block as this programme was soon closed down by the state government. But that was not the end of Prashika as it laid foundation for two more similar programmes, the first was the establishment of Shiksha Protsahan Kendras (SPKs) in Shahpur block in 1999 and the second was the setting up of the Bhopal Education Resource Centre (BERC) in 2000. SPKs are centres which operate in rural areas especially in the tribal areas to improve the quality of education of first generation learners through activity based learning. This centre is being run by a community appointed facilitator and adopts the principles developed under PRASHIKA for math and language teaching. BERC is a resource centre in an urban setting for primary and pre-primary education. The main goal of BERC is to encourage primary schools to introduce various activities that would develop interest in reading, writing and expression skills in students, through the production of wall newspaper and renovation of their libraries. In the Makhan Nagar block of Narmadapuram a Basic Abilities Programme was started in some middle schools. Teachers participation was the backbone of this programme. In 2004 a new initiative was also started in Indore as part of the teacher development initiative of the Indore Teacher Resource Centre to improve the abilities of primary school teachers in language and mathematics.\n\nParagraph 7: Melton appeared three times as Harry Cooper in the 1955–56 sitcom It's Always Jan.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch. The two subsidiary platforms each had a waiting room, while the main platform building contained the waiting room, ticket and luggage offices.  Next to the footbridge was a separate W.H. Smith bookstall. The station master's house was separate, being beside the track to the north, and there was small luggage store just outside the gate. The Wirksworth branch having severed the main road, which had been diverted, a footbridge gave access across the line. To the north of the station, there was a wide level crossing which, besides allowing luggage trolleys to cross, gave access for the farmer who owned the adjacent land. Next to this was a footbridge from the front of the station to the field behind, and between them two signal posts with, until 1910, a Duffield Station signal box supplementing Duffield Junction. After that, the station changed little over the years until 1969 though in 1947, at the time passenger services were withdrawn on the Wirksworth branch, the signal posts were replaced with a fabricated steel gantry and upper-quadrant signals. Some time later the passenger footbridge was rebuilt in brick, using the existing walkway.\n\nParagraph 2: The tower marks the location of Edison's Menlo Park laboratory, the world's first organized research and development site. He came to Menlo Park in 1876. The area was then known as Raritan Township, and later changed (in 1954) to Edison Township. Menlo Park is known as the Birthplace of Recorded Sound (November 1877), and the site of the world's first practical incandescent lamp-light bulb (October 1879).  Edison and his staff would create 400 of his most important inventions here.  It was this site that Edison would fondly nickname his 'Invention Factory'.  Edison and his staff were working in New York City, building the world's first central distribution site for electricity, when his wife Mary Stilwell Edison died at their Menlo Park home.   He would later relocate to West Orange, New Jersey in 1884 to what is now the Thomas Edison National Historical Park.  The original Menlo Park buildings began to deteriorate, and by 1926 most of the buildings had either collapsed or burned, and the only two remaining buildings were later moved to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. The Thomas A. Edison Memorial Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1979 as an important architectural and commemorative landmark.\n\nParagraph 3: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay.

A collision with His Majesty's tug Dreadful at the entrance to Berehaven Harbour, Ireland, the night of 1 January 1918, damaged Patterson's bow but she resumed regular escort and patrol on 5 February. Two days later she rescued 12 survivors of steamship Mexico City, torpedoed by a German submarine. Patterson, patrolling in the Irish Sea on 17 May, dropped depth charges that drove away German . She continued patrol out of Queenstown until 4 June, then departed for the United States.\n\nParagraph 6: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch. The two subsidiary platforms each had a waiting room, while the main platform building contained the waiting room, ticket and luggage offices.  Next to the footbridge was a separate W.H. Smith bookstall. The station master's house was separate, being beside the track to the north, and there was small luggage store just outside the gate. The Wirksworth branch having severed the main road, which had been diverted, a footbridge gave access across the line. To the north of the station, there was a wide level crossing which, besides allowing luggage trolleys to cross, gave access for the farmer who owned the adjacent land. Next to this was a footbridge from the front of the station to the field behind, and between them two signal posts with, until 1910, a Duffield Station signal box supplementing Duffield Junction. After that, the station changed little over the years until 1969 though in 1947, at the time passenger services were withdrawn on the Wirksworth branch, the signal posts were replaced with a fabricated steel gantry and upper-quadrant signals. Some time later the passenger footbridge was rebuilt in brick, using the existing walkway.\n\nParagraph 7: It is also the name of a Canadian military and civilian telecommunication research campus that is located on the shore of the bay. Organizations with facilities at the site include Defence Research and Development Canada, Communications Research Centre, the Canadian Space Agency's David Florida Laboratory, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Firearms Training Unit, Department of Defence firearms training area, and the Connaught National Army Cadet Summer Training Centre. In October 1952, the Canadian government set up an observatory at the site to attempt to measure magnetic or radio noise disturbances. The area includes the Innis Point Bird Observatory and the Shirley's Bay Crown Game Preserve, which is managed by the Ottawa Duck Club.\n\nParagraph 8: The tower marks the location of Edison's Menlo Park laboratory, the world's first organized research and development site. He came to Menlo Park in 1876. The area was then known as Raritan Township, and later changed (in 1954) to Edison Township. Menlo Park is known as the Birthplace of Recorded Sound (November 1877), and the site of the world's first practical incandescent lamp-light bulb (October 1879).  Edison and his staff would create 400 of his most important inventions here.  It was this site that Edison would fondly nickname his 'Invention Factory'.  Edison and his staff were working in New York City, building the world's first central distribution site for electricity, when his wife Mary Stilwell Edison died at their Menlo Park home.   He would later relocate to West Orange, New Jersey in 1884 to what is now the Thomas Edison National Historical Park.  The original Menlo Park buildings began to deteriorate, and by 1926 most of the buildings had either collapsed or burned, and the only two remaining buildings were later moved to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan. The Thomas A. Edison Memorial Tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1979 as an important architectural and commemorative landmark.\n\nParagraph 9: At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge, the second being an island between the two passenger lines, and another for the branch.

Ever since Zanjeer, Salim–Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as Deewaar (1975) and Sholay (1975), establishing Bachchan as a superstar. In addition to being a turning point for Bachchan's career and Hindi cinema, Zanjeer was also a turning point for South Indian cinema, with Bachchan's acting inspiring future Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth. Zanjeer remains an important film in the history of Indian cinema and is regarded as a classic today. Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Raaj Kumar, and Dharmendra were offered the lead role, but they did not accept the role. It is a matter of common knowledge that it was the romantic era of Rajesh Khanna. Romance was on the rise and Zanjeer did not have a single romance scene between the lead pair Amitabh and Jaya. All actors who refused the film had a serious concern about a dent in their image if they did this film. Bachchan, on the other hand, had little to lose; he chose the film and started his way to superstardom.\n\nParagraph 11: Nicole gives Chase a makeover so that he fits in better with her friend group and takes him to events where he becomes friends with the popular kids, all while insisting to his old friends, Dave and Ray, that the whole thing is just a scam and that he hasn't really changed, though it's clear to them that he has.  While Chase does all the activities Nicole asks him to with little resistance, he eventually points out that everything they've done is for her benefit.  Nicole agrees to do whatever he wants and they go to a club he used to frequent with Dulcie, where Nicole has a good time and begins bonding with his friends. Chase has a run in with Dulcie and her new boyfriend, Nicole comes to his aid and kisses him, which makes Dulcie jealous. Nicole and Chase begin to fall in love but don't admit their feelings, to each other or themselves, and continue their ruse.  Nicole's vindictive best friend, Alicia, seduces Chase at a party, making sure Nicole would see them together, leaving Nicole heartbroken. Chase calls Dave to pick him up, since he is too drunk to drive, and angers Dave when he says that \"everyone\" was at the party, which Dave says is not true because he and Ray were not there, reminding him they used to be his friends. Meanwhile, Brad and his girlfriend break up and Dulcie also ends things with her new boyfriend. Chase attempts to talk to Nicole about what happened with Alicia but she rebuffs him, reminding him of the easy out clause, she also ignores his calls. Chase eventually makes up with his friends and gets back together with Dulcie. Brad finally asks Nicole to the dance. Despite getting what they both wanted from the beginning, Chase is unhappy with Dulcie and Nicole rejects Brad.", "answers": ["10"], "length": 2028, "dataset": "passage_count_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "b840b98f785681073e1294d070f22aef0fbffd88593251b7"}
{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Under Napoleonic rule (1806 to 1813), Frankenberg was home to the seat of a canton in the department of Werra in the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1821, Frankenberg became district seat (Kreisstadt) of the newly formed district of Frankenberg, consisting of the former Ämter of Frankenberg, Hessenstein, Rosenthal and Haina, along with the court district of Viermünden. The district council – after 1834 provincial council – had its seat in the St. Georgenberg Monastery. Frankenberg had sunk down from a key town to an unnotable, mean little town. Its economic underpinnings, as had already been so in the Middle Ages, were the clothiers and the tanners. Whereas by the late 18th century the woolmen's and clothiers' guild had 106 members and the tanners' guild 46, by the middle of the 19th century, membership in the woolmen's and clothiers' guild rose to 140, and red and white tanning blossomed once again. Alongside other guilds, there was also at that time a stocking weavers' and glovers' guild. In the second half of the century, a noticeable downswing set in, which could even be seen in population figures (2,611 in 1787, 3,163 in 1867 and 2,787 in 1894). From 1590 to 1818, copper and silver ore was mined and smelted near Frankenberg. During the 19th century, various attempts were undertaken to get the mining industry running again, but in 1875, it was abandoned for good. Sights between Frankenberg and Geismar still bear witness today to the mining in days of yore, as do some placenames such as \"Alte Hütte\" (\"Old Ironworks\"), \"Neue Hütte\" (\"New Ironworks\") and \"Zechenhaus\" (\"Colliery House\"). Only when the railway reached Frankenberg did a new economic upswing, albeit a modest one, come to the town. In 1890, the Marburg-Frankenberg line was opened, and the Brothers Thonet from Vienna furthermore set up a chair-making factory near the railway station making use of the wealth of wood in the area. Ten years later, the line was extended through Korbach to Warburg, making connections to Westphalia. In 1908, the stretch of line to Bestwig was completed, and in 1910, so was the one to Berleburg.\n\nParagraph 2: Newlands is best known for his work interpreting the love of God, particularly a Christology of divine love. In Hilary of Poitiers: a Study in Theological Method (1978), Newlands argues for concepts of love as the key to exegesis in theology. In Theology of the Love of God (1980), Newlands takes concepts of the love of God to be the basic structuring element of Christian theology. Newlands engages interpretations of love in the Christian tradition and contemporary uses of concepts of faith, hope, and history, and proposes that the nature of God as love shapes every aspect of theology. In God in Christian Perspective (1994), Newlands's argument is developed further. An understanding of God as a multi-faceted model draws on Christology and Trinity, and faith and practice in community. God is personal, self-differentiated being, transcendent, yet also immanent in the created order as hidden divine presence. The core elements of theology (faith and revelation, divine action and Christology) are reappraised in the light of current theological proposals. Doctrines, Newlands argues, interact in a web of connection to shape Christian practice. A Christian understanding, however, must retain a basic core of unconditional love, Christologically characterised. A contemporary concept of God draws upon these core elements, and upon a retrieval of the historical traditions from which they arise. It can be articulated in language intelligible to contemporary citizens, and its consequences spelled out within the complexity of contemporary cultures. Generosity and the Christian Future (1997) carries this thesis to a further stage through engagement with emancipatory theologies, postmodernity, and political theory. John and Donald Baillie: Transatlantic Theology (2002),  built on first access to the Baillie Papers, lies at the heart of Newlands's constructive proposal. Newlands takes the work of John Baillie and Donald Ballie as seminal to the understanding, justification and revisioning of a progressive Christian theology. This tradition is a trajectory against the stream of contemporary theology. In  The Transformative Imagination: Rethinking Intercultural Theology (2004), Newlands offers a comparative study of connections between theology and culture, through the arts, the sciences, political and human rights issues, and shapes reflection on the mystery of God in a postfoundational frame.\n\nParagraph 3: From 1990 until 1992, Estrada served as Assistant U.S. Attorney and Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section, U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: The Daughters of Israel - Home for the Incurables was the organization from which the original opening hospital derived its name from. In May 1926 it was announced by Max Blumberg, the President of the organization, the hospital was to be named The Jewish Sanitarium for Incurables. The original name of the hospital represented the very nature of the patients the organization and its founder were seeking to admit. During the period of 1926 to 1936 the media outlet occasionally referred to the hospital as the Jewish Home for Incurables, and the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronics and Incurables. By the mid-1930s the hospital recognized there was no longer the need to emphasize the position as only harboring terminal and incurable patients and therefore decided to officially change its name. on May 17, 1936, the hospital changed its name to the Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases. The announcement came from Bernard Lebovitz, the Vice President at the time, during the dedication ceremonies of a new 40-bed ward. In a speech addressing the name change Mr. Lebovitz stated \" Only a Few years ago, hospitals and doctors were in the habit of giving up many patients and deciding that medial science could do nothing more for them, but no cases are given up as hopeless nowadays\". He went on to say \" Patients in the Sanitarium suffer from severe cancer, paralysis, heart disease, and 45 other diseases from which patients rarely recover all live in the hope that medical science will one day discover a cure for their ailment\". On July 8, 1954, Isaac Albert announced that The Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases had changed its name to Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. \"This change is in keeping with the services which the institution renders. The term 'Sanitarium' connotes a rest or convalescent home or institution.\". By the mid-1950s the Jewish Chronic Disease hospital was an 810-bed institution dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, polio, and heart conditions. It became the nation's largest voluntary, non-sectarian hospital for chronically sick and had patients ranging in age from infants to aged men and women. It had facilities for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, inpatient and outpatient cerebral palsy clinics, a rheumatic fever division, cardiology division, medical research laboratories, tumor detection clinic, and other departments for the treatment and study of long-term ailments. For many years, while the institution was known as the 'Home for Incurables.\" Mr. Albert pointed out. \"Today, however, the hospital is endeavoring to be an interim point between physical rehabilitation and discharge, now 'A Haven of Hope'.\" On May 21, 1968, the hospital was renamed yet again to the current name Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center at the annual anniversary dinner for the hospital. In 2010 the hospital attained corporate status effectively becoming a separate entity from the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. The Corporation of Kingsbrook Medical Center system to govern these bodies. This change caused Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center to go from an 864-bed facility to 326 beds splitting the remaining 538 beds to the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. It is of note that even though these two facilities are by definition separate they still share many services and protocols.\n\nParagraph 2: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\" under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, René Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area.\n\nParagraph 3: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth. Through clever persuasion and trickery, Nelvanna bargained with Tundra to strip her of her godly powers so that she could pass through the barrier to find and mate with a male human of Earth. Nelvanna appeared before a man named Richard Easton, insisting upon mating with him to produce a child who would grow to battle the evil, mystical \"Great Beasts\" of Canada. Easton reluctantly agreed, and the two conceived Snowbird some time in the early 20th century, near Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada. Years later, after having been driven mad by his experiences in the spirit realm, Easton worked a spell to summon and control Tundra and was horribly burned up by the completion of the summoning. He only controlled Tundra for a brief period, and Tundra's manifestation was destroyed by Marrina.\n\nParagraph 4: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth.

He only controlled Tundra for a brief period, and Tundra's manifestation was destroyed by Marrina.\n\nParagraph 5: Several thousand years before Snowbird's birth, the immensely powerful and malevolent Arctic spirit Tundra sealed the Northern gods — including the Inuit goddess Nelvanna — within a mystical barrier in another dimension, rendering them incapable of defending the mortal realm of Earth. Through clever persuasion and trickery, Nelvanna bargained with Tundra to strip her of her godly powers so that she could pass through the barrier to find and mate with a male human of Earth. Nelvanna appeared before a man named Richard Easton, insisting upon mating with him to produce a child who would grow to battle the evil, mystical \"Great Beasts\" of Canada.

In May 1926 it was announced by Max Blumberg, the President of the organization, the hospital was to be named The Jewish Sanitarium for Incurables. The original name of the hospital represented the very nature of the patients the organization and its founder were seeking to admit. During the period of 1926 to 1936 the media outlet occasionally referred to the hospital as the Jewish Home for Incurables, and the Jewish Sanitarium for Chronics and Incurables. By the mid-1930s the hospital recognized there was no longer the need to emphasize the position as only harboring terminal and incurable patients and therefore decided to officially change its name. on May 17, 1936, the hospital changed its name to the Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases. The announcement came from Bernard Lebovitz, the Vice President at the time, during the dedication ceremonies of a new 40-bed ward. In a speech addressing the name change Mr. Lebovitz stated \" Only a Few years ago, hospitals and doctors were in the habit of giving up many patients and deciding that medial science could do nothing more for them, but no cases are given up as hopeless nowadays\". He went on to say \" Patients in the Sanitarium suffer from severe cancer, paralysis, heart disease, and 45 other diseases from which patients rarely recover all live in the hope that medical science will one day discover a cure for their ailment\". On July 8, 1954, Isaac Albert announced that The Jewish Hospital and Sanitarium for Chronic Diseases had changed its name to Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital. \"This change is in keeping with the services which the institution renders. The term 'Sanitarium' connotes a rest or convalescent home or institution.\". By the mid-1950s the Jewish Chronic Disease hospital was an 810-bed institution dedicated to the treatment and rehabilitation patients with chronic diseases such as cancer, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, polio, and heart conditions. It became the nation's largest voluntary, non-sectarian hospital for chronically sick and had patients ranging in age from infants to aged men and women. It had facilities for occupational therapy, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, inpatient and outpatient cerebral palsy clinics, a rheumatic fever division, cardiology division, medical research laboratories, tumor detection clinic, and other departments for the treatment and study of long-term ailments. For many years, while the institution was known as the 'Home for Incurables.\" Mr. Albert pointed out. \"Today, however, the hospital is endeavoring to be an interim point between physical rehabilitation and discharge, now 'A Haven of Hope'.\" On May 21, 1968, the hospital was renamed yet again to the current name Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center at the annual anniversary dinner for the hospital. In 2010 the hospital attained corporate status effectively becoming a separate entity from the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. The Corporation of Kingsbrook Medical Center system to govern these bodies. This change caused Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center to go from an 864-bed facility to 326 beds splitting the remaining 538 beds to the David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute/ Rutland Nursing Home. It is of note that even though these two facilities are by definition separate they still share many services and protocols.\n\nParagraph 7: In 1968, Chilean artist Eduardo Armstrong introduced the children's magazine Mampato, a bi-weekly publication containing educational articles as well as prose stories and a number of Chilean and foreign comic strips, which was published by Editorial Lord Cochrane. The first episode of the titular Mampato comic series was initially written by Armstrong and illustrated by Óscar Vega, a renowned Chilean comics artist. It tells the story of a young Chilean boy who obtains a \"space-time belt\" and uses it to travel through time, seeking to experience history's greatest adventures. The character of Mampato was partly inspired by both Dennis the Menace by Hank Ketcham, and Goscinny and Uderzo's Astérix. Vega had just read an Astérix book, at the time little known in Latin America, and was very impressed with the work; he attempted to merge Dennis the Menace's physical appearance and Astérix' art style into Mampato. Themo Lobos was then very busy with his work for El Peneca, yet Armstrong offered him the chance to illustrate Mampato. At first, Lobos declined the offer, but after a while he accepted – quickly becoming close friends with Armstrong. Lobos began drawing the series from the third chapter of Mampato's first adventure. While doing the illustrations, he mentioned to Armstrong that he was uncomfortable working with a script he had not written. Armstrong then decided to give Lobos free reins for the creation of stories and characters in all subsequent Mampato comics. For the remainder of the first storyline and, in full instalments since the second Mampato adventure (\"Kilikilis and Golagolas\"), the series was entirely written and illustrated by Lobos (save for a few storylines by Vega) and the magazine went on to become highly popular and successful with Chilean youth, at its peak selling roughly 100,000 copies per issue and changed its schedule to weekly in April 1971.\n\nParagraph 8: Juan Carlos Caballero Mistral (Jaime Camil) is a busy  man working in Grupo Imperio. He is a womanizer who can never get enough. Juan feels he just enjoys the company of women. Everyone in the industry feels he is just a man who plays with women's feelings. But when Helena Moreno Romero (Lucero), a single mother of one son and an ex-employee of Grupo Imperio, enters Juan Carlos' life, he begins to have feelings for Helena, something he has never felt before. Helena regains her position at Grupo Imperio and starts a huge project. They fall helplessly in love with each other and plan to marry and start a family with Helena's son Eduardo (Lalito). Although, given his background, Helena hates Juan Carlos Caballero and Juan Carlos pretends he is Juan Perón, son of an Argentinian ambassador. Helena finds this out and is heartbroken. She feels Juan tricked her and was looking for another \"adventure,\"and also feels he tried to steal the project she had been working hard on.  Later Plutarco Ramos Arrieta (Marcelo Cordoba) frames him for embezzlement. While in his car, Juan Carlos hears the police sirens.  He is chased by the police until he falls of a cliff and his car explodes. Thinking he is dead, the authorities publicize the message that Juan Carlos is dead. Helena is mourning and feels she will never forget her great love for him. Meanwhile, Juan Carlos is still alive but in hiding. He meets Mimi de La Rosa (Patricia Navidad) and they become extraordinary friends. He tells her his whole story and how he must clear his name. Mimi helps him transform from Juan Carlos Caballero to Eva Maria Leon Jaramillo viuda de Zuloaga. He watches out for Helena and her son while trying to find evidence to clear his name. Although it becomes a very different and difficult life being a lady, Juan Carlos starts to realize his mistake and the consequences of being a womanizer. Eva/Juan applies for a job as Helena's assistant. She/he gets the job and at first, does not get along well with Helena. But soon they become the best of friends. Plutarco falls in love with Helena and becomes Juan's (biggest) enemy. Plutarco proposes to Helena, and Helena accepts. Although Plutarco had a wife, Antonia Reyes de Ramos (Christina Pastor) who died of a heart attack, he also has an ex-lover, Rebeca Oropeza (Mariana Seoane). Rebeca becomes his worst enemy; she is determined to ruin their relationship. But Juan is crushed and gives Helena every reason to hate Plutarco. As Eva, Juan will regain Helena's love, clear his name and realize his dream of being married and having a family with her.\n\nParagraph 9: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931. He studied biology at McGill University and then emigrated to the UK, under a Rhodes Scholarship for studying mathematics at Oxford. He got his PhD at the University of Edinburgh presenting the thesis \"Studies in the general theory of development and evolution\" under the supervision of Conrad Hal Waddington. He then moved to Sussex University until 1983 when he became a full professor at the Open University in Milton Keynes until retirement in 1992. He became a major figure in the early development of mathematical biology, along with other researchers. He was one of the attendants to the famous meetings that took place between 1965 and 1968 in Villa Serbelloni, hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation, under the topic \"Towards a theoretical Biology\". The workshop involved, among other key scientists, Conrad Waddington, Jack Cowan, Michael Conrad, Jim Burns, Christopher Zeeman, Richard Lewontin, Robert Rosen, Stuart Kauffman, John Maynard Smith, René Thom and Lewis Wolpert. As a result of the conference talks and discussions, a four-volume proceedings of the event came out, becoming at the time a major reference in the area.\n\nParagraph 10: Brian Goodwin was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1931.

{"input": "", "context": "Paragraph 1: Corrour station was built by the West Highland Railway between 1893 and 1894 on its line linking Glasgow with Fort William, and was operated from its opening on 7 August 1894 by the North British Railway. It has a passing loop around an island platform with a siding on the east side. In common with the line's two other remote passing places, Gorton and Glen Douglas, it was built with a tall signalbox and an adjacent low building in which the signalman lived. The adjacent low building (in Corrour's case) was also used as a sub post office from 15 December 1896 and a Post Office telegraph office from 16 August 1898; Corrour even qualified as a post town. Later, the railway constructed a station house for the signalman on the east side of the tracks, and the original building became purely office accommodation for the railway and the post office.\n\nParagraph 2: Harvey Swick is an 11-year-old boy bored with school, teachers, homework, and his day-to-day life. A man named Rictus visits Harvey and tells him about a kids’ paradise called the Holiday House. At the Holiday House, there are all the sweets a person could ask for; four seasons in a day; Halloween every evening; Christmas, with whatever gifts you could wish for every night; and everything else you could dream of. Harvey hesitantly visits the house and becomes friends with two other children staying alongside him, Wendell and Lulu. There is also an elderly woman, Mrs. Griffin, who cooks all the meals and cares for the children; though she seems kind, she appears to be keeping a secret about the house and its creator, Mr. Hood. Mrs Griffin also keeps three cats: Stew Cat, Blue Cat and Clue Cat. Clue Cat is accidentally killed by being burned alive from the lunch Mrs Griffin had been cooking, which distresses her. Harvey thinks his parents will be worried about him, so is allowed to speak to them on the phone. Harvey’s parents tell him they thought it would be a good idea for him to take a break from school to cheer him up. Though Harvey thinks the voices of his parents are a bit strange, he brushes it off and starts to relax. \n\nParagraph 3: Bumblebee's next adventure would occur when he accompanied Spike and Sparkplug with Jazz to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so they wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee returned to the headquarters, he saw nobody but Bluestreak there and that Teletraan One was damaged. He then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Teletraan One, he, Bumblebee, Jazz and Spike learn about what happened. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who were not affected from the personality destabilizer, Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime, Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons' control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Prime. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells Prime that he is not evil, and he believes in him, then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, which freed him from Decepticon control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Prime for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus Prime, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they needed to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control.\n\nParagraph 4: Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"First offering from rapper's major-label debut, Mack Daddy, cheekily rhapsodizes about the joys of women with prominent backsides.

In Old English, inflections increased the length of most content words in any case.  Through to the seventeenth century, before English spelling was firmly settled, short forms for some content words did occur, such as eg (egg), ey (eye), lo (low), etc.  Conversely, poets alternated between short and long forms for function words, depending on whether they occurred on or off the meter. Some commentators have ascribed such a convention to John Milton, although others suggest that it was unevenly implemented and clouded by intervention from the printer.\n\nParagraph 7: The first season of Australia's Brainiest Kid was produced in May 2004, airing on the Seven Network on Sundays, starting 28 November 2004.

In the most recent version of Grove's Dictionary,  states that: \"Although these pieces have been severely criticized by modern writers as primitive, the appearance of a second part suggests they were popular in their time.\" The musicologist Peter Williams has compared settings of Vetter's with Bach's short chorale preludes from Orgelbüchlein, which date from exactly the same period: according to Williams, Vetter's treatments were \"competent but jejune\". As a specific comparison, Williams has taken the first chorale Nun komm der Heiden Heiland: for him Vetter's clavichord or spinet setting as a French prélude is less convincing then Bach's setting BWV 599; \"the opening chorale’s expressive tmesis or semiquaver break in the melody of bar 1, imitated in the following alto and tenor, was the result of second thoughts—a tiny but clear example of creative thinking, and typical of the album.\" Writing from the perspective of Bach's biography, Williams suggests that \"J. S. Bach wished to surpass Vetter in his own work.\"  also compares the two treatments of Nun komm der Heiden Heiland by Vetter and Bach. He states that whereas \"Bach makes the chord-breaking into a contrapuntal figure that pushes the texture forward and creates constant variety\", Vetter's uniform and automatic resort to broken-chord figures is \"astounding\". As Rose comments, this predictability led Gotthold Frotscher in the 1930s to accuse Vetter of \"lacking creative power\" in these works. Rose and  have examined the anthology in the context of late seventeenth– and early eighteenth–century music-making and domestic worship in Germany: the chorales were aimed at the pious merchant class in Leipzig, with simple four-point settings for organ coupled with clavichord or spinet broken-chord settings in the fashionable luthé or brisé style. The preface to Vetter's second volume states that no great degree of proficiency was required for performers of his chorales; nevertheless, even the highly accomplished keyboard player Anna Amalia, the sister of Frederick the Great, had a copy of Vetter's chorales in her personal library.  outlines the relevance of Vetter's 1713 second preface in the role of Lutheran worship, where Vetter explains \"the spiritual benefits of music, especially the practice of singing hymns after meals, and does so by reference to Luther.\" Leaver infers that Bach's use of Vetter's final chorale Liebster Gott for the 1724 cantata BWV 8, \"implies that he had probably read Vetter’s preface referring to Luther.\"\n\nParagraph 13: The son of a butcher from County Durham, Reed began performing at the end of World War II, joining the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1951.
