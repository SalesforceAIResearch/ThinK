{"input": "Passage:\nCostermonger\nCostermonger, coster, or costard is a street seller of fruit and vegetables, in London and other British towns. Costermongers were ubiquitous in mid-Victorian England, and some are still found in markets. As usual with street-sellers, they would use a loud sing-song cry or chant to attract attention. The costermonger's cart might be stationary at a market stall, or mobile (horse-drawn or wheelbarrow).  The term is derived from the words costard (a now extinct medieval variety of large, ribbed apple) and monger (seller).\n\nCosters met a need for rapid food distribution from the central markets (e.g., Smithfield for meat, Spitalfields for fruit and vegetables or Billingsgate for fish). Their membership as a coster was signalled by their large neckerchief, known as a kingsman, tied round their necks. Their hostility towards the police was legendary. \n\nThe term is now often used to describe hawkers in general;  sometimes a distinction is made between the two: a costermonger sells from a handcart or animal-drawn cart, while a hawker carries his wares in a basket.\n\nHistory\n\nCostermongers have existed in London since at least the 16th century, when they were mentioned by Shakespeare and Marlowe. They probably were most numerous during the Victorian era, when there were said to be over 30,000 in 1860. They gained a fairly unsavoury reputation for their \"low habits, general improvidence, love of gambling, total want of education, disregard for lawful marriage ceremonies, and their use of a peculiar slang language\" (John Camden Hotten, The Slang Dictionary, 1859). Costers were notoriously competitive: respected \"elder statespeople\" in the costermonger community were elected as pearly kings and queens to keep the peace between rival costermongers. \n\nHowever, crimes such as theft were actually rare among costermongers themselves, especially in an open market where they tended to look out for one another. Even common thieves preferred to prey on shop owners rather than costers, who were inclined to dispense street justice. The costers' animosity towards the police was extreme:\n\nThe activities and lifestyles of 19th century costermongers are comprehensively documented in London Labour and the London Poor, a four volume collection of erudite and well-researched articles by Henry Mayhew. Mayhew describes a Saturday night in the New Cut, a street in Lambeth, south of the river: \n\nSuch was London in the 1840s; but by the end of the 19th century, the costermongers were in gradual decline. They did not disappear as mobile street-sellers until about 1960, when the few that remained took pitches in local markets. They were portrayed in the music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood and Gus Elen. In The Forsyte Saga, Swithin Forsyte is driving Irene Forsyte in his carriage through the streets of London in 1886 and a costermonger (the \"ruffian\") and his girlfriend are riding alongside in their donkey cart, which is overturned in traffic. The anti-hero of Look Back in Anger (1956) by playwright John Osborne is a coster who sells sweets from a stall. The film version depicts aspects of the everyday culture of street markets, such as racial prejudice, irate customers and abusive regulatory officials.\n\nCoster style\n\nBetty May spoke of the \"coster\" style and atmosphere in London around 1900 in her autobiography Tiger Woman: My Story in 1929: \"I am often caught with a sudden longing regret for the streets of Limehouse as I knew them, for the girls with their gaudy shawls and heads of ostrich feathers, like clouds in a wind, and the men in their caps, silk neckerchiefs and bright yellow pointed boots in which they took such pride. I adored the swagger and the showiness of it all.\"May, Betty. (1929) Tiger Woman: My Story. (2014 reprint) London: Duckworth. ISBN 978-0715648551\n\nLegal standing\n\nThe costermonger's trade in London is subject to regulation by law, under the administration of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. If the pitch is stationary, by-laws of local councils also apply. Legislation exists under clause six of the Metropolitan Streets Act 1867, which deals with obstruction by goods to pavements (sidewalks) and streets. There are various modern amendments.\nQuestion:\nWhat does a costermonger sell?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nBilly Cotton\nWilliam Edward \"Billy\" Cotton (6 May 1899 – 25 March 1969) was an English band leader and entertainer, one of the few whose orchestras survived the British dance band era. Cotton is now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s radio and television personality, but his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for Brentford F.C. (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon F.C.), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a Gipsy Moth, which he piloted himself. His autobiography, \"I Did It My Way\", was published in 1970, a year after his death.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Smith Square, London, to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a drummer. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers by falsifying his age and saw service in World War I in Malta and Egypt, before landing at Gallipoli in the middle of an artillery barrage. He was recommended for a commission and learned to fly Bristol Fighter aircraft. He flew solo for the first time in 1918, on the day the Royal Flying Corps became the Royal Air Force. He was not yet 19 years old. In the early 1920s, he worked at several jobs, including as a bus driver, before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.\n\nAt first a conventional dance band, the London Savannah Band gradually tended towards music hall/vaudeville entertainment, introducing visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians who played in Billy Cotton's band during the 1920s and 1930s included Arthur Rosebery, Syd Lipton and Nat Gonella. The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was \"Somebody Stole My Gal\", and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.\n\nDuring the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the Billy Cotton Band Show, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show.  It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of \"Wakey Wakey\". From 1957, it was also broadcast on BBC television. Cotton often also provided vocals on many of his bands recordings and was also a vocalist on recordings that didn't feature his band.\n\nAs a racing driver, his finest moment came in 1949 when he finished fourth in the 1949 British Grand Prix, sharing an ERA with David Hampshire.\n\nCotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921. They had two sons, Ted and Sir Bill Cotton, who later became the BBC's managing director of television. In 1962 Billy Cotton suffered a stroke. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at Wembley.\n\nBilly Cotton was the great-great-uncle of TV & Radio Presenter Fearne Cotton.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n* The First Mrs. Fraser (1932)\n* Variety (1935)\n\nBibliography\n\n* I Did It My Way, Autobiography, 1970, Publisher: George G.

It is part of the region of Attica. The regional unit covers the Saronic Islands, a small part of the Peloponnese peninsula, and a few islands off the eastern Peloponnese coast. \n\nAdministration\n\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Islands was created out of part of the former Piraeus Prefecture. It is subdivided into 8 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\n*Aegina (Aigina, 3)\n*Agistri (Agkistri, 2)\n*Cythera (Kythira, 6)\n*Hydra (Ydra, 13)\n*Poros (9)\n*Salamis (Salamina, 10)\n*Spetses (11)\n*Troizinia-Methana (12)\nQuestion:\nWhich country occupies the islands called Euboea, Kefalonia, Khos, Zakynthos, Thassos, Lefkada, Karpathos and Kythira?\nAnswer:\nYunanistan\nPassage:\nBallasalla\nBallasalla ()  is a village in the parish of Malew in the south-east of the Isle of Man, close to the airport and the town of Castletown. The village was built mostly from the ruins of the nearby Rushen Abbey, a Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century and dissolved in the 16th century.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe lowest-level local authority is Malew Parish Commissioners who are based in Ballasalla.\n There are currently five commissioners. The day-to-day activities of the authority are run by the clerk, Mr Barry Powell.\n The commissioners' offices are located on the main road of the village close to the Whitestone Inn.\n\nResidents' association\n\nThe village has an active residents' association, Ballasalla and District Residents Association (BADRA).\n\nSince 2010 the village has had a very popular Community Partnership set up with the involvement of the Isle of Man Government, outside agencies and local residents, with Graham Cregeen, MHK for Malew and Santon, as Chairman. \n\nEconomy\n\nThe HQ of Citywing, the Isle of Man airline, is at Hangar 9 at Isle of Man Airport near Ballasalla.  The former Manx Airlines also had its head office at the Airport.  At Balthane on the eastern edge of the village is an industrial estate with local businesses including Athol Garage, sellers of motor vehicles, and Pooil Vaaish, dealing in slate, marble and monumental masonry.\n\nEducation\n\nThe village has its own primary school, Ballasalla School. \n\nSport\n\nMalew football club play their home games at the Malew Football Ground, Clagh Vane and Ronaldsway play their home games at the Ronaldsway Aircraft Factory Fields. Both clubs compete in the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 3 buses an hour to Onchan, Douglas, Castletown, Port St Mary and Port Erin operated by the nationalised Bus Vannin. There are also infrequent buses to Peel and Foxdale. Ballasalla railway station on the Isle of Man Railway is at the eastern side of the village and the railway operates between March and November. The station used to have its own cattle dock and goods sidings, seeing intensive use in the early to middle 20th century, although these were lost to office developments in 1985 when the station building was relocated. The A5 Douglas to Port Erin road runs through the village and this is the main route to the south of the island. The Isle of Man Airport is at Ronaldsway just south of the village and also has a small request stop on the railway, a short distance from the terminal. Arriving air passengers sometimes catch trains for the novelty value of travelling by steam train.\n\nReligion\n\nSt Mark's Church is in St Mark's Road, some distance from the village. The foundation stone was laid in 1771 and it was consecrated in 1772 by the then Bishop of Sodor and Man, Mark Hildesley. It was intended to serve as a chapel of ease and a parish school more conveniently located for those from the outlying hill district than Kirk Malew Church. There was an ancient church near the site which is said to have been dedicated to St Mark.  \n\nSt Mary the Virgin, Abbey Church was built from local limestone sourced from Scarlett Point south of Castletown, with the foundation stone being laid in 1895 by Lady Ridgeway, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Sir Joseph West Ridgeway. The church was consecrated in 1896 and remains in regular use today, with its own substantial church hall within its grounds.\n Both churches are Church of England in the Diocese of Sodor and Man.\n\nBallasalla has had three Methodist chapels in the past. The original Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel dates from about 1798. It was restructured in 1846, although the original roof slate is still intact.  It is now a scout hall. Ballasalla (Bridge Road) Primitive Methodist Chapel was built in 1833. It closed as a chapel in 1949, but continued to be used as a Sunday school until 1975. It was sold in 1980 and the seats, pulpit and choir pews were moved to Ballafesson Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A second Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in the village in 1893. It closed in 1980 and was demolished in 1981 as the building was unsafe. \n\nAmenities and events\n\nBallasalla is the site of the mediaeval Monks' Bridge over the Silver Burn which leads to the Manx National Heritage site of Rushen Abbey; this forms part of the Story Of Mann set of attractions established in 1989 and now part of an island-wide series of attractions. The abbey was extensively redeveloped as a heritage site in 1996, having latterly been home to The Academy, one of very few nightclubs outside of Douglas.\n\nAlso near the village is the Silverdale Glen, set amongst woodland, with a small boating lake, café and sprawling playing fields and playground including a water-powered carousel. A wooded footpath alongside the Silverburn river runs between Rushen Abbey, the Monks' Bridge, and Silverdale Glen. In a small hamlet above the village the eponymous St Mark's Fair is held annually on the third Saturday in July.\n The Millennium Way long distance footpath, opened in 1979, which begins at Castle Rushen and heads north towards Ramsey, runs through the village alongside the banks of the river, leading to Poulsom Park in Castletown to the south, and to St. Mark's above the village to the north. \n\nThe village has a pub and various shops. The local authority Malew Parish Commissioners office is next to the pub and a modern office development, Portland Court, occupies former railway goods yard. This was sold off in 1985 for redevelopment and the new station lies on the opposite side of the tracks.\nQuestion:\nBallasalla and Colby are railway stations on which British island?\nAnswer:\nMan Island\nPassage:\nArnolfini\nThe Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol, England. It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions, artist's performance, music and dance events, poetry and book readings, talks, lectures and cinema. There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar. Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources. A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery. Arnolfini is funded by Bristol City Council and Arts Council England, with some corporate and individual supporters.\n\nThe gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees, and was originally located in Clifton. In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square, before moving to its present location, Bush House on Bristol's waterfront, in 1975. The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck's 15th-century painting, The Arnolfini Portrait. Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005. Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Jack Yeats. Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group, the Philip Glass Ensemble, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company. The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010, when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nHistory\n\nJeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel, and the painter John Orsborn in 1961. The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton, Bristol. In 1968, Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square, then to E Shed, the current home of the Watershed Media Centre. In 1975, Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House, occupying two floors of a 19th-century Grade II* listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre. The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group.   \n\nThe architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstital floors. \n\nOriginally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England, under the directorship of Barry Barker (1986–1991) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art. Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield. Before development work began, the Arnolfini was attracting over 285,000 visitors per year. Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson (1991–1999),  Caroline Collier (1999–2005)  and Tom Trevor (2005-2013).\n\nAs part of a two-year development project that finished in September 2005,  \nthe old warehouse has been fully redeveloped, adding another attic storey. Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement, and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs.  One tenant is the School of Creative Arts, part of the University of the West of England. Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker-Mill Trust, set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker-Mill.   The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker-Mill, Ann Hewer, and Lawrence Ogilvie. \n\nName\n\nThe Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini. The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction (an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall) and one of Arnolfini's consistent concerns: to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society. The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.\n\nToday\n\nArnolfini has three floors of galleries, a specialist arts bookshop, a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre, live art, dance and music, a specialist arts bookshop, a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues, and a café bar. Entrance to the galleries is free of charge. Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley, Richard Long, Rachel Whiteread, Paul McCartney, Angus Fairhurst and Louise Bourgeois.  Regular events include poetry and film festivals, live art and dance performances, lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts, including Bodies in Flight, Goat Island Performance Group, Akram Khan, the London Sinfonietta, the Philip Glass Ensemble, Random Dance, and Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company.\n\nThere is an active access and education programme, hosting visits from students, workshops with artists, presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the gallery. project.ARNOLFINI is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events, past and present, which may be reorganised by any online user, utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license. \n \nArnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations, including the Encounters Short Film Festival (along with the Watershed Media Centre),  Mayfest, the first Festival of British Independent Cinema,  the biennial  Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue  and the Bristol Artists Book Events.  In April 2010, British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates.\n\nArnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England,  and Bristol City Council.  According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2009, Arnolfini had 398,000 visitors in 2008/2009. Income was £2.08 million and expenditure was £2.4 million  and the gallery employed 44 people.\nQuestion:\nThe Arnolfini Centre for Contemporary Arts is in which British city?\nAnswer:\nBristol (England)\nPassage:\nHeadlands and bays\nHeadlands and bays are two related features of coastal environments. Headlands and bays are often found on the same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either seawater (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the bay, and typically have sandy beaches. Headlands and bays form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast. \n\nGeology and geography \n\nBays form where weak, or less resistant rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger, or more resistant rocks, such as chalk, limestone, and granite), which form a headland or peninsula. Refraction of waves occurs on headlands concentrating wave energy on them, so many other landforms, such as caves, natural arches, and stacks, form on headlands. Wave energy is directed at right angles to the wave crest, and lines drawn at right angles to the wave crest (orthogonals) represent the direction of energy expenditure. Orthogonals converge on headlands and diverge in bays, which concentrates wave energy on the headlands and dissipates wave energy in the bays.  \n\nIn the formation of sea cliffs, wave erosion undercuts the slopes at the shoreline, which retreat landward. This increases the shear stress in the cliff-forming material and accelerates mass movement. The debris from these landslides collects at the base of the cliff and is also removed by the waves, usually during storms, when wave energy is greatest. This debris provides sediment, which is transported through longshore current for the nearby bay. Joints in the headlands are eroded back to form caves, which erode further to form arches. These gaps eventually collapse and leave tall stacks at the ends of the headlands. Eventually these too are eroded by the waves.  \n\nWave refraction disperses wave energy through the bay, and along with the sheltering effect of the headlands this protects bays from storms. This effect means that the waves reaching the shore in a bay are weaker than the waves reaching the headland, and the bay is thus a safer place for water activities like surfing or swimming. Through the deposition of sediment within the bay and the erosion of the headlands, coastlines eventually straighten out. But then the same process starts all over again.\n\nBeach stability \n\nBeaches are dynamic geologic features that can fluctuate between advancement and retreat of sediment.  The natural agents of fluctuation include waves, tides, currents, and winds. Man-made elements such as the interruption of sediment supply, such as a dam, and withdrawal of fluid can also affect beach stabilization.   A headland bay beach can be classified as being in three different states of sedimentation.  Static equilibrium refers to a beach that is stable and does not experience littoral drift or sediment deposition or erosion.   Waves generally diffract around the headland(s) and near the beach when the beach is in a state of static equilibrium.  Dynamic equilibrium occurs when the beach sediments are deposited and eroded at approximately equal rates.  Beaches that have dynamic equilibrium are usually near a river that supplies sediment and would otherwise erode away without the river supply.  Unstable beaches are usually a result of human interaction, such as a breakwater or dammed river.  Unstable beaches are reshaped by continual erosion or deposition and will continue to erode or deposit until a state of equilibrium is reached in the bay.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\nWhat do you call a piece of land that is surrounded on three sides by water?\nAnswer:\nPenninsula\n", "answers": ["Fruiting", "Friut", "Fruiting Shrubs", "Prutas", "Bacca", "Nutritious fruits", "Simple fruit", "Culture of fruits", "Fruits", "Fleshy fruit", "Seed pod", "Pod types", "Fruit", "Fruity"], "length": 3953, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "a6b0e6b9bf53f05d1569572cebd9359a0d4136a026613c7d"}

This cocktail originated in Venice, Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948    by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini. \n\nThe drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar, a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Orson Welles. Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach purée to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.\n\nThe Bellini is an IBA Official Cocktail. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach purée with an equal amount of mandarin juice, a Rossini, which uses strawberry purée, or a Tintoretto, which is made with pomegranate juice.\n\nPreparation and serving\n\nThe Bellini consists of puréed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition. The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or cherry juice to give the drink a pink glow. Due, in part, to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.\n\nCalifornia produces a white peach that works well,  and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured liqueurs (peach schnapps, for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach purée.\n\nThe Cipriani family produces Bellini Base  for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.\n\nOther sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or seltzer is used in place of the wine.\nQuestion:\nWhich fruit juice is added to champagne to make a Bellini cocktail?\nAnswer:\nPeacherine\nPassage:\nGlobus cruciger\nThe globus cruciger (Latin, \"cross-bearing orb\"), also known as the orb and cross, an orb (Latin globus) topped (Latin gerere, to wear) by a cross (Latin crux), has been a Christian symbol of authority since the Middle Ages, used on coins, in iconography, and with the sceptre as royal regalia. The cross represents Christ's dominion over the orb of the world, literally held in the hand of an earthly ruler (or sometimes it is held by an angel). In the iconography of Western art, when Christ himself holds the globe, he is called Salvator Mundi, the Saviour of the World; his statue is the Infant Jesus of Prague.\n\nHistory\n\nHolding the world in one's hand, or more ominously, under one's foot, has been used as a symbol since antiquity. To citizens of the Roman Empire, the plain round globe held by Jupiter represented the world, or the universe, as the dominion held by the emperor. A 2nd-century coin from the reign of Emperor Hadrian shows the Roman goddess Salus with her foot upon a globus, and a 4th-century coin from the reign of Emperor Constantine I shows her with a globus in hand.  The orbis terrarum was central to the iconography of the Tetrarchy, representing the Tetrarchs' restoration of security to the Roman world. Constantine I claimed to have had a vision of a cross above the sun, with the words \"In this sign, you shall conquer\", at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312. His soldiers painted crosses upon their shields, and then defeated their foe, Maxentius.\n\nWith the growth of Christianity in the 5th century, the orb (in Latin scriptures orbis terrarum, the 'world of the lands', hence the word \"orb\") was topped with a cross (hence globus cruciger), symbolising the Christian God's dominion over the world. The emperor held the world in his hand, to show that he ruled it on God's behalf. To non-Christians already familiar with the pagan globe, the surmounting of a cross sent a message about the triumph of Christianity. In medieval iconography, an object's size, relative to that of nearby objects, indicated its relative importance; so the world was small and the one who held it was  large, to emphasize the nature of their relationship. Although the globe symbolized the entire Earth, its use spread among many Christian rulers (some of them not even sovereign) who reigned over small parts of the earth.\n\nThe first known use was probably in the early 5th century, possibly as early as between 395 and 408 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Arcadius, but most certainly by 423 on the reverse side of the coins of Emperor Theodosius II.\n\nThe globus cruciger was used by powerful rulers and celestial beings alike; it adorned portrayals of both emperors and kings, as well as archangels. It first appeared on coins in the early 5th century and remained popular throughout the Middle Ages in coins, iconography, and royal regalia. The papacy, holding universal canonical jurisdiction and in the Middle Ages once rivaling the Holy Roman Emperor for the supreme feudal status of liege lord of all other (Catholic) rulers, also maintained the symbol on top of the papal tiara (\"triple crown\"; there is no separate papal orb). The crowned orb was in general use as a finial on western royal crowns, whether actual objects or merely heraldic crowns, all over Europe, for example, in Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Imperial Germany, among others.  It may still be seen in the national arms of the surviving European monarchies.  Even in the modern era in England, the Sovereign's Orb symbolises both the state and Church of England under the protection and domain of the royal crown.\n\nGallery\n\nImage:RV Antoniniano Carinus - transparent background.PNG|A Roman Antoninianus coin showing Carinus holding pilum and globe.\nImage:Barbarossa.jpg|Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa.\nImage:Harris-Tweed 1.jpg|The Harris Tweed Orb\nImage:Goldene-bulle 1c-480x475.jpg|The Golden Bull of 1356 by the Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\nImage:Kis Karoly TK.jpg|Charles II of Hungary.\nImage:Mária Thuróczy.jpg|Mary of Hungary.\nImage:Wenzel3.jpg|Wenceslaus III of Bohemia.\nImage:Dürer karl der grosse.jpg|Charlemagne, by Albrecht Dürer.\nImage:Albrecht Dürer 082.jpg|Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, by Albrecht Dürer.\nImage:Gerard van Honthorst 006.jpg|Frederick V holding the orb.\nImage:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|Elizabeth I of England in coronation robes and the orb and scepter\nImage:Wien - Schatzkammer - Orb.png|Austrian globus cruciger, part of the Austrian Crown Jewels\nImage:Russian regalia.jpg|Regalia of Russia.\nImage:Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary2.jpg|Holy Crown, Sword and Globus Cruciger of Hungary.\nImage:IconaDerzhavnaya.jpg|Virgin Mary with an orb on Our Lady Derzhavnaya icon\nFile:Heraldic Globus cruciger.svg|A generic globus cruciger as it may be used in heraldry\nImage:Uppland_vapen.svg|Coat of arms of Uppland\nImage:Coat of arms of Montenegro.svg|Orb and scepter in Montenegrin coat of arms\nQuestion:\nWhich British fabric has an ‘Orb’ trade mark?\nAnswer:\nHarris Tweed\nPassage:\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls - Bio, Facts, Family | Famous Birthdays\nBear Grylls\nGemini Reality Star#10\nAbout\nEnglish adventurer and star of the reality series Man vs. Wild.

It is broadcast on ITV and hosted by Julia Bradbury.\n\nThe show began airing on 22 July 2013 for a 30-episode run  as a summer replacement for The Chase and finished on 30 August 2013.\n\nFormat\n\nThe show consists of three stages, with the aim primarily being to keep as many hourglasses from draining as possible, each timer containing different amounts of cash. In each episode four contestants compete against each other with the aim of answering as many questions correctly as possible.\n\nMain round\n\nAt the start a question is posed to the player on the far left of the studio, The contestant can choose to Stick or Twist, depending on whether they think they know the answer or not. If they decide to Stick, they will answer the question themselves, however if they decide to Twist, they choose which of the other players will answer the question. Whichever option they choose, the three options to the question will then appear. If a player sticks and answers correctly, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, control passes to the next player in the line. If they Twist and the player the question is passed to gets the answer correct, they get to light a Twister, but if incorrect, the player who chose to Twist gets to light a Twister instead. Once the sixth Twister is lit, the player in control gets to 'Take on the Twisters' to bank some money. They face 60 seconds of quick-fire general knowledge questions, with the idea to keep as many of the Twisters in play as possible. Once the time is up, the values of the Twisters remaining in play are revealed and the total amount of money is placed in the contestant's bank. This is repeated 4 times each show.\n\nFinal Twist\n\nThe contestant who has banked the highest amount of cash from the main round goes through to play the \"The Final Twist\" where they can win whatever they have banked in the main game. In this round, all 8 Twisters are in play and the idea is to keep as many of them in play as possible after 60 seconds of quick-fire questions. When the time is up, Julia will offer £200 (£250 in later episodes) for each Twister that remains in play, for example if the player has 5 Twisters in play, £1000 (£1250 under the £250 a Twister rule) will be offered. The contestant's money has been placed behind one of the Twisters by an independent adjudicator. One by one, the Twisters in play are revealed to determine whether the money is there. If it is not there, a red \"X\" will appear on the display, but if the money is there, a gold \"WIN\" will appear.\n\nThe Twisters\n\nThere are eight \"Twisters\" in the show. The colours are red, yellow, blue, orange, green, pink, white and purple, each worth different amounts of cash ranging from £300 to £1,000. The Twisters containing more cash will drain more quickly. If the values of all eight Twisters are revealed, then their amounts are worth double and will remain doubled for the rest of the game.\nQuestion:\nWho presents the ITV quiz show ‘Take on the Twisters’?\nAnswer:\nJULIA BRADBURY\nPassage:\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam ...\nRogue Elephant | Definition of Rogue Elephant by Merriam-Webster\nFirst Known Use of rogue elephant\n1835\nSeen and Heard\nWhat made you want to look up rogue elephant?

There are many scleroprotein superfamilies including keratin, collagen, elastin, and fibroin. The roles of such proteins include protection and support, forming connective tissue, tendons, bone matrices, and muscle fiber.\n\nBiomolecular structure\n\nA scleroprotein forms long protein filaments, which are shaped like rods or wires. Scleroproteins are structural proteins or storage proteins that are typically inert and water-insoluble. A scleroprotein occurs as an aggregate due to hydrophobic side chains that protrude from the molecule.\n\nA scleroprotein's peptide sequence often has limited residues with repeats; these can form unusual secondary structures, such as a collagen helix. The structures often feature cross-links between chains (e.g., cys-cys disulfide bonds between keratin chains).\n\nScleroproteins tend not to denature as easily as globular proteins.\n\nMiroshnikov et al. (1998) are among the researchers who have attempted to synthesize fibrous proteins.\nQuestion:\nIn humans, what is the name of the fibrous protein found in the outer layer of the skin and is a major constituent of hair and nails?\nAnswer:\nKeratin\n", "answers": ["Gordon Jackson (disambiguation)", "GORDON JACKSON", "Gordon Jackson", "Jackson, Gordon"], "length": 2682, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "2a54de979ab1eec474e0411cd269f9600f54b1557608a94f"}

He played the role of Lockhart in these series from 1956 to 1967, and the character was one of the first recurring television detectives.\n\nBorn in London, his first listed television role was as Dr. Watson alongside Alan Wheatley's Holmes in a 1951 BBC TV series entitled Sherlock Holmes, the earliest TV adaptation of the tales. He later reprised the role in a 1984 film The Case of Marcel Duchamp.\n\nHis distinguished appearance often led to roles as senior policemen, military men and English aristocracy; he played such parts in series including Dickens of London, Edward & Mrs. Simpson, The Cedar Tree, Tales of the Unexpected, After Julius, Drummonds, the first Joan Hickson Miss Marple episode \"The Body in the Library\" as Sir Henry Clithering, and his final appearance was in a 1987 Ruth Rendell Mysteries adaptation.\n\nHe was also a noted stage actor and made several appearances in films such as Carrington V.C. and Reach for the Sky.

Blue Swede released two albums of cover versions, including a rendition of  \"Hooked on a Feeling\", which brought them international chart success.  The band consisted of Anders Berglund (piano), Björn Skifs (lead vocals), Bosse Liljedahl (bass), Hinke Ekestubbe (saxophone), Jan Guldbäck (drums), Michael Areklew (guitar) and Tommy Berglund (trumpet).  They disbanded after Skifs decided to embark on his solo career.\n\nCareer\n\nBlue Swede was first formed in 1973, when Björn Skifs, a top vocalist in Sweden, was looking for a band to accompany him during his concerts. \nThe band was originally called \"Blåblus\" (Swedish for \"blue blouse\" or \"blue jeans\", a pun on the word \"blues\" ) and featured Skifs singing the lead vocals. The band got their international breakthrough in 1974 with their cover of the 1968 B. J. Thomas song \"Hooked on a Feeling.\" Blue Swede recorded Thomas' song in 1973, but based its rendition of the song on a 1971 version released by British pop eccentric Jonathan King, which created the \"ooga-chaka ooga-chaka\" introduction. Blue Swede released \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in Sweden in May 1973 and in the United States in February 1974. The song reached number one in the U.S. for one week in April 1974 and stayed in the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 18 weeks. The track also topped charts in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands, where it reached a peak chart position of 26. To capitalize on the success of the song, Blue Swede released an album of the same name that same year.\n\nThroughout the rest of 1974, two follow-up singles from the same album were released: \"Silly Milly\", which peaked at position 71 in the U.S., and a cover of The Association's \"Never My Love\", which made the Top Ten by peaking at position 7. From the band's 1975 follow-up album, Out of the Blue, they recorded a medley of \"Hush\" by Deep Purple and \"I'm Alive\" by Tommy James and the Shondells (not The Hollies' song of the same name), peaking at position 61 in the U.S, and achieving its greatest chart success in Scandinavia.\n\nIn 2014, the band's single \"Hooked on a Feeling\" featured prominently in the film Guardians of the Galaxy. Prior to the film's release, the song's appearance in a trailer resulted in a significant spike in sales.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\n*Hooked on a Feeling (1974)\n*Out of the Blue (1975)\n\nSingles\n\n*\"Hooked on a Feeling\" (1974) U.S. #1\n*\"Silly Milly\" (1974) U.S. #71\n*\"Never My Love\" (1974) U.S. #7\n*\"Hush/I'm Alive\" (1975) U.S. #61\nQuestion:\nWhat was the Blue Swede's only No 1 hit?\nAnswer:\nHooked On A Feeling\nPassage:\nThe Fallen Madonna\nThe Fallen Madonna, usually referred to as The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies,   by the fictional painter van Klomp is a portrait of a bare breasted woman, which provides a running gag in the BBC1 television comedy series 'Allo 'Allo! (1982–92), written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, as well as The Cracked Vase with the Big Daisies by real artist Vincent van Gogh. The first episode of the first series of 'Allo 'Allo! (1984), following the pilot, was titled The Fallen Madonna.  In an earlier pilot the painting was referred to as the reclining Madonna.\n\nRecurring theme\n\nAllo 'Allo! was set in the French town of Nouvion during the German occupation of the Second World War. Its focus was a café in the town square run by René Artois (played by Gorden Kaye). There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the Fallen Madonna, a local treasure, to provide a nest egg after the war. Among those who coveted it were the local German commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm (Richard Marner) and the Führer Adolf Hitler himself on whose behalf Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) of the Gestapo was instructed to secure it (but secretly wanted it for himself).\n\nIn the end of the \" Allo Allo\" series the Fallen Madonna is found by a Senior Rene Artois and his Mistress Yvette Carte Blanche they quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live a very happily ever after.  \n\nThe painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long knackwurst sausage. Forgeries were also in evidence.\n\nAn incredible number of forgeries of the Fallen Madonna were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur LeClerc, which were hidden in knackwurst sausages in René's kitchen. The forgeries were subsequently destroyed in various ways (burned, blown up, minced, eaten by a dog, etc.).\n\nLord Bath\n\nFollowing his assistance with an event connected with the programme, the BBC presented the 6th Marquess of Bath with a specially commissioned copy of the Fallen Madonna that was hung alongside Old Masters in Bath's ancestral home, Longleat.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of the artist who painted the picture of the Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies as featured in TV series Allo Allo?\nAnswer:\nVan klomp\nPassage:\nBellis perennis\nBellis perennis is a common European species of daisy, of the Asteraceae family, often considered the archetypal species of that name.\n\nMany related plants also share the name \"daisy\", so to distinguish this species from other daisies it is sometimes qualified as common daisy, lawn daisy or English daisy. Historically, it has also been commonly known as bruisewort and occasionally woundwort (although the common name woundwort is now more closely associated with Stachys (woundworts)). Bellis perennis is native to western, central and northern Europe, but widely naturalised in most temperate regions including the Americas   and Australasia.\n\nDescription\n\nIt is an herbaceous perennial plant with short creeping rhizomes and rosettes of small rounded or spoon-shaped leaves that are from 3/4 to 2 inches (approx. 2–5 cm) long and grow flat to the ground. The species habitually colonises lawns, and is difficult to eradicate by mowing - hence the term 'lawn daisy'. Wherever it appears it is often considered an invasive weed. \n\nThe flowerheads are composite, in the form of a pseudanthium, consisting of many sessile flowers about 3/4 to 1-1/4 in (approx. 2–3 cm) in diameter, with white ray florets (often tipped red) and yellow disc florets. Each inflorescence is borne on single leafless stems 3/4 - 4 in (approx. 2–10 cm), rarely 6 in (approx. 15 cm) tall. The capitulum, or disc of florets, is surrounded by two rows of green bracts known as \"phyllaries\".\n\nCultivation\n\nB. perennis generally blooms from early to midsummer, although when grown under ideal conditions, they have a very long flowering season and will even produce a few flowers in the middle of mild winters.  \n\nIt can generally be grown in USDA Zones 4 - 8 (i.e. where minimum temperatures are above ) in full sun to partial shade conditions, and requires low or no maintenance. It has no known serious insect or disease problems and can generally be grown in most well-drained soils. The plant may be propagated either by seed after the last frost, or by division after flowering. \n\nThough invasive, the species is still considered a valuable ground cover in certain garden settings (e.g., as part of English or cottage inspired gardens, as well as spring meadows where low growth and some color is desired in parallel with minimal care and maintenance while helping to crowd out noxious weeds once established and naturalised).\n\nNumerous single- and double-flowered varieties are in cultivation, producing flat or spherical blooms in a range of sizes (1 cm to 6 cm) and colours (red, pink & white).  They are generally grown from seed as biennial bedding plants. They can also be purchased as plugs in Spring.  The cultivar 'Tasso series' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nEtymology\n\nBellis is Latin for \"pretty\" and perennis is Latin for \"everlasting\".\n\nThe name \"daisy\" is considered a corruption of \"day's eye\",  because the whole head closes at night and opens in the morning. Chaucer called it \"eye of the day\". In Medieval times, Bellis perennis or the English Daisy was commonly known as \"Mary's Rose\". \n\nThe English Daisy is also considered to be a flower of children and innocence. \n\nDaisy is used as a girl's name and as a nickname for girls named Margaret, after the French name for the oxeye daisy, marguerite.\n\nUses\n\nCulinary\n\nThis daisy may be used as a potherb. Young leaves can be eaten raw in salads   or cooked, noting that the leaves become increasingly astringent with age. Flower buds and petals can be eaten raw in sandwiches, soups and salads. It is also used as a tea and as a vitamin supplement.\n\nHerbal medicine\n\nBellis perennis has astringent properties and has been used in herbal medicine.  In ancient Rome, the surgeons who accompanied Roman legions into battle would order their slaves to pick sacks full of daisies in order to extract their juice, hence the origin of this plant's scientific name in Latin. Bandages were soaked in this juice and would then be used to bind sword and spear cuts.\n\nBellis perennis is still used in homeopathy for wounds and after certain surgical procedures,  as well as for blunt trauma in animals.   Typically, the plant is harvested while in flower when intended for use in homeopathy.\n\nBellis perennis flowers have been used in the traditional Austrian medicine internally as tea (or the leaves as a salad) for treatment of disorders of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract. \n\nOther uses\n\nDaisies have traditionally been used for making daisy chains in children's games. \n\nFile:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Daisies (1894).jpg|Daisies by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1894)\nFile:Maude Goodmann The daisy chain.jpg|The daisy chain by Maude Goodman (1936)\nQuestion:\nBellis perennis is the Latin name of which common flower?\nAnswer:\nDaisy (film)\nPassage:\nLonesome George\nLonesome George (c. 1910 – June 24, 2012) was a male Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii) and the last known individual of the subspecies.     In his last years, he was known as the rarest creature in the world. George serves as a potent symbol for conservation efforts in the Galápagos Islands and throughout the world. \n\nDiscovery\n\nGeorge was first seen on the island of Pinta on 1 November 1971 by Hungarian malacologist József Vágvölgyi. The island's vegetation had been devastated by introduced feral goats, and the indigenous C. n. abingdonii population had been reduced to a single individual. It is thought that he was named after a character played by American actor George Gobel.  Relocated for his safety to the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island, it was hoped that more Pinta tortoises would be found, either on Pinta or in one of the world’s zoos, similar to the discovery of the Española male in San Diego. George was then penned with two females of a different subspecies. Although eggs were produced, none hatched. Unfortunately, no other Pinta tortoises were found. The Pinta tortoise was pronounced functionally extinct as George was in captivity.\n\nMating attempts\n\nOver the decades, all attempts at mating Lonesome George had been unsuccessful, due to the lack of females of his own subspecies. This prompted researchers at the Darwin Station to offer a $10,000 reward for a suitable mate.\n\nUntil January 2011, George was penned with two females of the subspecies Chelonoidis nigra becki (from the Wolf Volcano region of Isabela Island), in the hope his genotype would be retained in any resulting progeny. This subspecies was then thought to be genetically closest to George's; however, any potential offspring would have been intergrades, not purebreds of the Pinta subspecies. \n\nIn July 2008, George mated with one of his female companions. Thirteen eggs were collected and placed in incubators.  On 11 November 2008, the Charles Darwin Foundation reported 80% of the eggs showed weight loss characteristic of being inviable.  By December 2008, the remaining eggs had failed to hatch and x-rays showed they were inviable. \n\nOn 23 July 2009, exactly one year after announcing George had mated, the Galápagos National Park announced one of George's female companions had laid a second clutch of five eggs.  The park authority expressed its hope for the second clutch of eggs, which it said were in perfect condition.  The eggs were moved to an incubator, but on 16 December, it was announced the incubation period had ended and the eggs were inviable (as was a third batch of six eggs laid by the other female). \n\nIn November 1999, scientists reported Lonesome George was \"very closely related to tortoises\" from Española Island (C. n. hoodensis) and San Cristóbal Island (C. n. chathamensis).  On 20 January 2011, two individual C. n. hoodensis female partners were imported to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where George lived. \n\nDeath\n\n \nOn 24 June 2012, at 8:00 am local time, Edwin Naula, Director of the Galápagos National Park, announced that Lonesome George had been found dead by his caretaker of 40 years, Fausto Llerena.     Naula suspects that the cause of death was heart failure consistent with the end of the natural life cycle of a tortoise. A necropsy confirmed that he died of \"old age\".  The body of Lonesome George was frozen and shipped to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City to be preserved by taxidermists.  The preservation work was carried out by the museum's taxidermist George Dante, with input from scientists. \n\nAfter a short display at the museum, it was expected that Lonesome George would be returned to the Galápagos and will be displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see.  However, a dispute has broken out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galapagos Islands over where the preserved body of a Galapagos giant tortoise should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wants him to be shown in the capital Quito but the Galapagos local mayor says Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home. \nMost sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old,  though others such as David Attenborough said he was probably in his eighties or possibly even younger.  Even one hundred is not especially old for a Galápagos tortoise.\n\nBiological conservation\n\nIn November 2012, in the journal Biological Conservation, researchers reported identifying 17 tortoises that are partially descended from the same subspecies as Lonesome George, leading them to speculate that related purebred individuals of that subspecies may still be alive. \n\nIn December 2015 it was reported that the discovery of another species (Chelonoidis donfaustoi) by Yale researchers had a 90% DNA match to that of the Pinta tortoise and that scientists believe this could possibly be used to resurrect the species.\nQuestion:\nWhat sort of creature was Lonesome George who died on Pinta Island in the Galapagos in 2012?\nAnswer:\nTortoise\n", "answers": ["Open back banjo", "Fingerpicking banjo", "Tenor banjo", "Electric banjo", "Banjer", "Five-string banjo", "Stealth Banjo", "Banjos", "Tenor Banjo", "Classic banjo", "Banjo string", "Banjo", "5-string banjo"], "length": 2992, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "4eea3cbcc28d2e2b3588987ce428800a798ba798e2eb6f5d"}
{"input": "Passage:\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nAugustus - Ancient History - HISTORY.com\nGoogle\nAugustus: Birth and Inheritance\nOf Augustus’ many names and honorifics, historians favor three of them, each for a different phase in the emperor’s life. From his birth in 63 B.C. he was Octavius; after his adoption was announced in 44 B.C., Octavian; and beginning in 26 B.C. the Roman Senate conferred on him the name Augustus, the august or exalted one. He was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in Velletri, 20 miles from Rome. His father was a senator and governor in the Roman Republic. His mother Atai was Caesar’s niece, and the young Octavius was raised in part by his grandmother Julia Ceasaris, Caesar’s sister.\nDid You Know?\nIn 8 B.C. Augustus had the Roman month of Sextilius renamed after himself—as his great-uncle and predecessor Julius Caesar had done with July. August was the month of several of the emperor's greatest victories, including the defeat and suicide of Antony and Cleopatra. He did not increase the month's length, which had been 31 days since the establishment of the Julian calendar in 45 B.C.\nOctavius donned the toga, the Roman sign of manhood, at age 16, and began taking on responsibilities through his family connections. In 47 B.C. he went to Hispania (modern-day Spain) to fight alongside Caesar. He was shipwrecked along the way, and had to cross enemy territory to reach his great-uncle—an act that impressed Caesar enough to name Octavius his heir and successor in his will.\nAugustus: The Path to Power\nThe 17-year-old Octavius was at Apollonia (in present-day Albania) when the news of Caesar’s death and his own inheritance arrived. The dead ruler’s allies, including many in the senate, rallied around Octavian against their powerful rival Mark Antony . But after Octavian’s troops defeated Antony’s army in northern Italy, the future emperor refused an all-out pursuit of Antony, preferring an uneasy alliance with his rival.\nIn 43 B.C. Octavian, Antony and Marcus Aemilus Lepidus established the Second Triumvirate, a power-sharing agreement that divided up Rome’s territories among them, with Antony given the East, Lepidus Africa and Octavian the West. In 41 B.C. Antony began a romantic and political alliance with Cleopatra , queen of Egypt, which continued even after a Senatorial decree forced his marriage to Octavian’s sister Octavia Minor. Lepidus remained a minor figure until Octavian finally had him ousted after the triumvirate’s renewal in 37 B.C.\nAntony’s affair with Cleopatra continued, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia. In retaliation, Octavian declared war on Cleopatra. In the naval battle of Actium a year later, Octavian’s fleet, under his admiral Agrippa, cornered and defeated Antony’s ships. Cleopatra’s navy raced to aid her ally, but in the end the two lovers barely escaped. They returned to Egypt and committed suicide, leaving Octavian as Rome’s undisputed ruler.\nAugustus: Emperor in All but Name\nHistorians date the start of Octavian’s monarchy to either 31 B.C. (the victory at Actium) or 27 B.C., when he was granted the name Augustus. In that four-year span, Octavian secured his rule on multiple fronts. Cleopatra’s seized treasure allowed him to pay his soldiers, securing their loyalty. To mollify Rome’s Senate and ruling classes, he passed laws harkening back—at least on the surface—to the traditions of the Roman Republic. And to win over the people, he worked to improve and beautify the city of Rome.\nDuring his 40-years reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire, adding territories in Europe and Asia Minor and securing alliances that gave him effective rule from Britain to India. He spent much of his time outside of Rome, consolidating power in the provinces and instituting a system of censuses and taxation that integrated the empire’s furthest reaches. He expanded the Roman network of roads, founded the Praetorian Guard and the Roman postal service and remade Rome with both grand (a new forum) and practical gestures (police and fire departments).\nAugustus: Family and Succession\nAugustus married three times, although his first union, to Mark Antony’s stepdaughter Clodia Pulchra, was unconsummated. His second wife, Scribonia, bore his only child, Julia the Elder. He divorced in 39 B.C. to marry Livia Drusilla, who had two sons—Tiberius and Drusus—by her first husband, Mark Antony’s ally Tiberius Claudius Nero . The family tree became more complicated after Augustus had his stepson Tiberius briefly marry his daughter, and then adopted Tiberius outright as son and successor in A.D. 4.\nAugustus Caesar died in A.D. 14, his empire secured and at peace. His reported last words were twofold: to his subjects he said, “I found Rome of clay; I leave it to you of marble,” but to the friends who had stayed with him in his rise to power he added, “Have I played the part well? Then applaud me as I exit.” Soon after that acknowledgement of human frailty, the Roman Senate officially declared their departed emperor, like Julius Caesar before him, to be a god.\nTags\nQuestion:\nWho was the first emperor of Rome?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCostard\nCostard is a comic figure in the play Love's Labour's Lost by William Shakespeare.

{"input": "Passage:\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nCharles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" - Legacy\nBy Robert McNamara\nUpdated November 21, 2016.\nCharles Darwin published On the Origin of Species on November 24, 1859 and forever changed the way humans think about science. It's not an exaggeration to say that Darwin's landmark work became one of the most influential books in history.\nDecades earlier, the British naturalist and scholar had spent five years sailing around the world aboard a research ship, H.M.S. Beagle . After returning to England, Darwin spent years in quiet study, examining plant and animal specimens.\nThe ideas he expressed in his classic book in 1859 did not occur to him as sudden bursts of inspiration, but were developed over a period of decades.\nResearch Led Darwin to Write\nAt the end of the Beagle voyage, Darwin arrived back in England on October 2, 1836. After greeting friends and family he distributed to scholarly colleagues a number of specimens he had collected during the expedition around the world. Consultations with an ornithologist confirmed that Darwin had discovered several species of birds, and the young naturalist became fascinated with the idea that some species seemed to have replaced other species.\ncontinue reading below our video\nProfile of Charles Darwin\nAs Darwin began to realize that species change, he wondered how that happened.\nThe summer after returning to England, in July 1837, Darwin began a new notebook and took to writing down his thoughts on transmutation, or the concept of one species transforming into another. For the next two years Darwin essentially argued with himself in his notebook, testing out ideas.\nMalthus Inspired Charles Darwin\nIn October 1838 Darwin re-read Essay on the Principle of Population, an influential text by the British philosopher Thomas Malthus . The idea advanced by Malthus that society contains a struggle for existence struck a chord with Darwin.\nMalthus had been writing about people struggling to survive in the economic competition of the emerging modern world. But it inspired Darwin to begin thinking of species of animals and their own struggles for survival. The idea of \"survival of the fittest\" began to take hold.\nBy the spring of 1840, Darwin had come up with the phrase \"natural selection,\" as he wrote it in the margin of a book on horse breeding he was reading at the time.\nIn the early 1840s, Darwin had essentially worked out his theory of natural selection, which holds that organisms best suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce and thus become dominant.\nDarwin began writing an extended work on the subject, which he likened to a pencil sketch and which is now known to scholars as the Sketch.\nThe Delay in Publishing On the Origin of Species\nIt is conceivable that Darwin could have published his landmark book in the 1840s, yet he did not. Scholars have long speculated on the reasons for the delay, but it seems that it's simply because Darwin kept amassing information he could use to present a lengthy and well-reasoned argument. By the mid-1850s Darwin began working on a major work that would incorporate his research and insights.\nAnother biologist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was working in the same general field, and he and Darwin were aware of each other. In June 1858 Darwin opened a package sent to him by Wallace, and found a copy of a book Wallace had been writing.\nInspired in part by the competition from Wallace, Darwin resolved to push ahead and publish his own book. He realized he could not include all his research, and his original title for his work in progress referred to it as an \"abstract.\"\nDarwin's Landmark Book Published in November 1859\nDarwin finished a manuscript, and his book, titled On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races In the Struggle for Life, was published in London on November 24, 1859. (Over time, the book became known by the shorter title On the Origin of Species.)\nThe original edition of the book was 490 pages, and had taken Darwin about nine months to write. When he first submitted chapters to his publisher John Murray, in April 1859, Murray had reservations about the book. A friend of the publisher wrote to Darwin and suggested he write something quite different, a book on pigeons. Darwin politely brushed that suggestion aside, and Murray went ahead and published the book Darwin intended to write.\nOn the Origin of Species turned out to be quite a profitable book for its publisher. The initial press run was modest, only 1,250 copies, but those sold out in the first two days of sale. The following month a second edition of 3,000 copies also sold out, and the book continued selling through successive editions for decades.\nDarwin's book generated countless controversies, as it contradicted the Biblical account of creation and seemed to be in opposition to religion. Darwin himself remained mostly aloof from the debates and continued his research and writing.\nHe revised On the Origin of Species through six editions, and he also published another book on evolutionary theory, The Descent of Man, in 1871. Darwin also wrote prolifically about cultivating plants.\nWhen Darwin died in 1882, he was given a state funeral in Britain and was buried in Westminster Abbey, near the grave of Isaac Newton. His status as a great scientist had been assured by the publication of On the Origin of Species.\nQuestion:\nIn what decade was Darwin's 'On the Origin of Species' first published?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" — \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\nQuestion:\n\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nTimothy o%60leary\nPassage:\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nFrance - International Codes - The Phone Book from BT\nTo call France, the following dial code is required.\n \n+33 to dial in(00 33 from UK)\nInternational access code\nTo call from France, the following dial code is required.\n \n00 code to dial out(00 44 for UK)\n \nCountry direct\nThe country direct access numbers provide phone access in more than 140 countries, the access numbers for France are:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the international telephone dialling code for France?\nAnswer:\n33\nPassage:\nRed Sky at Morning (1971 film)\nRed Sky at Morning is a 1971 American drama film based on the 1968 Richard Bradford novel of the same name, and starring Richard Thomas, Catherine Burns, and Desi Arnaz, Jr.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film follows Josh Arnold (Thomas), whose family relocates to Corazon Sagrado, New Mexico during World War II. The title of the book/film comes from a line in an ancient mariner's rhyme, \"Red sky at morning, sailor take warning\".\n\nAwards\n\nThe performance by Arnaz earned him the Golden Globe Award as \"New Star of the Year – Actor\" of 1972.\nQuestion:\nRed sky at morning, sailor take what?\nAnswer:\nThe Warning (album)\nPassage:\nFinnegan's Wake\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is a ballad that arose in the 1850s in the music-hall tradition of comical Irish songs. The song was a staple of the Irish folk-music group the Dubliners, who played it on many occasions and included it on several albums, and is especially well known to fans of the Clancy Brothers, who have performed and recorded it with Tommy Makem. The song has more recently been recorded by Irish-American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. The song is also a staple in the repertoire of Irish folk band the High Kings, as well as Darby O'Gill, whose version incorporates and encourages audience participation.\n\nSummary\n\nIn the ballad, the hod-carrier Tim Finnegan, born \"with a love for the liquor\", falls from a ladder, breaks his skull, and is thought to be dead. The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations. Whiskey causes both Finnegan's fall and his resurrection—whiskey is derived from the Irish phrase uisce beatha, meaning \"water of life\". \n\nUncommon or non-standard English phrases and terms\n\n*brogue (accent)\n*hod (a tool to carry bricks in) (Slang term for a tankard or drinking vessel)\n*tippler's way (a tippler is a drunkard)\n*craythur (craythur is poteen (Poitín), \"a drop of the craythur\" is an expression to have some poteen)\n*Whack fol the dah (non-lexical vocalsinging called \"lilting\"; see Scat singing and mouth music it is also punned upon repeatedly by James Joyce as Whack 'fol the Danaan')\n*trotters (feet)\n*full (drunk)\n*mavourneen (my darling)\n*hould your gob (shut-up)\n*belt in the gob (punch in the mouth)\n*Shillelagh law (a brawl)\n*ruction (a fight)\n*bedad (an expression of shock)\n\nNon-English phrases:\n*Thanam 'on dhoul (Irish: Th'anam 'on diabhal, \"your soul to the devil\") However, in other versions of the song, Tim says \"Thunderin' Jaysus.\"\n\nUse in literature \n\nThe song is famous for providing the basis of James Joyce's final work, Finnegans Wake (1939), in which the comic resurrection of Tim Finnegan is employed as a symbol of the universal cycle of life. As whiskey, the \"water of life\", causes both Finnegan's death and resurrection in the ballad, so the word \"wake\" also represents both a passing (into death) and a rising (from sleep). Joyce removed the apostrophe in the title of his novel to suggest an active process in which a multiplicity of \"Finnegans\", that is, all members of humanity, fall and then wake and arise.  \n\n\"Finnegan's Wake\" is featured as the climax of the primary storyline in Philip José Farmer's award-winning novella, Riders of the Purple Wage. \n\nRecordings \n\nMany Irish bands have performed Finnegan's Wake including notably:\n\n*The Clancy Brothers on several of their albums, including Come Fill Your Glass with Us (1959), A Spontaneous Performance Recording (1961), Recorded Live in Ireland (1965), and the 1984 Reunion concert at Lincoln Center. \n*The Dubliners on several live albums. \n*Dropkick Murphys on their albums Do or Die and Live on St. Patrick's Day From Boston, MA. \n*Brobdingnagian Bards on their album Songs of Ireland.\n*The Tossers on their album Communication & Conviction: Last Seven Years.\n*Orthodox Celts on their album The Celts Strike Again.\n*Darby O'Gill on their album Waitin' for a Ride.\n*Ryan's Fancy on their album Newfoundland Drinking Songs.\n*Beatnik Turtle on their album Sham Rock\n*Irish Rovers\n*Christy Moore on his album The Box Set 1964–2004\n*Donut Kings on their single Donut Kings Pub With No Beer\n*Schooner Fare on their album Finnegan's Wake\n*Woods Tea Company on their album The Wood's Tea Co. – Live!\n*Steve Benbow on his album Songs of Ireland\n*Roger McGuinn in his Folk Den series.\n*Dominic Behan on his album Down by the Liffeyside\n*Poxy Boggards on their albums Barley Legal and Bitter and Stout\n*Seamus Kennedy on his album By Popular Demand\n*The High Kings on their albums Memory Lane and Live in Ireland\nQuestion:\n\"What is the occupation of the title character in \"\"Finnegan's Wake\"\" by James Joyce?\"\nAnswer:\nHodcarrier\nPassage:\nScotia Sea\nThe Scotia Sea is a sea located at the northern edge of the Southern Ocean at its boundary with the South Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Drake Passage and on the north, east and south by the Scotia Arc, an undersea ridge and island arc system supporting various islands. The sea sits atop the Scotia Plate.\n\nLocation and description\n\nThe Scotia Sea is the area of water between the Drake Passage, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. These island groups all sit atop the Scotia Arc, which frames the sea on the north, east, and south. The Scotia Sea covers an area of about 900000 km2. About half of the sea stands above the continental shelf.\n\nHistory\n\nNamed in about 1932 after the Scotia, the expedition ship used in these waters by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902–04) under William S. Bruce. The most famous traverse of this frigid sea was made in 1916 by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five others in the adapted lifeboat James Caird when they left Elephant Island and reached South Georgia two weeks later.\n\nIn Argentina, the Scotia Sea is considered part of an area known as the Mar Argentino, and several territories claimed but not occupied by Argentina, such as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, lie within this region.\n\nOn 20 August 2006 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 struck at 1:41 a.m. local time (0341 GMT). The exact location was 61.011°S, 34.375°W at a depth of 10 km with a USGS event ID of \"usrqal.\" \nOn 17 November 2013 at 8:04 a.m. local time (1004 UTC) another earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 struck the unpopulated Islands.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe islands bordering the Scotia Sea are rocky and partly covered in ice and snow year round; despite these harsh conditions, however, the islands do support vegetation and have been described as the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, which includes South Georgia, the volcanic South Sandwich Islands and the South Orkneys in the Scotia Sea, as well as the remote South Shetland Islands near the Antarctic Peninsula and the small isolated volcano called Bouvet Island. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the Antarctic convergence. These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichen and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.\n\nSeabirds include four species of albatross: black-browed albatross (Diomedea melanophris), grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), light-mantled albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), and wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans). There are only five species of bird that remain on land on the islands, and these include two endemic species: a race of the yellow-billed pintail duck (Anas georgica) and South Georgia pipit (Anthus antarcticus). Other birds include the southern giant petrel, with sizeable colonies on Bird Island.\n\nPenguin species found here include large numbers of king penguins on South Georgia especially, as well as chinstrap penguin, macaroni penguin, gentoo penguin, Adelie penguin, and rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome).\n\nSeals include the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) and sub-Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis) in large numbers, leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), the huge southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), and crabeater seal (Lobodon carcinophagus). \n\nThreats and preservation\n\nAlthough the islands have a harsh climate and have never been permanently occupied, they have long been used as a base for fishing and seal-hunting. Wildlife on these remote islands is threatened by introduced species, especially on South Georgia, where even large animals, including reindeer, have been brought to the islands. Further damage to ecosystems results from overfishing.  South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and Bouvet Island are protected as nature reserves, with Bird Island, South Georgia being a site of special scientific interest. The seals are further protected by international agreements, and fur seal populations are recovering.\nQuestion:\nWhat narrows do you sail through to reach Scotia Sea?\nAnswer:\nDrake Strait\n", "answers": ["1850s", "1850–1859", "1850's", "1850-1859", "Eighteen-fifties"], "length": 3058, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "33c79da6f8ac2588e1854e914143b1bca191c90d51db2236"}

DeMille. The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bullrushes as an infant by the pharoah's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses (Charlton Heston) starts out \"in solid\" as Pharoah's adopted son (and a whiz at designing pyramids, dispensing such construction-site advice as \"Blood makes poor mortar\"), but when he discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses (Yul Brynner), Moses returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews, led by the duplicitous Dathan (Edward G. Robinson), are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines. \"Where's your Moses now?\" brays Dathan in the manner of a Lower East Side gangster. He soon finds out. A remake of his 1923 silent film, DeMille's The Ten Commandments may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. It is very likely the most eventful 219 minutes ever recorded to filmand who's to say that Nefertiri (Anne Baxter) didn't make speeches like, \"Oh, Moses, Moses, you splendid, stubborn, adorable fool\"?\nCredits\nAverage Rating: 7.5/10\nTop Critics' Reviews\nFresh: DeMille remains conventional with the motion picture as an art form. The eyes of the onlooker are filled with spectacle. Emotional tug is sometimes lacking. – Variety Staff, Variety, Jul 7, 2010\nFresh: There is no other picture like it. There will be none. If it could be summed up in a word, the word would be sublime. And the man responsible for that, when all is said and done is Cecil B.

Fielding never admitted to writing the work, but it is widely considered to be his.  It is a direct attack on the then-popular novel Pamela (1740) by Fielding's contemporary and rival Samuel Richardson and is composed, like Pamela, in epistolary form.\n\nPublishing history\n\nShamela was originally published anonymously on 4 April 1741 and sold for one shilling and sixpence. A second edition came out on 3 November that same year which was partly reimpressed and partly reset where emendations were made.\n\nA pirated edition was printed in Dublin in 1741 as well. Reprint editions have subsequently appeared as texts for academic study.\n\nPlot summary\n\nShamela is written as a shocking revelation of the true events which took place in the life of Pamela Andrews, the main heroine of Pamela. From Shamela we learn that, instead of being a kind, humble and chaste servant-girl, Pamela (whose true name turns out to be Shamela) is in fact a wicked and lascivious creature and former prostitute, scheming to entrap her master, Squire Booby, into marriage.\n\nThemes and style\n\nThe novel is a sustained parody of, and direct response to, the stylistic failings and moral hypocrisy that Fielding saw in Richardson's Pamela. Reading Shamela amounts to re-reading Pamela through a deforming magnifying glass; Richardson's text is rewritten in a way that reveals its hidden implications, to subvert and desecrate it.  \n\nRichardson's epistolary tale of a resolute servant girl, armed only with her 'virtue' to battle against her master's attempts at seduction, had become an overnight literary sensation in 1741. The implicit moral message – that a girl's chastity has eventual value as a commodity – as well as the awkwardness of the epistolary form in dealing with ongoing events, and the triviality of the detail which the form necessitates, were some of the main targets of Fielding's travesty.\n\nRecent criticism has explored the ways in which Pamela in fact dramatises its own weaknesses. From this perspective, Fielding's work may be seen as a development of possibilities already encoded in Richardson's work, rather than a simple attack.  Another novel by Fielding parodying Pamela, albeit not so explicitly, is The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his Friend, Mr. Abraham Adams (February 1742), more commonly known as Joseph Andrews.\nQuestion:\n‘Shamela’ (1741) was a parody of ‘Pamela’ (1740).

In 1920, the average water level was about 26 meters (85 feet) below sea level. By 1977, the water level had dropped by about 3 meters (10 feet). Then, it rose over the next two decades flooding infrastructure, causing large amounts of economic damage, and forcing tens of thousands of people to move. Then in the mid-1990s, the Caspian Sea began dropping again. The water level now stands at about 27 meters below sea level.\nWith global climate change looming in the coming decades, researchers are attempting to understand all the factors that control the water level on the Caspian. Key factors include: how much rain falls; how much water gets diverted into reservoirs for human use; how much water evaporates before reaching the lake; how do tectonic activity and oil extraction change the height of the land.\nNew research suggests that dust storms may have an effect as well. A study by scientists from the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics and from Istanbul Technical University details how airborne dust affects the region’s climate and water cycle in several ways. For instance, dust particles absorb sunlight, so a cloud of dust can change the distribution of heat in the atmosphere. Specifically, dust clouds warm the atmosphere and cool the water surface below. Such changes reduce the amount of evaporation at the water surface, make the atmosphere less turbulent, and reduce convection (heat rising in the atmosphere). Together, these changes reduce the likelihood of rain.\nThe researchers concluded that dust storms over the Caspian Sea likely reduce lake surface temperatures by 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8  to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while increasing evaporation by about 0.5 millimeters (0.02 inches) per day. This can lead to a drop in lake levels equivalent to 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) per year. In their model, the researchers used observations of dust collected by several satellites sensors, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWIFS).\nOn June 6, 2016, the MODIS instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this image of a thick layer of dust over the southern Caspian Sea.  Notice how the dust has almost completely obscured the water. The dust particles absorb heat from the Sun rather than allowing it to heat the water surface. Dust storms like this are common over the Caspian in spring and summer.\nReferences\nQuestion:\nWhat body of water is 86 feet (26 meters) below sea level?\nAnswer:\nApsheron Threshold\n", "answers": ["Holly Heston Rochell", "John Charles Carter", "Charleton Heston", "Charleston Heston", "Holly Rochell", "Chuck Heston", "Heston, Charlton", "Carlton Heston", "Holly Heston", "Charlton heston", "Charlton Heston"], "length": 1952, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "ae3ca6c00bc0c3a46831d809a0572f9290dd1c59012988a4"}

The territory was named in his honor by French explorer La Salle, who claimed the territory to the west of the Mississippi River in the 1680s for France. The huge land tract—the Louisiana Purchase—would later form all or parts of 15 states and two Canadian provinces. \nBut the cities and towns inside Louisiana have some interesting stories behind their names as well.\nNew Orleans was founded in 1718 as Nouvelle-Orléans by the French explorer Bienville. He named the city in honor of another French official, then Prince Regent of France Philip II, Duke of Orleans.\nLouisiana’s capital city, Baton Rouge , means “red stick” in French. The red stick refers to a blood-stained pole French explorer Iberville found on the bank of the Mississippi River in 1699 at the city’s present location. I’ve heard conflicting stories throughout the years about the stick’s purpose. I’ve heard it was a dividing line between lands occupied and hunted by the Bayougoula and Houma Native American tribes in south Louisiana, but I’ve also heard it was possibly placed to mark the passing of a respected tribal elder. Either way, the stick was placed by the Native Americans.\nOn a related note, several Louisiana cities owe their names to Louisiana’s first residents including Bayou Goula, Houma , Natchitoches , Opelousas , Coushatta , Jena and Ponchatoula .\nShreveport’s name is tied to a 160-mile log jam on the Red River in northwest and central Louisiana in the early 1800s. A steamboat captain and hundreds of men under his command successfully cleared the log jam opening river navigation southward to the Mississippi River. They established a port community north of the jam named for the jam-clearing captain—Henry Miller Shreve.\nLafayette was originally named Vermilionville, for the Cajun community that formed on Bayou Vermilion in the late 1700s. In the early 1800s, locals wanted to rename the small town to recognize the Marquis de Lafayette. The Frenchman aided the U.S. in the Revolutionary War and was subsequently invited on a multi-state tour in his honor as then-President James Monroe celebrated the nation’s 50-year anniversary. It is said many towns visited by Lafayette during the tour were renamed in his honor, but it’s also said Lafayette’s tour didn’t include the present day Louisiana namesake.\nSpeaking of President Monroe, the Louisiana city of Monroe is indirectly named in his honor. The then-young outpost took its name from the James Monroe, a steam-powered paddle wheeler that visited via the Ouachita River in 1819 and showed locals the river could transform the outpost into a bustling town.\nLike other U.S. states, Louisiana has places named for city founders (examples include Alexandria , Berwick and Hammond ) and for nearby natural resources, such as Louisiana’s Lake Charles , Lake Providence and Lake Arthur .\nLouisiana even has one central Louisiana 1800s sawmill town named for a defective natural resource. It’s said that a water wheel was built to power the mill, but the creek on which it sat would stop flowing and become a dry prong every summer. The water wheel was moved to a year-round flowing creek but the town name Dry Prong stuck.\nWhen you’re traveling throughout Louisiana take note of our interesting place names and enjoy the stories behind them.  Learn more about Louisiana's town names in part II and part III .\nQuestion:\n\"What American city has a name that means \"\"Red Stick\"\" in French?\"\nAnswer:\nBaton Rogue, West Florida\nPassage:\nAustralia II\nAustralia II (KA 6) is an Australian 12-metre-class America's Cup challenge racing yacht that was launched in 1982  and won the 1983 America's Cup for the Royal Perth Yacht Club. Skippered by John Bertrand, she was the first successful Cup challenger, ending a 132-year tenure (with 26 successful defences) by the New York Yacht Club.\n\nDesign\n\nAustralia II was designed by Ben Lexcen, built by Steve Ward, owned by Alan Bond and helmed by John Bertrand. Lexcen's Australia II design featured a reduced waterline length and a short chord winged keel which gave the boat a significant advantage in manoeuvrability and heeling moment (lower ballast center of gravity) but it was a significant disadvantage in choppy seas. The boat was also very quick in stays.  The winged keel was a major design advance, and its legality was questioned by the New York Yacht Club. During the summer of 1983, as selection trials took place for the Cup defence that autumn, the New York Yacht Club challenged the legality of the keel design. The controversy was decided in Australia IIs favour.\n\nAustralia II sported a number of other innovative features that contributed to her success, including radical vertical sail designs, all kevlar running rigging and a lightweight carbon fibre boom.\n\nLater claims of Dutch design\n\nIn 2009, Dutch naval architect Peter van Oossanen claimed that the winged keel was actually designed by him and his group of Dutch designers, and not Ben Lexcen.   If true, this would have been reason to disqualify Australia II, since the rules state that the yacht is to be designed by citizens of the nation it represents. The controversy arose due to Cup Rules allowing designers to use model basins for testing that are not located in the challenging country. Model testing was performed in the Netherlands and Peter van Oossanen and another Dutch engineer, Joop Sloof, performed measurements and analyses related to evaluation of winged keel designs. The suggestion that the vessel was not designed by Australians has been refuted by both John Bertrand and project manager John Longley.   Furthermore, it is well established that Lexcen had been experimenting with wing adaptations to the undersurface appendages of boats before, including his 1958 skiffs Taipan and Venom, although in the latter application they were not determined to be effective and not further adopted.   In 1983 Lexcen commented on the controversy: \"I have in mind to admit it all to the New York Yacht Club that I really owe the secret of the design to a Greek guy who helped me out and was invaluable. He's been dead for 2000 years.  Bloody Archimedes...\" \n\nCompetitions\n\nLouis Vuitton Cup\n\nAustralia II dominated the 1983 Louis Vuitton Cup before defeating Azzurra in the semi finals and Victory 83 in the final to win the trophy and earn the right to challenge for the America's Cup.\n\nAmerica's Cup\n\nAustralia II, bearing sail number KA6, represented the Royal Perth Yacht Club of Australia in its September 1983 challenge for the America's Cup. The defender, the New York Yacht Club, had held the cup since 1851, dominating challengers and sustaining the longest winning streak in sport.\n\nAustralia II, skippered by John Bertrand, faced Dennis Conner sailing the 12-metre Liberty in the ocean off Newport, Rhode Island. Australia II came from behind to prevail 4 races to 3. The victory on 26 September 1983  was a landmark event for the nation of Australia, not to mention the Royal Perth Yacht Club.  The achievement was underscored when Australia II was awarded the ABC Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1983.\n\nThe crew of Australia II for the America's Cup races was John Bertrand (skipper), Colin Beashel, Will Baillieu, Peter Costello, Damian Fewster, Ken Judge, Skip Lissiman, John Longley, Brian Richardson, Phil Smidmore, Grant Simmer, and Hugh Treharne. The reserves were Rob Brown, Jim Hardy, Scott McAllister. Beashel was an Olympic medal winning sailor who competed at six Olympic games. Richardson was an Olympic oarsman who had stroked the Australian men's VIII at the Moscow 1980 Olympics.\n\nPopular culture\n\nThe Boxing Kangaroo was the official mascot of the Australia II effort.\n\nThe win was received with much enthusiasm in Australia, with the Men at Work song Down Under becoming the official anthem for the crew.\n\nIn the film Wind, Australia II is portrayed as Boomerang.\n\nRetirement\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Australia II was sold by Alan Bond to the Australian government. She was lent to the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney for display in 1991. In 2000, Australia II was removed from the National Maritime Museum and transferred to the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle. For the 150th anniversary celebrations of the America's Cup in 2001, she was removed from the museum and shipped to the Isle of Wight, sailing with the original crew for several days of commemorative regattas.  Australia II was returned to the Western Australian Maritime Museum, where she is on permanent display.\nQuestion:\nWhat has been won by Australia II and America 3?\nAnswer:\nInternational Cup Race\nPassage:\nAlbertus Pictor\nAlbertus Pictor (English, \"Albert the Painter\"; Immenhusen, c. 1440 – c. 1507), also called Albert Pictor, Albert Målare and Albrekt Pärlstickare (Swedish), is the most famous late medieval Swedish painter, known for his wallpaintings surviving in numerous churches in southern and central Sweden. Celebrations for the quincentenary of his death were arranged for 2009.\n\nCareer\n\nAlbertus was originally called Albertus Immenhusen, after the German town of Immenhausen in Hessen of which he was a native. He occurs in Swedish historical sources from 1465, when he was admitted a burgher of Arboga. Eight years later he moved to Stockholm, where, in accordance with current practice, he took over the workshop as well as the widow of a deceased painter. \n\nHe was a versatile and prolific artist, known to his contemporaries not only for his church wallpaintings, but also as an organist and embroiderer (hence his nickname of Pärlstickare, \"Pearl-embroiderer\"). More than thirty of his schemes, mostly in a secco technique, are extant, many in the Lake Mälaren region, about a third of which bear his signature. Notable examples include wallpaintings at Bromma kyrka, near Stockholm, Lid kyrka, in Södermanland and Täby Kyrkby kyrka in Täby. Part of his life and work are depicted in the illustrated book, \"Albert målare och sommaren i Härkeberga\" (\"Albert the Painter and the summer in Härkeberga\"), which describes his painting of the small church of Härkeberga in Uppland (see below).\n\nInfluence\n\nAlbertus's illustration of Death playing chess from Täby kyrka inspired the famous scene in Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal in which a knight (Antonius Block) plays chess with personified Death. Albertus Pictor himself appears as a character in the film (played by Gunnar Olsson), in a dialog with Jöns, Antonius Block's squire, while working on a church mural.\n\nChurches with wall paintings by or attributed to Albertus Pictor\n\nAlbertus Pictor's paintings are considered preserved in 37 churches. Nine of the painting are either signed with some variant of Albertus name or the signing documented was destroyed. Other paintings ascribed to Albertus Pictor are based on attributes made by experts on the subject. Attenuation on stylistic grounds based on comparisons to those of the churches that have secure signings is difficult to determine especially when it concerns the making of the works. \n\nThe ornamentation has traditionally been important for the attribution, it is, however, in greater part in the public domain and is more general in its expression and easier to copy than figure painting. A lot of them are also strong influenced by over-liming and production with subsequent restoration. Albertus Pictor's painting, however, differ so much from contemporary Swedish painters that they usually can not be attributed to the author. It is conceivable that in some cases they rather have strong influences.\n\n* Almunge (Uppland)\n* Bromma (Stockholm)\n* Bälinge (Uppland)\n* Danmark (Uppland)\n* Dingtuna (Västmanland)\n* Ed (Uppland)\n* Floda (Sörmland)\n* Gryta (Uppsala)\n* Helga Trefaldighet (Uppsala)\n\n* Husby-Sjutolft (Uppland)\n* Håbo-Tibble (Uppland)\n* Härkeberga (Uppland)\n* Härnevi (Uppland)\n* Kalmar (Uppland)\n* Kumla (Västmanland)\n* Lid (Sörmland)\n* Nederluleå(Norrbotten)\n* Odensala (Uppland)\n\n* S Per (Uppsala)\n* Sala (Västmanland)\n* Sollentuna (Uppland)\n* Solna (Uppland)\n* Storkyrkan (Stockholm)\n* Torshälla (Södermanland)\n* Täby (Uppland)\n* Uppsala Cathedral (Uppland)\n* Vadsbro (Södermanland)\n\n* Vaksala (Uppland)\n* Vansö (Sörmland)\n* Vittinge (Uppland)\n* Vårdinge (Södermanland)\n* Vänge (Uppland)\n* Västerås Cathedral (Västmanland)\n* Yttergran (Uppland)\n* Ösmo (Sörmland)\n* Österunda (Uppland)\n* Övergran (Uppland)\nQuestion:\nA 1480s painting by Albertus Pictor in Täby Church located north of Stockholm that inspired a film director depicts a man playing chess with whom?\nAnswer:\nDevitalized\nPassage:\nPeter Parker (British businessman)\nSir Peter Parker KBE LVO (30 August 1924 – 28 April 2002) was a British businessman, best known as chairman of the British Railways Board from 1976 to 1983.\n\nEarly life\n\nParker was born in France on 30 August 1924, but spent part of his childhood in Shanghai, where his father worked for an oil company. The family were evacuated from China in 1937, and while his father went to work in Africa, his mother and the rest of the family settled in Bedford, England, where he attended Bedford School. After leaving school, he won a scholarship to study Japanese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, as one of the \"Dulwich boys\", thirty sixth-formers recruited to boost the ranks of military translators. \n\nIn 1943 he joined the Intelligence Corps of the British Army, serving first in India and Burma, and later in the United States and Japan, eventually reaching the rank of Major. In 1947 he left the army, and after a conversation over tea with Lord Murray of Newhaven studied history at Lincoln College, Oxford.\n\nAt Oxford, he joined the Dramatic Society, where he was widely regarded as the best undergraduate actor of his day alongside contemporaries Kenneth Tynan, John Schlesinger and Lindsay Anderson. Parker met Shirley Catlin (the future Shirley Williams ) in the university's Labour Party club and they had a relationship. In her autobiography (\"Climbing the Bookshelves\") Williams says that \"...by the spring of 1949 I was in love with him, and he, a little, with me...\". He stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate for Bedford in the 1951 general election.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduation he spent two years with Philips before becoming Head of the overseas department of the Industrial Society. He organised a study conference on human problems in industry at the invitation of the Duke of Edinburgh, for which he was appointed a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order in 1957. He then joined Booker McConnell, becoming a Director of the company.\n\nHe remained on the board of Booker until 1970, when he was appointed chairman-designate of the newly nationalised National Ports Authority. This was scrapped following the election of a Conservative government in 1970, leaving Parker to find other directorships until his appointment in 1976 as British Rail's chairman.\n\nChairman of British Rail\n\nSucceeding Sir Richard Marsh, Parker was appointed Chairman of BR in 1976 by the Labour Government and continued to serve during the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher. He guided the organisation through difficult times to the beginnings of the resurgence in train travel in the United Kingdom.\n\nPolitically, he was a socialist (but later joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP)). His socialist principles were severely tested by the industrial relations difficulties with the three railway unions (ASLEF, the National Union of Railwaymen and the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association) while he was Chairman of British Rail. There were several major strikes on the railway system during his chairmanship.\n\nParker reorganised the management of the railway system, creating five business sectors, instead of having it based on geographical regions. He was a critic of the underinvestment in the railways by successive British governments, claiming that he was trying to shore up \"the crumbling edge of quality\". He also campaigned vigorously against the anti-rail lobby, most notably in successfully resisting the recommendations of the Serpell Report in 1982, which had proposed drastic closures.\n\nOn one occasion, Parker had to catch a train from Crewe to Carlisle, but arrived late and accidentally boarded a non-stopper heading for London Euston.  Parker was succeeded in 1983 by the vice-chairman, Robert Reid. \n\nLater career\n\nHis other appointments included the chairmanship of the Rockware Group (1971–76, and 1983–92); Bookers Engineering and Industrial Holdings (1966–70); Associated British Maltsters (1971–73); Curtis Brown (1971–76); Dawnay Day group (1971–76); Mitsubishi Electric UK (1984–96); and Whitehead Mann (1984–2000). He was also chairman of the National Theatre Board, of the British Tourist Authority and of Westfield College. He was knighted in 1978 and appointed KBE in 1993.  He was conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure 1st Class (1991) (Japan). \n\nPersonal life\n\nParker married Gillian Rowe-Dutton in 1951, a General practitioner and expert gardener who wrote \"The Purest of Pleasures:Creation of a Romantic Garden\". The couple had three sons (Alan Parker, public relations; Oliver Parker, film director; Nathaniel Parker, the actor ), and a daughter.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nParker died on 28 April 2002 from a suspected heart attack while on a trip to Turkey.\n\nParker was the first former Chairman of British Rail to have an engine named in his honour. At a ceremony at Old Oak Common, west London, on 17 September 2003, High Speed Train power car number 43127 was named \"Sir Peter Parker 1924–2002 Cotswold Line 150\" by Lady Parker.  The naming had been arranged between the Cotswold Line Promotion Group, which provided the nameplates, and First Great Western, to jointly celebrate the life and work of Sir Peter and the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Cotswold Line between Oxford and Worcester in 1853. Sir Peter was a regular user of Charlbury station on that line.\nQuestion:\nOf which nationalised industry was Peter Parker appointed Chairman in 1976?\nAnswer:\nBritish rail\nPassage:\nPeppa Pig Toys - Peppa & George Toys Games Bedrooms\nPeppa Pig Toys - Peppa & George Toys Games Bedrooms\nPeppa Pig Toys\nThe most wanted Peppa Pig merchandise, over 100 products including toys games clothing and bedroom items.\nPeppa Pig is a young girl who lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George.

Newspapers have reported that Berlusconi told police that a local party official would take custody of the girl, who had visited Berlusconi's Milan villa on at least one occasion.\nEven center-right commentators in Berlusconi's family-owned newspapers have criticized him for intervening in a possible criminal case. Berlusconi's now-estranged ally, Gianfranco Fini, said his antics had embarrassed the country.\nBut Berlusconi again defended his lifestyle and fondness for young women, telling a trade fair in Milan on Tuesday it was \"better to be passionate about a beautiful girl than a gay.\"\nGay rights group Arcigay demanded an apology for causing offense to both women and gays. Later, about two dozen people holding signs with a photo of Berlusconi and denouncing homophobia demonstrated across the street from the premier's office.\nThe premier's comments \"represent a dangerous incitement to prejudice and helps legitimize discrimination, injustice and suffering,\" Arcigay president Paolo Pantane wrote in a letter to Berlusconi's minister for equal opportunity, Mara Carfagna.\nIn response, Carfagna defended Berlusconi's record on anti-discrimination measures and said he had just been joking.\n\"(He) absolutely never intended to offend women or homosexuals,\" she said.\nAnother prominent supporter, Daniela Santanche, a government undersecretary, also rallied to the premier's defense, saying there was nothing disturbing in his comment.\nAfter noting that she \"esteems homosexuals,\" Santanche said: \"I am sure that all Italian parents hope to have heterosexual children.\"\nShe added that \"the hope of every mother is to some day become a grandmother and have their children avoid the problems of a life inherent in the homosexual condition,\" the Italian news agency ANSA quoted her as saying.\nBerlusconi assured supporters on Tuesday that his government still had a majority and would last the remaining half of its five-year term. He said early elections would be a disaster for a country grappling with economic crisis.\nHe contended that the Ruby scandal was whipped up by hostile, deceptive newspapers and again defended his decision to intervene in her case. Ruby was let go by police with no charges after Nicole Minetti, a party official who is also Berlusconi's dental hygienist, took custody of her.\nBerlusconi said Tuesday he'd do the same thing again.\n\"You will see when this is over that there was nothing more than an act of solidarity,\" he said.\nRuby, meanwhile, told Libero, a conservative newspaper close to Berlusconi, that she would tell her version of the story Thursday on a popular state-run TV talk show, but her lawyer later said there were no such plans. Ruby's comments have been inconsistent and prosecutors have reportedly questioned her credibility.\nShe repeated she never had intimate relations with the premier, though she said she \"adored\" him. She clarified that while another young woman linked to Berlusconi, Noemi Letizia, referred to him as \"papi\" (\"daddy\"), she called him \"premier.\"\nBerlusconi's relationship with Letizia, an 18-year-old would-be model from Naples, sparked a scandal last year that prompted Berlusconi's second wife to file for divorce.\nSoon after, a high-end prostitute, Patrizia D'Addario, claimed she had spent a night with the premier and had tape recorded their encounter.\nThe conservative leader has said he has never paid anyone for sex. Prosecutors have said Berlusconi is not under investigation in the scandals over his dalliances with women.\nAdvertisement\nQuestion:\n\"In November 2010, who was widely quoted as saying it's \"\"better to love beautiful girls than gays\"\"?\"\nAnswer:\nBerusconi\nPassage:\nBlock Buster!\n\"Block Buster!\" (also sometimes listed as \"Blockbuster!\") is a 1973 single by Sweet. Written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and produced by Phil Wainman, \"Block Buster!\" was the band's sole UK No. 1 hit. Released in January 1973, it spent five weeks at the top of the UK Singles Chart,  and also made #1 in the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Austria and Ireland, and #3 in Finland, Switzerland, Denmark and Norway. Outside Europe it fared less well as it peaked at #29 in Australia and at #73 on the American Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCharts\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nIts riff was considered markedly similar to fellow RCA act David Bowie's \"The Jean Genie\", released shortly before, but all parties maintain that this was pure coincidence. \n\nTV performances\n\nSome controversy rose after the band's performance of the song on the British television program Top of the Pops at December 25, 1973. In this performance, Sweet's bassist Steve Priest wore a Swastika.\nQuestion:\nWho had a number one hit for six weeks in 1973 with 'Blockbuster'?\nAnswer:\nSweetening\nPassage:\nBraeburn\nThe 'Braeburn' is a cultivar of apple that is firm to the touch with a red/orange vertical streaky appearance on a yellow/green background. Its color intensity varies with different growing conditions.\n\nIt was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by the farmer O. Moran from Waiwhero in the Moutere Hills near Motueka, New Zealand. It was then cultivated by the Williams Brothers nursery as a potential export variety. It is thought to be a cross between Granny Smith and Lady Hamilton.  The apple itself is named after Braeburn Orchard where it was first commercially grown.\n\nBraeburn apples have a combination of sweet and tart flavour. They are available October through April in the northern hemisphere  and are medium to large in size. They are a popular fruit for growers because of their ability to store well when chilled. \n\nBraeburn apples are useful in cooking in that they hold their shape and do not release a great deal of liquid making them ideal for tarts.  According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States. \n\nBraeburn Browning Disorder \n\nApples can be preserved by short, medium or long-term\nstorage. Braeburn can turn brown inside during commercial long term storage, and it’s usually not possible to tell if an apple has the Braeburn browning disorder until a person bites or cuts into it.  Apples respond dramatically to both temperature and atmosphere modification. Rapid temperature reduction and the exacting maintenance of low temperature close to the chilling point of the variety can provide good to medium quality product following 3 to 6 mo of storage and in some cases longer. However, modern commercial warehouses couple\ntemperature management with controlled atmosphere (CA) for long-term storage of apples. Braeburn can be stored at 0 °C in air for 3–4 months, and in CA for 8–10 months, with only a slight susceptibility to scalding although it is sensitive to carbon dioxide.  The variety has a relatively impermeable skin, which restricts diffusion of gases into and out of the fruit, leading to high internal carbon dioxide concentrations. \n\nThe browning disorder seems worse in overmature fruit, fruit from lightly cropped trees, and large fruit, but it can show up on different trees in different years, and in some regions, but not others.\n\nMaintaining the superior qualities of Braeburn while eliminating Braeburn browning disorder led to development of the Jazz cultivar. Since Braeburn is such a desirable variety, commercial orchards and trees in regions and locations that have proven not susceptible to the browning disorder are being maintained. Since most home orchardists do not attempt very long term storage, they do not encounter the browning disorder.\n\nDisease susceptibility \n\n*Scab: high \n*Powdery mildew: high\n*Cedar apple rust: high\n*Fire blight: high\nQuestion:\nBraeburn is a variety of which type of fruit?\nAnswer:\nApple Blossom\nPassage:\nYankee Clipper – World Book INK\nYankee Clipper – World Book INK\nworldbookblog Leave a comment\nJoe DiMaggio, who was born on Nov. 25, 1914, was one of the greatest and most popular players in baseball history. DiMaggio played his entire career, from 1936 to 1951, with the New York Yankees. He was nicknamed “the Yankee Clipper” because of his graceful fielding as an outfielder. He was also called “Joltin’ Joe” because of his powerful hitting.\nDiMaggio had a lifetime batting average of .325 and hit 361 home runs. His record of hitting safely in 56 consecutive games in 1941 is one of the most enduring in baseball history. DiMaggio played in 10 World Series and was voted the American League’s Most Valuable Player in 1939, 1941, and 1947.\nDiMaggio was a superhero in American sports before television was available to spread the popularity of celebrities. Americans eagerly followed his playing career and personal life through newspapers and on radio. DiMaggio’s brief marriage to actress Marilyn Monroe in 1954 caused a national sensation. More than 15 years after DiMaggio retired as a player, Paul Simon’s hit song “Mrs. Robinson” could still nostalgically capture the hold that the baseball great had on the American imagination:\nWhere have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?\nA nation turns its lonely eyes to you,\nWhat’s that you say, Mrs. Robinson,\n“Joltin Joe” has left and gone away.\nJoseph Paul DiMaggio was born in Martinez, California. He died in Hollywood, Florida, on March 8, 1999. Two of his brothers, Dominic and Vincent, also played major league baseball. DiMaggio was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955, the first year he was eligible.\nQuestion:\nWhich US Baseball player was nicknamed The Yankee Clipper?\nAnswer:\nJoe Dimmagio\nPassage:\nVictory in Europe Day\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day was the public holiday celebrated on 8 May 1945 (7 May in Commonwealth realms) to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces.  It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944,  in anticipation of victory.  On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorised by his successor, Reichspräsident Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France and on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. However, the Baltic countries now commemorate VE day on 8 May.  In Ukraine from 2015, 8 May was designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday. \n\nCelebrations \n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations. \n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April.  Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period.   Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\" Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday. \n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square. \n\nSoviet Victory Day \n\nAs the Soviet representative in Reims had no authority to sign the German instrument of surrender, the Soviet leadership proposed to consider Reims surrender as a \"preliminary\" act. The surrender ceremony was repeated in Berlin on 8 May, where the instrument of surrender was signed by supreme German military commander Wilhelm Keitel, by Georgy Zhukov and Allied representatives. Since the Soviet Union was to the east of Germany, it was 9 May Moscow time when the German military surrender became effective, which is why Russia and most of the former Soviet republics commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\nCommemorative public holidays \n\n(May 8 unless otherwise stated)\n* Italy (25 April) \"Festa della Liberazione\" (Liberation Holiday).\n* Denmark (5 May) as \"Befrielsen\" (The Liberation)\n* Netherlands (5 May) as \"Bevrijdingsdag\" (Liberation Day)\n* United Kingdom: In 1995 the May Day bank holiday was moved from the first Monday in May, 1 May, to Monday 8 May, for that year only, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War.\n*East Germany as Tag der Befreiung (Day of Liberation), a public holiday from 1950 to 1966 and in 1985.

The plot is centred on the illegitimate son of a British naval officer singlehandedly bringing about the downfall of a German cruiser during World War I.  The title role is played by John Mills, his first lead role, and it is also notable for being the first film to use actual Royal Navy ships.\n\nThe novel was also later adapted as Sailor of the King (also titled Single-Handed in the US, and sometimes - though rarely - Brown on Resolution), in 1953.  The 1935 version retains the novel's original World War I setting, but in the 1953 remake, the setting is realistically updated to the Second World War, as the Germans resumed commerce raiding with surface warships in 1939.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1893, Betty Brown meets a debonair young naval officer and falls in love. She conceals her pregnancy from him, and he rejoins his ship. The boy, Albert Brown, is brought up by his mother and joins the navy as soon as he is old enough.\n\nBrown's ship is posted to the Pacific during the First World War. He is marooned on the remote Galapagos island of Resolution when the cruiser he is serving on, HMS Rutland, is sunk. A German battlecruiser (the fictitious SMS Ziethen ) takes him prisoner whilst it defeats an inferior British force. It then suffers damage in a second encounter and her captain plans to pull into an isolated Pacific anchorage to try to repair his vessel.  There, the resourceful Brown escapes, steals a rifle and a small amount of ammunition, and makes his way ashore.\n\nThe German vessel's main battery cannot be brought to bear on Brown, and he is able to pick off exposed crew-members who are trying to repair her punctured hull plates.  The anchorage is an impenetrable tangle of scrub and thorn bushes, making it difficult for shore parties to run him to ground.\n\nBrown is eventually killed by a German shot, never learning that his actions delayed the repairs long enough for the raider's British pursuers to catch her up and destroy her. Brown becomes a hero, the British erect a cross on the highest point on the island to commemorate him, and the commander of the British ship discovers that Brown was the illegitimate son he always denied he had.\n\nCast\n\n*Betty Balfour - Elizabeth Brown\n*John Mills - Albert Brown\n*Barry MacKay - Lt.

That is forever England’ is from which poem by Rupert Brooke\nAnswer:\nThe Soldier (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nMarriage of the Virgin\nThe Marriage of the Virgin is the subject in Christian art depicting the marriage of the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph.  The marriage is not mentioned in the canonical Gospels but is covered in several apocryphal sources, and later redactions, notably the 14th century compilation the Golden Legend.  Unlike many other scenes in Life of the Virgin cycles (like the Nativity of Mary and Presentation of Mary), it is not a feast in the church calendar.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox tradition, essentially the same scene, with very similar iconography, is considered to represent the earlier scene of the \"Entrusting of Mary to Joseph\", with Joseph being made Mary's guardian by the temple authorities.  \n\nIn art the subject could be covered in several different scenes, and the betrothal of Mary, with Joseph's blossoming rod, was often shown, despite its apocryphal origin.  Wedding processions are also shown, especially in the Early Medieval period. \n \nThe Betrothal legend in the Golden Legend\n\nThe Golden Legend, which derives its account from the much older Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, recounts how, when Mary was 14 and living in the Temple, the High Priest gathered all male descendents of David of marriageable age including Saint Joseph (though he was much older than the rest). The High Priest ordered them to each bring a rod; he that owned the rod which would bear flowers was divinely ordained to become Mary's husband. After the Holy Spirit descended as a dove and caused Joseph's rod to blossom, he and Mary were wed according to Jewish custom. The account, quoted in its entirety, runs thus:\n\nIn fact, neither the Golden Legend nor any of the early apocryphal accounts describe the actual ceremony, and they differ as to its timing, other than that it preceded the \"Journey to Bethlehem\". It is unclear whether this story was set before or after the Annunciation which, in the New Testament account, occurred after their betrothal but before their marriage. In the Gospel of James it comes after the Annunciation, but in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, the primary source in the West, it comes before it. \n\nArtists\n\nThe scene, or scenes, was a common component in larger cycles of the Life of the Virgin and thus very frequently found, especially in the Middle Ages; it is not found in the typical cycle in a Book of hours however.  The marriage scene has been painted by, among others, Giotto, Perugino, Raphael, Ventura Salimbeni (1613, his last painting), Domenico Ghirlandaio (1485-90, at the Tornabuoni Chapel), Bernardo Daddi (now in the Royal Collection), Pieter van Lint (1640, Antwerp Cathedral), Tiburzio Baldini, Alfonso Rivarola, Francesco Caccianiga, Niccolò Berrettoni, Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio, Filippo Bellini, Veronese (in San Polo church, Venice), Giulio Cesare Milani, Franciabigio (in the Santissima Annunziata, Florence), and Giacomo di Castro.\nQuestion:\nWho painted the 'Marriage Of The Virgin' found in the Pinacoteca di Brera of Milan?\nAnswer:\nRaffaello Sanzio\nPassage:\nSay What You Want\n\"Say What You Want\" is a song by Scottish pop group Texas and the first single to be taken from their fourth studio album White on Blonde.[http://www.discogs.com/Texas-Say-What-You-Want/master/89698 Texas - Say What You Want at Discogs] It was remixed as \"Say What You Want (All Day, Every Day)\" featuring Method Man and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan and re-released as a double A-side with \"Insane\" in 1998. Both versions featured on their 2000 album The Greatest Hits.\n\nIt is the band's biggest hit commercially to date, peaking at #3 on the UK Singles Chart, with the remixed version reaching #4.

It is associated with 1960s style, and fashion figures such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Sir Oswald Mosley's Blackshirt movement had a barracks on the street in the 1930s. \n\nLocation\n\nKing's Road  runs for just under 2 mi through Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, from Sloane Square in the east (on the border with Belgravia and Knightsbridge) and through the Moore Park estate on the border of Chelsea and Fulham opposite Stamford Bridge. Shortly after crossing Stanley bridge the road passes a slight kink at the junction with Waterford Road in Fulham, where it then becomes New King's Road, continuing to Fulham High Street and Putney Bridge; its western end is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nHistory\n\nKing's Road derives its name from its function as a private road used by King Charles II to travel to Kew. It remained a private royal road until 1830, but people with connections were able to use it. Some houses date from the early 18th century. No. 213 has a blue plaque to film director Sir Carol Reed, who lived there from 1948 until his death in 1978. Thomas Arne lived at No. 215 and is believed to have composed \"Rule Britannia\" there. Ellen Terry lived in the same house from 1904–1920, and also Peter Ustinov; the house is commemorated by a blue plaque also. Photographer Christina Broom was born in 1862 at No 8.\n\nIn 1876, the world's first artificial ice rink, the Glaciarium, opened just off King's Road, and later that year it relocated to a building on the street.\n\nDuring the 1960s the street became a symbol of mod culture, evoking \"an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels\", one magazine later wrote.  King's Road was home in the 1960s to the Chelsea Drugstore (originally a chemist with a stylised chrome-and-neon soda fountain upstairs, later a public house, and more recently a McDonalds), and in the 1970s  to Malcolm McLaren's boutique, Let It Rock, which was renamed SEX in 1974, and then Seditionaries in 1977. During the hippie and punk eras, it was a centre for counterculture, but has since been gentrified. It serves as Chelsea's high street and has a reputation for being one of London's most fashionable shopping streets.  Other celebrated boutiques included Granny Takes a Trip, The Sweet Shop in Blantyre Street just off King's Road at World's End and Stop The Shop, a fashion boutique with a revolving floor.\n\n484 King's Road was the headquarters of Swan Song Records, owned by Led Zeppelin.  They left following closure of the company in 1983. King's Road was site of the first UK branch of Starbucks which opened in 1999.\n\n535 King's Road was the headquarters of Cube Records, a late 1960s and early 1970s independent record label. The label folded in the mid 1970s, becoming part of Elektra Records. The building has since been demolished but the new building on the same site still houses a record company.\n\nThe road has been represented in popular culture on various occasions: \"King's Road\" is the title of a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from the 1981 album Hard Promises and is name-checked in the song \"Dick a Dum Dum (King's Road)\" which was a hit for Des O'Connor in 1969. In Ian Fleming's novels, James Bond lives in a fashionable unnamed square just off King's Road.\n\nPlanning and transport\n\n;Planning\nThe eastern part of King's Road is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.\n\n;Bus\nBuses 11, 19, 22, 49, 211, 319, 328, and C3 all go down King's Road, yet most of these turn off the street at one point or another. The 11 and the 22 are the only routes which run the entirety of King's Road, with the 22 being the only route that runs all the way from Sloane Square to the end of New King's Road in Fulham.\n\n;Rail and Tube\nThe western end of King's Road is close to Imperial Wharf railway station on the London Overground network, with connections to Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction. Southern also run direct rail services to  and  from this station. At the eastern end of the street is Sloane Square, and Fulham Broadway lies at the western end, on the boundary between Chelsea and Fulham. King's Road, and the area of Chelsea as a whole, is known for having poor links to the London Underground. Due to this, the route of Crossrail 2 is proposed to have an underground station in this area, called King's Road Chelsea.\n\n;River\nChelsea Harbour Pier is also within easy reach of the western end of King's Road, with river bus services provided by London River Services and Thames Executive Charters to Putney and Blackfriars.

Because of its geographic isolation, Madagascar is home to many amazing animals found nowhere else on Earth. Lemurs may have floated there eons ago on \"rafts\" of vegetation and evolved in isolation over countless centuries.\nRing-tailed lemurs are unmistakable because of their long, vividly striped, black-and-white tail. They are familiar residents of many zoos.\nLemurs use their hands and feet to move nimbly through the trees, but cannot grip with their tails as some of their primate cousins do. Ring-tailed lemurs also spend a lot of time on the ground, which is unusual among lemur species. They forage for fruit, which makes up the greater part of their diet, but also eat leaves, flowers, tree bark, and sap.\nRing-tailed lemurs have powerful scent glands and use their unique odor as a communication tool and even as a kind of weapon. Lemurs mark their territory by scent, serving notice of their presence to all who can smell. During mating season, male lemurs battle for dominance by trying to outstink each other. They cover their long tails with smelly secretions and wave them in the air to determine which animal is more powerful.\nRing-tailed lemurs live in groups known as troops. These groups may include 6 to 30 animals, but average about 17. Both sexes live in troops, but a dominant female presides over all.\nRing-tailed lemurs are endangered, largely because the sparse, dry forests they love are quickly vanishing.\nQuestion:\nLemurs in the wild are unique to which country?\nAnswer:\nIsland of the moon\nPassage:\nGeoffrey Hughes\nGeoffrey Hughes DL (2 February 1944 – 27 July 2012) was an English actor.\n\nHughes rose to fame for portraying much-loved binman Eddie Yeats in the popular long-running British soap opera Coronation Street from 1974 to 1983, making a return to the show in 1987. He went on to appear in two popular British television sitcoms during the 1990s, playing loveable slob Onslow in Roy Clarke's Keeping Up Appearances (1990–1995) followed by Twiggy in Craig Cash and Caroline Aherne's The Royle Family (1998–2000), the latter of which he reprised his role for the specials in 2006 and 2008. \n\nFrom 2001 to 2005 he played Vernon Scripps, conman and loveable rogue, on the ITV police drama Heartbeat (2001–05), taking over as the show's main loveable rogue from Bill Maynard, and returning to the show briefly in 2007 after the character was thought dead.\n\nIn 1996 Hughes was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and in 2010 he suffered a cancer relapse which led him to retire from acting. He died from the illness, aged 68, in 2012.\n\nCareer\n\nHughes attended Ranworth Square Primary School, Liverpool until the age of 11. He then went to Abbotsford Secondary Modern School in Norris Green, Liverpool. He started his career in repertory at the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent. This was followed by his first West End production, the Lionel Bart and Alun Owen musical Maggie May. His other West End productions included the stage version of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Say Goodnight to Grandma, The Secret Life of Cartoons and several seasons of Run for your Wife. He recently played \"Pistol\" in an open air production of Henry V at Barnwell Manor. He also toured extensively in Britain and abroad. He had relatives in Shetland.\n\nAmong his many other appearances on television are: An Arrow for Little Audrey; The Saint; Shadows of Fear; Z-Cars; Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased); Flying Lady; Making Out; Coasting; Doctor Who; Spender; and Boon. He played 'Trinculo' in an all filmed version of The Tempest for the BBC and 'Squire Clodpoll' in Good Friday 1663, one of Channel Four's new avant-garde operas. His comedy appearances on TV include The Likely Lads, Please Sir!, Dad's Army, Curry and Chips, No, Honestly, The Upper Hand and the character of Onslow in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances.\n\nHughes' film credits included Smashing Time (1967), The Bofors Gun (1968), Till Death Us Do Part (1969), The Virgin Soldiers (1969), The Man Who Had Power Over Women (1970), Revenge (1971), Carry on at Your Convenience (1971), Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973), Tiffany Jones (1973), Confessions of a Driving Instructor (1976), Nijinsky (1980), and Flick (2008). He was also the voice of Paul McCartney in the Beatles' 1968 cartoon film Yellow Submarine.\n\nIn 1974 Hughes was cast as binman Eddie Yeats in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street. Over the next nine years he became, with Stan Ogden (as played by Bernard Youens), a foil to Stan's long-suffering wife Hilda (Jean Alexander). Many fans still regard these performances as a high point in the soap's history. He left the series in 1983, making a brief final return appearance in 1987 as part of Hilda's departure from the series. In recent years he was offered the opportunity to return to the show, but declined.\n\nHughes usually appeared in pantomime over the Christmas period. He appeared on That Antony Cotton Show on 6 September 2007, in which he spoke about his role in a short film called Expresso, which also starred Sir Norman Wisdom. Hughes played the part of a man who visits a coffee shop for a \"normal\" coffee but is served by a pompous waiter. The film was sold in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support.\n\nIn 2007 he performed the Angel Gabriel in the BBC production Liverpool Nativity.

Born in Wallasey, on the Wirral in Cheshire, to parents Ada and Bill, he had one younger brother Gordon and was brought up in Liverpool. He is survived by his wife, whom he first met in the Navigation Inn at Buxworth in the High Peak of Derbyshire, then owned and run by Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner in Coronation Street).\n\nHughes was also the Honorary Squire of the Dartington Morris Men and made an appearance at the Dartington Morris Ring meeting in September 2008. His musical interests included English folk-rock and he compered at Fairport's Cropredy Convention annual music festival several times.   \n\nDeath\n\nHughes received a diagnosis of prostate cancer in 1996 while he was playing Onslow in Keeping Up Appearances.  He died from the illness on 27 July 2012.  He thought he had beaten the cancer, but in 2010, while attending a charity event, he suffered from extreme back pains, so painful he couldn't even stand up. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer again. Doctors said that he died \"peacefully in his sleep\".\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first name of the character played by Geoffrey Hughes in the TV sitcom Keeping Up Appearances'?\nAnswer:\nOnslow\nPassage:\nJohn Ridgway (sailor)\nJohn Ridgway, MBE, (born 1938), is a British yachtsman and rower.\n\nBiography\n\nRidgway was educated at the Pangbourne Nautical College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

He has become infamous because of the disappearance of his young nephews - the Princes in the Tower - and through William Shakespeare's play 'Richard III'.\nIn 2012, archaeologists and researchers began excavating beneath a carpark in Leicester, hoping to find Richard's final resting place. The search captured the public's imagination and the remains subsequently found were confirmed as those of Richard.\nPhoto: Portrait of Richard III by an unknown artist. (National Portrait Gallery)\nIntroduction\nThe Battle of Bosworth Field\nMelvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.\nMelvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, the celebrated climactic encounter of the Wars of the Roses.\nMore information about: King Richard III\nRichard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. His father was Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York and his mother Cecily Neville. Richard had a claim to the English throne through both parents. We now know that Richard had a curvature of the spine, but the withered arm and limp of legend are almost certainly either fabrications or greatly exaggerated.\nWars of the Roses\nHis father's conflict with Henry VI was a major cause of the Wars of the Roses, which dominated Richard's early life. His father and older brother died at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460. In 1461, Richard's brother, Edward, became Edward IV and created him Duke of Gloucester. In 1470, Edward and Richard were exiled when Henry VI was briefly restored to the throne. The following year, they returned to England and Richard contributed to the Yorkist victories at Barnet and Tewkesbury which restored Edward to the throne.\nThe Princes in the Tower and seizure of the throne\nWhen Edward died in April 1483, Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. As the new king travelled to London from Ludlow, Richard met him and escorted him to the capital, where he was lodged in the Tower of London. Edward V's brother later joined him there.\nA publicity campaign was mounted condemning Edward IV's marriage to the boys' mother, Elizabeth Woodville, as invalid and their children illegitimate. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed these claims. The following day, Richard III officially began his reign. He was crowned in July. The two young princes disappeared in August and were widely rumoured to have been murdered by Richard.\nThe beginning of the end\nA rebellion raised in October by the Duke of Buckingham, Richard's former ally, quickly collapsed. However, Buckingham's defection, along with his supporters, eroded Richard's power and support among the aristocracy and gentry.\nDeath of a warrior king\nIn August 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who was a Lancastrian claimant to the throne living in France, landed in South Wales. He marched east and engaged Richard in battle on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire on 22 August. Although Richard possessed superior numbers, several of his key lieutenants defected. Refusing to flee, Richard was killed in battle and Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII.\nQuestion:\nFor how many years was Richard III king of England?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThomas Minton\nThomas Minton (1765 – 1836) was an English potter. He founded Thomas Minton & Sons in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which grew into a major ceramic manufacturing company with an international reputation.\n\nDuring the early 1780s Thomas Minton was an apprentice engraver at the Caughley Pottery Works in Shropshire, under the proprietorship of Thomas Turner, working on copperplate engravings for the production of transferware.  The engraver Thomas Lucas went from there to work for Josiah Spode at Stoke-on-Trent in 1783, taking some elements of the fashionable chinoiserie patterns with him.  While at Caughley Thomas Minton is thought to have worked on chinoiserie landscape patterns including willows, and to have prepared copperplates of them:  but the Salopian works never produced the standard willow pattern which includes the bridge and the fence in the foreground.  \n\nMinton left the Salopian works in 1785, and married Sarah in London in 1789. In 1793 he established his own pottery factory in Stoke-upon-Trent principally for the manufacture of white-glazed earthen tablewares or pearlware including blue transfer printed and painted wares. Variations of his willow and other designs were acquired by Spode and other factories, and it was in this context that the English willow pattern was created. He was favoured and employed by Josiah Spode, for whom he engraved a new version of the pattern. To Minton is also attributed the popular 'Buffalo' pattern engraved for Spode.  He was assisted by Henry Doncaster of Penkhull: his pupil William Greatbatch (father of William Greatbatch (1802-1885), another notable engraver) became chief engraver for Spode and for the successor company, Copeland's.  \n\nIn c. 1796 Minton went into partnership with Joseph Poulson, who produced ornamental bone china at a factory nearby, and from c.1798 Minton employed Poulson's factory for his own china wares. After Poulson's death in 1808 he continued china production there until 1816. In 1824 he built a new factory for china, on the basis of which the company of 'Thomas Minton and Sons', known more simply as 'Mintons', was developed. At his death in 1836 his son Herbert Minton (1793-1858) continued and redeveloped the business.\n\nHis portrait was made by James Northcote, R.A..\n\nSources\nQuestion:\nThomas Minton at Stoke on Trent created what in 1789?\nAnswer:\nThe Willow Pattern\nPassage:\nnavel - English-French Dictionary WordReference.com\nnavel - English-French Dictionary WordReference.com\nEnglish\nnavel nnoun: Refers to person, place, thing, quality, etc.\n(anatomy: belly button) (courant)\nnombril nmnom masculin: s'utilise avec les articles \"le\", \"l'\" (devant une voyelle ou un h muet), \"un\".

A large weapon, the arbalest had a steel prod (\"bow\"). Since an arbalest was much larger than earlier crossbows, and because of the greater tensile strength of steel, it had a greater force. The strongest windlass-pulled arbalests could have up to 22 kN (5000 lbf) of force and be accurate up to 100 m. A skilled arbalestier (arbalester) could loose two bolts per minute.\n\nNomenclature \n\nThe term \"arbalest\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"crossbow\". \n\"Arbalest\" is a Medieval French word originating from the Roman name ' (from ' ‘bow’ + ' ‘missile-throwing engine’),  which was then used for crossbows, although originally used for types of artillery. \nModern French uses the word ', which is linguistically one step further from the stem (disappearance of the s phoneme in the last syllable, before t). \n\nThe word applies to both crossbow and arbalest (the latter may be referred to as a heavy crossbow, but an actual heavy crossbow may not be the same as an arbalest). In some cases, the word has been used to refer to arbalists, the people who actually used the weapon.\nQuestion:\nThe arbalest was a variety of which weapon?\nAnswer:\nStonebows\nPassage:\nEnd of the road for the zebra? | UK news | The Guardian\nEnd of the road for the zebra? | UK news | The Guardian\nEnd of the road for the zebra?\nSixty years after its introduction, the black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing is being replaced due to safety fears\nExperts say that zebra crossings can actually cause accidents. Photograph: Alamy\nShare on Messenger\nClose\nIn the 60 years since it was officially introduced to Britain's roads, the zebra has evolved into the panda , the pelican and the puffin . Now the original black-and-white striped pedestrian crossing, a pair of Belisha beacons its only adornment, is nearing extinction.\nMore than 1,000 zebras have gone in the past five years, and many thousands more have been replaced by higher-tech pelicans (red, amber and green lights for drivers; red and green men for pedestrians) and puffins (like pelicans, but with added sensors).\n\"Essentially, drivers don't take as much notice of zebra crossings as they should because there's no red light telling them to stop, and pedestrians don't feel as safe as they do with a signal telling them when to cross,\" says Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety.\nHoward expects plain zebras to vanish from all but the slowest-moving city-centre roads within the next few years. \"To a large extent,\" he says, \"they already have. I'm struggling to think of a single plain zebra in Basingstoke.\"\nRoad safety experts have long argued that because zebras – launched in Britain in 1951 after trials first of a blue-and-yellow, then a red-and-white version – give priority to pedestrians but do not actively slow vehicles down, they may elicit unsafe behaviour from both.\nResearch by the New Zealand Transport Agency in 2007 suggested that a zebra without any traffic slowing measures could actually increase pedestrian accidents by 28%. Combined with a speed bump, however, it reduced them by 80%. Here, five people died on zebra crossings last year and 144 were injured.\nOne example of this iconic part of the UK road network will, however, survive: the crossing on the cover of the Beatles' 1969 Abbey Road LP is now Grade II listed .\nQuestion:\nWhat road safety item was introduced into the UK on 31 October 1951\nAnswer:\nZebra Crossings\nPassage:\nHernando's Hideaway\n\"Hernando's Hideaway\" is a tango show tune, largely in long metre, from the musical The Pajama Game, written by Jerry Ross and Richard Adler and published in 1954. It was sung in the stage and film versions of the musical by Carol Haney.\n\nThe most successful recording of the song was done by Archie Bleyer, the record reaching No. 2 on the Billboard  chart in 1954. A rendition by Enoch Light was featured prominently on Command Records' Provocative Percussion as well as the Command test record. It has also been covered by David Clayton Thomas, and is often played by breakbeat DJs. The R&B singer Debelah Morgan sampled it (with different lyrics and a new middle section) on her international pop hit \"Dance With Me\" released in 2000. The instrumental section of The Johnston Brothers' 1955 recording (a No. 1 UK hit that year)   was used as the theme for Brick Top Polford in the movie Snatch.\n\nA live recording (from Carnegie Hall in 1954) by Ella Fitzgerald  can be found on the Verve/Polygram release Jazz at the Philharmonic, the Ella Fitzgerald Set, with Ray Brown on bass and Buddy Rich on drums.\n\nThe Pajama Game is set in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Hernando's Hideaway was a raunchy dive in East Dubuque, Illinois, perched on a high cliff overlooking the highway between Dubuque and Galena. The movie was based on the stage play of the same name which, in turn, was based on the book; it is only in the original book that there is information about where the story takes place. A number of places around the world today are named Hernando's Hideaway, evidently based on the popularity of the song.\n\nThere are at least 15 Finnish versions by different artists of the song, the first and most popular by Olavi Virta, in 1956.\n\n\"Hernando's Hideaway\" also became a nickname for the smoking room for British parliamentarians in the House of Commons. The Labour Member of Parliament, Stephen Pound, told the House during a smoking debate on February 14, 2006: \"I refer the House to the dystopic hell – 'Hernando's Hideaway' – that is the Smoking Room on the Library Corridor. It is like the Raft of the Medusa most nights, with great groups of people crammed into it.\" \n\nIn 2014, the song was featured on the popular FOX show So You Think You Can Dance during its 11th season.

Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, whereupon the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.\n\nThe Legend\n\nIcarus' father Daedalus, a very talented and remarkable Athenian craftsman, built the Labyrinth for King Minos of Crete near his palace at Knossos to imprison the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster born of his wife and the Cretan bull. Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos's daughter, Ariadne, a clew  (or ball of string) in order to help Theseus, the enemy of Minos, to survive the Labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.\n\nDaedalus fashioned two pairs of wings out of wax and feathers for himself and his son. Daedalus tried his wings first, but before trying to escape the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun, nor too close to the sea, but to follow his path of flight. Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him, Icarus soared into the sky, but in the process he came too close to the sun, which due to the heat melted the wax. Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms, and so Icarus fell into the sea in the area which today bears his name, the Icarian Sea near Icaria, an island southwest of Samos.    \n\nHellenistic writers give euhemerising variants in which the escape from Crete was actually by boat, provided by Pasiphaë, for which Daedalus invented the first sails, to outstrip Minos' pursuing galleys, and that Icarus fell overboard en route to Sicily and drowned. Heracles erected a tomb for him.  \n\nClassical literature\n\nIcarus' flight  was often alluded to by Greek poets in passing, but the story was told briefly in Pseudo-Apollodorus.  In the literature of ancient Rome, the myth was of interest to Augustan writers. Hyginus narrates it in Fabula 40, beginning with the bovine love affair of Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun, resulting in the birth of the Minotaur. Ovid narrates the story of Icarus at some length in the Metamorphoses (viii.183–235), and refers to it elsewhere. \n\nMedieval and Renaissance literature\n\nOvid's treatment of the Icarus myth and its connection with that of Phaëthon influenced the mythological tradition in English literature  as received and interpreted by major writers such as Chaucer,  Marlowe,  Shakespeare,  Milton,  and Joyce. \n\nIn Renaissance iconography, the significance of Icarus depends on context: in the Orion Fountain at Messina, he is one of many figures associated with water; but he is also shown on the Bankruptcy Court of the Amsterdam Town Hall - where he symbolizes high-flying ambition. \nThe 16th-century painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, traditionally but perhaps erroneously attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, was the inspiration for two of the 20th century's most notable ecphrastic English-language poems, \"Musée des Beaux Arts\" by W.H. Auden and \"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus\" by William Carlos Williams.  Other English language poems referencing the Icarus myth are \"To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Triumph\" by Anne Sexton, \"Icarus Again\" by Alan Devenish, \"Mrs Icarus\" by Carol Ann Duffy, and \"Icarus Burning\" and \"Icarus Redux\" by Hiromi Yoshida.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLiterary interpretation has found in the myth the structure and consequence of personal over-ambition.   An Icarus-related study of the Daedalus myth was published by the French hellenist Françoise Frontisi-Ducroux.    In psychology there have been synthetic studies of the Icarus complex with respect to the alleged relationship between fascination for fire, enuresis, high ambition, and ascensionism.   In the  psychiatric mind  features of disease were perceived in the shape of the pendulous emotional ecstatic-high and depressive-low of  bipolar disorder. Henry Murray having proposed  the term Icarus complex, apparently  found symptoms particularly in mania where a person is fond of heights, fascinated by both fire and water, narcissistic and observed with fantastical or far-fetched imaginary cognition.\nQuestion:\nWhat legendary figure flew too close to the sun?\nAnswer:\nIcharus\n", "answers": ["2", "Two", "two"], "length": 3056, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c392f62eb05235efcd5d07680c3cd7acc53f50726004165d"}

It is named after James Parkinson, who, in 1817, wrote a classic essay on “shaking palsy” a disease whose cause is still unknown.\n1. There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.\n2. The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease increases with age, with the peak onset in the 70s and is more common in men by a ratio of 3:2\n3. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease do not occur until 80% of neurons in the substantia nigra are lost. The substantia nigra is located in the midbrain and controls voluntary movement, produces dopamine, and regulates moods.  The dopamine cells begin to die therefore messages from the brain to the body are decreased and leave the person unable to control movements normally.\n4. The classic manifestations of Parkinson’s disease often include tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are often called the triad.\nA. Tremor, often the first sign may be minimal initially therefore the patient is the only one who notices it. The tremor can affect handwriting and is described as “pill rolling” because the thumb and forefinger appear to move in a rotary fashion as if rolling a pill.\nB. Rigidity, the second sign, is the increased resistance to passive motion when the limbs are moved through their range of motion. The rigidity is caused by sustained muscle contraction and elicits a complaint of muscle soreness; feeling tired and achy; pain in the head, upper body, spine, or legs.\nC. Bradykinesia, the final sign of the triad is particularly evident in the loss of automatic movements. They include blinking of the eyelids, swinging of the arms while walking, swallowing of saliva, self expression with facial and hand movements, and minor movement of postural adjustment.\n5.   Genetic factors associated with Parkinson’s disease include 13 genes; environmental factors include exposures\nto chemicals such as carbon monoxide and manganese; and the use of illicit drugs such as amphetamine and methamphetamine can also cause Parkinson’s disease.\n6.  Exercise can limit decreased mobility, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and constipation. The American Parkinson Disease Association publishes booklets and videotapes that provide helpful exercises. A physical therapist or occupational therapist may be consulted to design a personal exercise program for the patient. Exercise will not halt the progress but will enhance the patient’s functional ability.\n7. Diet is a major importance to patients with Parkinson’s disease because malnutrition and constipation can be serious consequences of inadequate nutrition. Patients should eat foods that are easily chewed and swallowed and should allow\nthemselves ample time for eating to avoid frustration and encourage independence. Patients are advised to limit their protein intake if they are on levodopa.\n8. Parkinson’s can be treated with drug therapy that aims at correcting an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Each patient must be evaluated to determine which medication is best for them. Some drug classes\ninclude; Dopamine Agonists, Anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors and Carbidopa/Levodopa. Levodopa is the most effective and is being used in 70 to 80 percent of all Parkinson’s patients.\n9.  Parkinson’s disease can be treated surgically through deep brain stimulation (DBS). This involves placing an electrode in the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus and connecting it to a generator placed in the upper chest. The device delivers a specific current to the brain to improve motor function. This procedure is reversible if needed.\n10. Parkinson’s disease interesting opinions: Adolf Hitler is said to have had the disease, people who smoke and drink are less likely to develop the disease, and Japan is the only country in the world that has more women than men with Parkinson’s disease.\nReferences\nPDF founder William Black.

The Reversing Falls of St. John are located on a gorge that leads into the Bay of Fundy. At low tide, the water from the gorge comes cascading down on its way to the bay. At high tide, however, which in this part of the world is excessive, the bay's water level rises 5 feet higher than that of the river itself. That causes a \"bore,\" or rushing tide, to flow back into the river, and thus it pushes the water back up the falls.\nThe salt in seawater comes primarily from the fresh water that flows into the sea. As streams and rivers flow across the land, they absorb a great deal of salt from rocks and the earth, and they carry this salt out to sea. There the fresh water evaporates and leaves the salt deposits behind.\nAnne Boleyn, one of two unfortunate wives of Henry VIII sent to die in the Tower of London, had six toes on one foot, six fingers on one hand and three breasts.

Dominated by the Rocky Mountains, Idaho's Shoshone Falls on the Snake River,   drops 212 feet making it higher than Niagara             Falls . Hells Canyon , also on the Snake River,   is a gorge that is deeper than the Grand Canyon.  More             about Shoshone Falls .\nIdaho can be divided into three major land regions geographically;   the Rocky Mountains, the Columbia Plateau and the Basin and Ridge Region.\nRocky Mountains: The Rocky Mountains area is the state's largest area and extends from the Idaho Panhandle (That's   the narrow strip of Idaho that runs between Washington and Montana and borders Canada.) south and along the Wyoming border.  The Rocky   Mountains area is characterized by steep gorges, deep canyons and swift streams and rivers. Idaho has 50   mountain peaks that climb into the sky over 10,000 feet. Borah Peak , Idaho's   highest point rises 12,662 feet above sea level.\nThe Bitterroot Mountain Range lies along the Montana border in the Idaho Panhandle.  The Continental Divide   passes through Idaho in the Bitterroots. Visit the Bitterroot National Forest .\nThe Coeur d'Alene Mountains in the northern Panhandle lie to the west of the Bitterroot Mountain Range.   This triangular area of mountains stretches from Lake Pend Orielle in the north to Coeur d'Alene Lake in the   south. The highest peak in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains is Grizzly Mountain at 5, 950 feet.\nSouth of the Coeur d'Alene Mountains are the Clearwater Mountains and south   of the Clearwater Mountains are the Salmon River Mountains. The Bighorn Crags , bare   granite worn into sharp ridges and spires, are found in the Salmon River Mountains.  This mountain range is   almost completely circled by the Salmon River.\nSouth of the Salmon River Mountains are the impressive Sawtooth Mountains ;   an extremely rugged series of granite peaks and beautiful meadows and alpine lakes. 33 mountains in this range   exceed 10,000 feet above sea level.\nThe Seven Devils Mountains rise along Idaho's border with Oregon in the west. To the west of the Seven Devils Mountains , lies the Snake   River and Hells Canyon .  From the summits of the Seven Devils Mountains to the bed of the Snake River, the deepest   gorge in North America is over 7,800 feet, deeper than the Grand Canyon.\nIn central Idaho, the Lost River Range extends 70 miles, northwest to southeast, from the Salmon River   almost to Arco. It's bordered on the west by the Big Lost River Valley and the Salmon River and on the east   by the Little Lost River and Pahsimeroi Valleys.  The Lost River Range is a vast wilderness of snow-capped peaks   and home to Borah Peak , Idaho's   highest mountain as well as six other 12,000 foot peaks.\nThe Lemhi Range runs in a southeasterly direction about 100 miles from the Salmon River to the Snake River Plains.  This chain   of mountains is from 10 to 15 miles wide. The Lemhi Range is bordered on the west by Pahsimeroi and Little   Lost River valleys and on the east by the Lemhi and Birch Creek Valleys. The highest point in the Lemhi   Range is Diamond Peak at 12,197 above sea level.\nFurther south, the Blackfoot Mountains form a group of barren ridges that trend from northwest to   southeast for more than 50 miles between Idaho Falls and Soda Springs. From the west, slopes of the   Blackfoot Mountains climb roughly 2,400 feet above the Snake River. On the east, the slopes rise   only 600 feet above Willow Creek and the Blackfoot River. Blackfoot Peak is the highest point in this   range at 7, 404 feet. Wolverine Canyon, a scenic gorge, is on the western slope of the Blackfoot Mountains.\nQuestion:\nTo ten thousand square miles, what is the area of Idaho?\nAnswer:\n82751 area\nPassage:\nGoose\nGeese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese). A number of other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have \"goose\" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller.\n\nEtymology \n\nThe word \"goose\" is a direct descendent of Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root gave Old English gōs with the plural gēs and gandres (becoming Modern English goose, geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), Frisian goes, gies and guoske, New High German Gans, Gänse, and Ganter, and Old Norse gās. This term also gave Lithuanian žąsìs, Irish gé (goose, from Old Irish géiss), Latin anser, Greek χήν/khēn, Dutch gans, Albanian gatë (heron), Sanskrit hamsa and hamsi, Finnish hanhi, Avestan zāō, Polish gęś, Ukrainian гуска and гусак, Russian гусыня and гусь, Czech husa, and Persian ghāz. \n\nThe term goose applies to the female in particular, while gander applies to the male in particular. Young birds before fledging are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump. \n\nTrue geese \n\nThe three living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey geese, including the greylag goose, and domestic geese; Chen, white geese (often included in Anser); and Branta, black geese, such as the Canada goose.\n\nTwo genera of \"geese\" are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape Barren goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these or, more probably, the goose-like Coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese.\n\nFossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10 million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named Anser atavus (meaning \"progenitor goose\") from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans. In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nGeese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year; however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more, two factors that result in more young.\n\nOther birds called \"geese\" \n\nA number of mainly Southern Hemisphere birds are called \"geese\", most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. These are:\n* Orinoco goose, Neochen jubata\n* Egyptian goose, Alopochen aegyptiacus\n* The South American sheldgeese, genus Chloephaga\n* The prehistoric Madagascar sheldgoose, Centrornis majori\n\nThe spur-winged goose, Plectropterus gambensis, is most closely related to the shelducks, but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily, the Plectropterinae.\n\nThe blue-winged goose, Cyanochen cyanopterus, and the Cape Barren goose, Cereopsis novaehollandiae, have disputed affinities. They belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the Tadorninae, Anserinae, or closer to the dabbling ducks (Anatinae).\n\nThe three species of small waterfowl in the genus Nettapus are named \"pygmy geese\". They seem to represent another ancient lineage, with possible affinities to the Cape Barren goose or the spur-winged goose.\n\nA genus of prehistorically extinct seaducks, Chendytes, is sometimes called \"diving-geese\" due to their large size.\n\nThe unusual magpie goose is in a family of its own, the Anseranatidae.\n\nThe northern gannet, a seabird, is also known as the \"Solan goose\", although it is a bird unrelated to the true geese, or any other Anseriformes for that matter.\n\nIn popular culture \n \n\nThere are a number of well-known sayings regarding geese.\n\n\"What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\" means what's appropriate treatment for one person is equally appropriate for someone else.\n\nSaying that someone's \"goose is cooked\" means that they have suffered, or are about to suffer, a terrible setback or misfortune.\" \n\n\"Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" derived from an old fable, is a saying referring to any greed-motivated, unprofitable action that destroys or otherwise renders a favorable situation useless.\n\n\"A wild goose chase\" that one goes on or sends someone else on is a useless, futile waste of time and effort.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the collective name for a flock of geese in flight, especially in V-formation?\nAnswer:\nSkein\nPassage:\nKeebler Company\nThe Keebler Company is the largest cookie and cracker manufacturer in the United States. Founded in 1853, it has produced numerous baked snacks. Keebler has marketed its brands such as Cheez-It (which have the Sunshine Biscuits brand), Chips Deluxe, Club Crackers, E.L. Fudge Cookies, Famous Amos, Fudge Shoppe Cookies, Murray cookies, Austin, Plantation, Vienna Fingers, Town House Crackers, Wheatables, Sandie's Shortbread, Chachos and Zesta Crackers, among others.\nThe Keebler slogans are \"Uncommonly Good\" and \"a little elfin magic goes a long way\". Tom Shutter and Leo Burnett wrote the familiar jingle.\n\nCompany history \n\nGodfrey Keebler, of German descent, opened a bakery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1853. In 1927, this bakery and others formed the United Biscuit Company, which at one point was headquartered in West Drayton, Middlesex, England.\n\nKeebler-Weyl Bakery became the official baker of Girl Scout Cookies in 1936, the first commercial company to bake the cookies (the scouts and their mothers had done it previously). By 1978, four companies were producing the cookies.  Little Brownie Bakers is the Keebler division still licensed to produce the cookies.\n\nKeebler was acquired by United Biscuits in 1974.  In 1995, United Biscuits sold Keebler to a partnership between Flowers Industries and Artal Luxembourg, a private equity firm.  Artal Luxembourg sold its holdings in Keebler in an IPO in 1998. \n\nIn March 2001, The Keebler Company was acquired by the Kellogg Company. At that time, headquarters were based in Elmhurst, Illinois.  Currently, Keebler has manufacturing plants in United States, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\nKeebler Elves \n\nThe animated Keebler Elves, led by \"Ernest J. Keebler\", or \"Ernie\", rank among the best-known characters from commercials. The elves have appeared in countless television advertisements throughout the years, shown baking their unique products. In the commercials, The Keebler tree logo is often turned into the tree in which the elves reside.\n\nLeo Burnett Worldwide, an advertising agency, created the elves in 1968, calling the bakery \"The Hollow Tree Factory.\"\n\nJ.J. Keebler was the \"\" original head elf in 1969 and was featured in a classroom film about how animated commercials are made, \"Show and Sell\", with J.J.'s voice done by Alan Reed Sr. Ernie Keebler became \"head elf\" in 1970.  White-haired Ernie wears a green jacket, a white shirt with a yellow tie, a red vest, and floppy shoes.\n\nErnie Keebler was first voiced by Walker Edmiston, and then later by Parley Baer. and then Andre Stojka.\n\nOther elves were Fryer Tuck (who promoted \"Munch-ems\"), Zoot and J.J. (known for Pizzarias), Ernie's mother Ma Keebler, young Elmer Keebler, Buckets (who threw fudge on the cookies), Fast Eddie (who wrapped the products), Sam (the peanut butter baker), Roger (the jeweler), Doc (the doctor and cookie maker), Zack (the fudge shoppe supervisor), Flo (the accountant), Leonardo (the artist), Elwood (who ran through the dough), Professor, Edison, Larry and Art.\nMany of the Keebler commercials were narrated by the announcer Danny Dark. The first Keebler elves were drawn by children's author/illustrator and commercial artist Roger Bradfield.\n\nList of Keebler Snacks\n\nExamples of Keebler products include: \n* 100 Calorie Right Bites,\n* Vienna Fingers Reduced Fat cookies,\n* Chips Deluxe Chocolate Lovers cookies,\n* Chips Deluxe Rainbow cookies,\n* Animals Frosted cookies,\n* Grahams Cinnamon,\n* Ice Cream Cups,\n* Grahams Original,\n* Club® variety, including Original, Reduced,\n* Fat crackers, Multigrain, minis,\n* Keebler Fudge Shoppe Cookies\n* Pizzerias\n* Simply Made cookies \n* Munch'Ems \n\nIn popular culture \n\n* In the Angel season 5 episode \"Power Play,\" Spike says to Drogan, a hero who lives in a fortress that is entered through a hole in a tree, \"Oh, so you tacked up a sign on your tree, waved bye to the Keeblers, hopped the puddle and somehow managed to sniff me out in a city of ten million?\"\nQuestion:\nWho has been the “head” elf in the Keebler Cookie Tree since 1970?\nAnswer:\nErnie (disambiguation)\n", "answers": ["Notable sufferers of parkinson's disease", "Symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Signs of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons", "Pakinson's Disease", "Parkinson's", "Parkinsonism, primary", "Parkinston's disease", "Shaking Palsy", "Hypokinetic rigid syndrome", "Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson's disease and Diet", "Morbus Parkinson", "Motor symptoms parkinson's disease", "Parkinsonians", "Antiparkinsonism", "Shaking palsy", "Parkinson’s", "Neuropsychiatric symptoms of parkinson's disease", "Epidemiology of parkinson's disease", "History of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s Disease", "Parkinsons' disease", "Diagnosis of parkinson's disease", "Prognosis of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson disease", "Parkinsons Disease", "Traumatic Parkinson's", "Parkinson's disease research directions", "Parkinson's Disease", "Causes of parkinson's disease", "Research directions in parkinson's disease", "Parkinston’s disease", "Parkinson's disease", "Parkinson’s disease", "Pathophysiology of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons' Disease", "Classification of parkinson's disease", "Parkinsons disease", "Parkinsonian tremor", "Research directions of parkinson's disease", "Paralysis agitans", "Parkinsonian tremors", "Genetic causes of parkinson's disease", "Parkinson facies"], "length": 3756, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "c4b386c53685937af74499b525d67f81ae166c5503849214"}

It is first sung in the musical by the character Alex Dillingham, which was originated by Michael Ball in both the London and Broadway casts.  The song was released as a single in 1989, also sung by Ball,  and stayed in the UK singles chart for 14 weeks, peaking at #2 and becoming Ball's signature tune.  The song was later featured on Ball's 1992 self titled debut album and Love Changes Everything: The Collection.   \n\nIn the prologue to Aspects of Love, a young Englishman, Alex, is lovestruck by a French actress, Rose. This upends his world, and he sings that \"Love changes everything ... How you live and / How you die\" for better or for worse.  He notes that love \"Makes fools of everyone\" and concludes that, once love strikes, \"Nothing in the / World will ever / Be the same.\"  Musically, it is a \"simple, effective three-chord piano-accompanied anthem\".  The song became the best-known number from Aspects of Love and it \"delivered yet more proof that Andrew Lloyd Webber could deliver soaring, anthemic ballads\".  \n\nThe song was featured at the 44th Tony Awards.  Artists who have covered it include Jonathan Antoine, John Barrowman, Sarah Brightman, Michael Crawford, Il Divo (with Michael Ball), Audra McDonald, Nana Mouskouri, Marti Webb, Opportunity Knocks winner Mark Rattray, Anthony Warlow, and Hayley Westenra.

The total area is 21 square kilometers (8.1 sq mi). The December 2 to 6 census puts the population at 9,275. The 2009 estimate is 14,019. The density is 476.2/km2. The island can be found at the South Pacific.\nGeneral Information\nNauru is the tiniest independent republic on the planet. It also holds the distinction of being the only republic that doesn’t have a capital. Based on archaeological findings, the island was first inhabited by Polynesians and Micronesians over 3,000 years ago. A dozen tribes were on the island. This can be seen by the 12 points on its flag.\nEarly History\nThe smallest island nation in the world had its first European visitor in 1798. It was a whaler named Captain John Fearn. Other Europeans would get wind of it. European criminals and deserters would often escape to the island.\nThe local inhabitants began trading food for firearms. This practice would lead to a tribal war. The Nauruan Tribal War lasted for ten years. It devastated the island and reduced the population by 1/3.\nThe 1800s and World War I\nThe war ended in 1888 when the nation fell under German rule. The war ended when the Germans forbade firearms and alcohol. The island nation became part of the German Marshall Islands Protectorate. Christian missionaries began arriving that year as well.\nThe Germans lost Nauru to the UK during World War I. The island nation would become part of the UK, Australia and New Zealand. These countries took control of the phosphate mining in Nauru.\nWorld War II and Independence\nThe country fell to the Japanese in World War II. Over a thousand native inhabitants were sent to the Chuuk Islands for slave work. It was liberated by the Allies in 1945.\nThe UN designated administrative rights to the UK, New Zealand and Australia. Nauru was granted independence in 1966. Operation and ownership of the phosphate deposits were given to the country.\nPopulation\nIndigenous peoples make up most of the country’s population. 58% are native to the island while 26% are Pacific Islanders. Europeans and some Chinese constitute the remaining eight percent. The dominant religion is Christianity.\nThe smallest island nation also has numerous minority religions. The most prominent is Baha'i. The per capita income is $2,500 (2006 estimates). It still doesn’t have a capital, but Yaren is the seat of government. It is also the most populated area.\nFollow Us!\nQuestion:\nAt 21 square kilometers, which is the world's smallest island nation?\nAnswer:\nList of islands of Nauru\nPassage:\nQuality control\nQuality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. ISO 9000 defines quality control as \"A part of quality management focused on fulfilling quality requirements\". \n\nThis approach places an emphasis on three aspects:\n# Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes,   performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records\n# Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications\n# Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.\n\nControls include product inspection, where every product is examined visually, and often using a stereo microscope for fine detail before the product is sold into the external market. Inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface blemishes for example.\n\nThe quality of the outputs is at risk if any of these three aspects is deficient in any way.\n\nQuality control emphasizes testing of products to uncover defects and reporting to management who make the decision to allow or deny product release, whereas quality assurance attempts to improve and stabilize production (and associated processes) to avoid, or at least minimize, issues which led to the defect(s) in the first place. For contract work, particularly work awarded by government agencies, quality control issues are among the top reasons for not renewing a contract. \n\nNotable approaches to quality control\n\nThere is a tendency for individual consultants and organizations to name their own unique approaches to quality control—a few of these have ended up in widespread use:\n\nQuality control in project management\n\nIn project management, quality control requires the project manager and/or the project team to inspect the accomplished work to ensure its alignment with the project scope.  In practice, projects typically have a dedicated quality control team which focuses on this area.\nQuestion:\nWhat does T.Q.C. mean in manufacturing industry ?\nAnswer:\nQuality Standards\nPassage:\nJerry Kasenetz\nJerry Kasenetz (born May 5, 1943, Brooklyn, New York) is an American bubblegum pop producer who worked with Jeff Katz, the two working together as the Super K Productions company,  to manufacture and produce bands such as Shadows of Knight, Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus, The Music Explosion, 1910 Fruitgum Company, Crazy Elephant, and The Ohio Express.\nQuestion:\nThe name of what genre has its origin in what producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz had in their mouths when they discussed music targeting the younger crowd?\nAnswer:\nBubblegum Pop/Bubblegum Rock\nPassage:\nKielder Water\nKielder Water   is a large artificial reservoir in Northumberland in North East England.  It is the largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom by capacity and it is surrounded by Kielder Forest, the largest man-made woodland in Europe. The scheme was planned in the late 1960s to satisfy an expected rise in demand for water to support a booming UK industrial economy. But the decline of traditional heavy industry, together with more water-efficient industrial processes and better control of water supply leakage, served to undermine the original justification for the reservoir and many came to criticise the government-funded project as a white elephant. \n\nKielder Water is owned by Northumbrian Water, and holds 200 billion litres (44 billion gallons, or 0.2 cubic km), making it the largest reservoir in the UK by capacity (Rutland Water is the largest by surface area).  It has a  shoreline, and is 39.7 km (24.6 miles) from the sea. \n\nConstruction\n\nAfter the scheme was approved by Parliament in 1974, work to build the reservoir and the dam in the Kielder Valley began in 1975. The reservoir and dam was designed for Northumbrian Water by consulting engineers Babtie, Shaw and Morton.     with Sir Frederick Gibberd and Partners as consulting architect.  Earth moving and infrastructure construction was undertaken in a joint venture with AMEC and Balfour Beatty. \n\nThe design meant the loss of numerous farms and a school. The former permanent way of the Border Counties Railway was also taken away through the development of the reservoir.\n\nWork was completed in 1981. Elizabeth II officially opened the project the following year. The valley took a further two years to fill with water completely.\n\nHydro electric plant\n\nKielder Water is also the site of England's largest hydro electric plant. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 May 1982 and is owned by Northumbrian Water. In December 2005, RWE Npower Renewables bought the rights to operate the plant and sell the electricity generated by it, with a contract lasting until 2025. Following the takeover, the turbines were refurbished in 2005–2006, which increased the efficiency of the electricity generation. Controls were also updated, meaning that the plant can be operated from Dolgarrog in Wales.\n\nThe plant generates electricity using dual turbines which produce 6 megawatts (MW) of electricity. This comes from a combination of a 5.5 MW Kaplan turbine, which generates electricity when water release takes place, and a 500 kilowatt (kW) Francis turbine that generates constantly from the compensation flow of water from the reservoir into the North Tyne. This gives the reservoir an average production of 20,000 MWh of electricity per year, a saving of 8,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year compared to fossil fuel based methods of generation.\n\nOperations\n\nThe reservoir's main use is to provide compensating discharges into the North Tyne to support abstractions of water further downstream. It also underpins the £167m Kielder Transfer Scheme, where water can be transferred to the Wear and the Tees rivers, to meet shortfalls in those areas. In recent years, Kielder Water has become increasingly important, with underground springs ensuring that it always remains at high levels, regardless of the prevailing climate condition. This means that while the south of England is often forced to implement drought strategies and hosepipe bans, north east England enjoys plentiful water supplies.\n\nThere are two main visitor centres at Kielder Water—Leaplish waterside park and Tower Knowe visitor centre—and other facilities at Kielder, Falstone and Stannersburn villages. It is also one of the region's major tourist venues, attracting more than 250,000 visitors a year who come to enjoy the wide range of leisure opportunities on offer.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n=\nQuestion:\nKielder Water is the largest artificial lake in the UK.

It was directed by Anthony Asquith and starred Michael Redgrave.\n\nPlot\n\nAndrew Crocker-Harris is an aging Classics master at an English public school, and is forced into retirement by his increasing ill health. The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final few days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realization that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school.\n\nThe emotional turning-point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, Robert Browning's translation of the Agamemnon, which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master.\"\n\nDifferences between play and film\n\nRattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends on Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with warm applause and cheers by the boys. The film ends with a conversation between Crocker-Harris and Taplow, and the suggestion that Crocker-Harris will complete his translation of the Agamemnon.\n\nCast\n\n* Michael Redgrave as the embittered Andrew Crocker-Harris\n* Jean Kent as his wife Millie\n* Nigel Patrick as her lover Frank Hunter, Andrew's fellow schoolmaster who eventually rejects Millie for her cruelty towards her husband\n* Ronald Howard as Gilbert, Crocker-Harris's successor\n* Wilfrid Hyde-White as the Headmaster\n* Brian Smith as Taplow\n* Bill Travers as Fletcher\n* Judith Furse as Mrs. Williamson\n* Peter Jones as Carstairs\n* Sarah Lawson as Betty Carstairs\n* Scott Harold as Rev.

The school exteriors were filmed on location at the Sherborne School in Sherborne, Dorset.\n\nThe Greek text that appears on the blackboard in Crocker-Harris's classroom is from [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?docPerseus:text:1999.01.0003:line\n403 the Agamemnon].

Films  rated X are intended only for viewing by adults, usually legally defined as people over the age of 18 or 21.\n\nAustralia\n\nThe Australian Classification Board (ACB), a government institution, issues ratings for all movies and television shows exhibited, televised, sold or hired in Australia. Material showing explicit, non-simulated consensual sex that is pornographic in nature is rated X18+.\n\nPeople under 18 may not buy, rent, exhibit or view these films. The exhibition or sale of these films to people under the age of 18 years is a criminal offence carrying a maximum fine of $5,500.\nFilms classified as X18+ are banned from being sold or rented in most Australian states. They are legally available to be sold or hired in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. \nImporting X18+ material from these territories to any of the Australian states is legal, as the constitution forbids any restrictions on trade between the states and territories. \n\nThe X18+ rating does not exist for video games.\n\nFrance\n\nFilms may be shown in theaters in France only after classification by an administrative commission of the ministry of Culture. In 1975, the X classification (officially: \"pornographic or violence-inciting movies\") was created for pornographic movies, or movies with successions of scenes of graphic violence. The commission has some leeway in classification, it may for instance take into account the artistic qualities of a movie not to count it pornographic.\nMovies with an X rating may only be shown in specific theaters (which hardly exist nowadays in France); they bear special taxes and tax rates, including a 33% tax on revenue.\nIn 2000, some conservative associations sued the government for granting the movie Baise-moi, which contained graphic, realistic scenes of sex and violence, a non-X classification. The Conseil d'État at litigation ruled that the movie should have been rated X. The decision was highly controversial, and some suggested changing the law under which it was rated 18.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe original X certificate, replacing the H certificate, was issued between 1951 and 1982 by the British Board of Film Censors in the United Kingdom. It was introduced as a result of the Wheare Report on film censorship. From 1951 to 1970, it meant \"Suitable for those aged 16 and over,\" and from 1970 to 1982 it was redefined as meaning \"Suitable for those aged 18 and over\". The X certificate was replaced in November 1982 by the 18 certificate.\n\nSometimes the rating of a film has changed significantly over time. For example, the French film  Jules and Jim received an X rating in 1962 that was changed to a PG rating in 1991.  In some early cases, films politically motivated received an X rating. The Battleship Potemkin was rejected for \"inflammatory subtitles and Bolshevik propaganda\" in 1926, rated X in 1954, and finally rated PG in 1987. \n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, the X rating was applied to a film that contained content judged unsuitable for children, such as extreme violence, strongly implied sex, and graphic language. When the MPAA film rating system began in the US on November 1, 1968, the X rating was given to a film by the MPAA if submitted to it or, due to its non-trademarked status, it could be self-applied to a film by a distributor that knew beforehand that its film contained content unsuitable for minors. From the late 1960s to about the mid-1980s, many mainstream films were released with an X rating such as Midnight Cowboy, Last of the Mobile Hot Shots, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, A Clockwork Orange, Fritz the Cat, Last Tango in Paris and The Evil Dead. (Films that achieved critical and commercial success were later re-rated R after minor cuts, including Midnight Cowboy and A Clockwork Orange.) The threat of an X rating also encouraged filmmakers to re-edit their films to achieve an R rating. Certain films, such as Cruising (1980), received an R rating that some theatre owners felt should have been an X (Cruising was withdrawn from distribution after it was clear that required cuts to obtain the R rating had not been made). \n\nBecause the X rating was not trademarked, anybody could apply it to their films, including pornographers, as many began to do in the 1970s. As pornography began to become chic and more legally tolerated, pornographers placed an X rating on their films to emphasize the adult content. Some even started using multiple X's (i.e. XX, XXX, etc.) to give the impression that their film contained more graphic sexual content than the simple X rating. In some cases, the X ratings were applied by reviewers or film scholars, e.g. William Rotsler, who wrote \"The XXX-rating means hard-core, the XX-rating is for simulation, and an X-rating is for comparatively cool films.\"  Nothing beyond the simple X rating has ever been officially recognized by the MPAA. Because of the heavy use of the X rating by pornographers, it became associated largely with pornographic films, so that non-pornographic films given an X rating would have fewer theaters willing to book them and fewer venues for advertising. Moreover, many newspapers refused to advertise X rated films. This led to a number of films being released unrated sometimes with a warning that the film contained content for adults only. In response, the MPAA eventually agreed in 1990 to a new NC-17 rating that would be trademarked, and could only be applied by the MPAA itself. By trademarking the rating, the MPAA committed to defending a NC-17 film charged with violating obscenity laws.\nQuestion:\nWhich was the first X-rated film to win an Oscar for Best Picture?\nAnswer:\nMidnight cowboy\nPassage:\nWarren Clarke\nWarren Clarke  (26 April 1947 – 12 November 2014) was an English actor. He was known for his appearances in many films after a significant role as Dim in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and for numerous television appearances, including lead roles in the TV series Dalziel and Pascoe (as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel), The Manageress and Sleepers.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Alan James Clarke in Oldham, Lancashire, his father worked as a stained-glass maker and his mother as a secretary. \nHe left Barlow Hall Secondary Modern School, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, aged 15 and began work at the Manchester Evening News as a copy boy. He later moved on to amateur dramatics and performed at Huddersfield Rep before working as an actor full-time.  During this period he also decided to change his first name to Warren, a name he chose as his girlfriend of the time had a crush on Warren Beatty.\n\nCareer\n\nClarke's first television appearance was in the long-running Granada soap opera Coronation Street, initially as Kenny Pickup in 1966 and then as Gary Bailey in 1968. His first major film appearance was in Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (1971) where he played a 'droog' named 'Dim' opposite Malcolm McDowell. He appeared with McDowell again in the film O Lucky Man! (1973) and in the TV film Gulag (1985).\n\nClarke appeared in a wide range of roles in television and film productions including The Breaking of Bumbo (1970), Home (1970) opposite Sir Ralph Richardson and Sir John Gielgud, Charlton Heston's Antony and Cleopatra (1972), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), S.O.S. Titanic (1979), Hawk the Slayer (1980), Masada (1981), Enigma (1982), Lassiter (1984), Top Secret! (1984), Ishtar, (1987) and I.D. (1995). He played a Russian dissident in Clint Eastwood's Firefox (1982).\n\nIn Granada Television's series The Jewel in the Crown (1984) Clarke played the role of the overtly homosexual 'Sophie' Dixon, and he was Colonel Krieger in the first series of LWT's Wish Me Luck (1988). In 1989 Clarke played the Captain Lee in the film Crusoe. The same year he played the role of Martin Fisher, the chairman of a football club, in The Manageress and the role of Managing Director of an engineering firm, Vic Wilcox, in the TV adaptation of the David Lodge novel Nice Work. He also starred in an episode of Lovejoy entitled \"Bin Diving\". Clarke played Larry Patterson in Gone to the Dogs (1991), which was followed by the series Gone to Seed (1992), in which Clarke again starred.  He also appeared in Our Mutual Friend (the 1976 TV mini-series) as Bradley Headstone.\n\nIn Sleepers (1991), alongside Nigel Havers, Clarke played one of the two lead roles as two KGB sleeper agents living in Britain and leading their own lives until they are reactivated. He played Bamber in the ITV comedy-drama Moving Story (1994). His comedic talents can be seen in the one-off special Blackadder: The Cavalier Years, in which he played Oliver Cromwell, and in the episode \"Amy and Amiability\" of the series Blackadder the Third. From 1996 he appeared regularly as Detective Superintendent Andy Dalziel in the TV series Dalziel and Pascoe.  In 1997 he starred in the drama The Locksmith. \n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 Clarke played Brian Addis, a father who moved his family from the bustle of London to a Devon farm, in the BBC TV series Down to Earth. He appeared as Mr Boythorn in the BBC One dramatisation of Bleak House (2005) and starred alongside Anthony Head in the BBC Drama The Invisibles (2008) and in the Channel 4 trilogy Red Riding (2009). Around the same time, Clarke appeared as Commander Peters in the ITV production of Agatha Christie's Marple Why Didn't They Ask Evans? (2009) and the BBC series Inspector George Gently (\"Peace and Love\", 2010) and played Mr Bott in Just William (also 2010).  He guested as innkeeper Samuel Quested in Midsomer Murders (\"The Night of the Stag\", 2011) and as John Lacey in Call the Midwife (also 2011).\n\nIn 2014 he began filming Poldark as Charles Poldark. The character's final scene in the series, in episode four in which Poldark lies on his deathbed before dying, was also Clarke's own final scene as an actor: he was very ill at the time of filming and died a few weeks later, and the first episode of the television series was then dedicated to his memory.  \n\nPersonal life\n\nClarke was a keen golfer and had been a Manchester City supporter from the age of seven. \n\nClarke’s marriage to his first wife ended in divorce a few years after his parents died. They had a son together, Rowan. He also had a daughter, Georgia. \n\nOn 12 November 2014 Clarke died in his sleep, after a short illness. He is survived by his second wife Michelle, their daughter Georgia and his son.\nQuestion:\nFor playing which detective, created by Reginald Hill, on television was Warren Clarke perhaps best known?\nAnswer:\n(Detective Superintendent) Andy Dalziel\n", "answers": ["Chief inspector of prisons", "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons", "Chief Inspector of Prisons", "HM Inspector of Prisons", "(CHIEF) INSPECTOR OF PRISONS", "Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons", "HM Inspectorate of Prisons"], "length": 2599, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "649a8c0ed52d328838bf66bac9bf291fbe586df09d8ae890"}

The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals Il Caffè and Il Giorno. Each story takes a scientific \"fact\" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's t zero.\n\nAll of the stories in Cosmicomics, together with those from t zero and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, The Complete Cosmicomics (Penguin UK, 2009).\n\nThe first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html \"National Book Awards – 1969\"].

Calvino takes the fact that the Moon used to be much closer to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.\n*At Daybreak — Life before matter condenses.\n*A Sign in Space — The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of postmodern theory — that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.\n*All at One Point — The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  \"Naturally, we were all there—old Qfwfq said—where else could we have been?

The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like \"civilized\" people.\n*How Much Shall We Bet — A story about betting on the long term evolution of mankind.\n*The Dinosaurs — How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.\n*The Form of Space — As the unnamed narrator \"falls\" through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H'x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).\n*The Light Years — The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies, and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying \"I saw you.\"  Given that there's a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day, and finds out that it was something he wished to hide.

Tony Jacklin shot under-par in all four rounds on his way to a seven-stroke victory and his only U.S. Open title, the second of his two major championships. He was the first golfer born in England to win the title since Cyril Walker at the 1924 U.S. Open.\n\nJacklin led wire-to-wire and was hardly threatened throughout the championship. He took a four-shot lead over Dave Hill into the final round, and despite bogeys at the 7th and 8th, made a long birdie putt at 9 to quell any talk of a collapse. Jacklin shot a third consecutive round of 70 and a 281 total, seven clear of the field and the only player under par.\n\nOpened eight years earlier, Hazeltine was hosting its first major championship, and reviews were less than positive.

Britain took possession of the Dutch Cape colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, sparking resistance from the independence-minded Boers, who resented the Anglicization of South Africa and Britain’s anti-slavery policies. In 1833, the Boers began an exodus into African tribal territory, where they founded the republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The two new republics lived peaceably with their British neighbors until 1867, when the discovery of diamonds and gold in the region made conflict between the Boer states and Britain inevitable.\nMinor fighting with Britain began in the 1890s, and in October 1899 full-scale war ensued. By mid June 1900, British forces had captured most major Boer cities and formally annexed their territories, but the Boers launched a guerrilla war that frustrated the British occupiers. Beginning in 1901, the British began a strategy of systematically searching out and destroying these guerrilla units, while herding the families of the Boer soldiers into concentration camps. By 1902, the British had crushed the Boer resistance, and on May 31 of that year the Peace of Vereeniging was signed, ending hostilities.\nThe treaty recognized the British military administration over Transvaal and the Orange Free State and authorized a general amnesty for Boer forces. In 1910, the autonomous Union of South Africa was established by the British. It included Transvaal, the Orange Free State, the Cape of Good Hope, and Natal as provinces.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nWhat major war began on 10 October, 1899?\nAnswer:\nThe Boer War\nPassage:\nHistory of the Iron Lung or Respirator - About.com Money\nHistory of the Iron Lung or Respirator\nBy Mary Bellis\nUpdated August 06, 2016.\nBy definition the iron lung is \"an airtight metal tank that encloses all of the body except the head and forces the lungs to inhale and exhale through regulated changes in air pressure.\"\nAccording to Robert Hall author of History of the British Iron Lung, the first scientist to appreciate the mechanics of respiration was John Mayow.\nJohn Mayow\nIn 1670, John Mayow demonstrated that air is drawn into the lungs by enlarging the thoracic cavity. He built a model using bellows inside which was inserted a bladder. Expanding the bellows caused air to fill the bladder and compressing the bellows expelled air form the bladder. This was the principle of artificial respiration called \"external negative pressure ventilation\" or ENPV that would lead to the invention of the iron lung and other respirators.\nIron Lung Respirator - Philip Drinker\nThe first modern and practical respirator nicknamed the \"iron lung\" was invented by Harvard medical researchers Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw in 1927.\ncontinue reading below our video\nWhat to Do If Your Identity is Stolen\nThe inventors used an iron box and two vacuum cleaners to build their prototype respirator. Almost the length of a subcompact car, the iron lung exerted a push-pull motion on the chest.\nIn 1927, the first iron lung was installed at Bellevue hospital in New York City. The first patients of the iron lung were polio sufferers with chest paralysis.\nLater, John Emerson improved upon Philip Drinkers invention and invented an iron lung that cost half as much to manufacture.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name for the negative pressure generator invented by Robert Henderson and used extensively by Phillip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw?\nAnswer:\nNegative pressure ventilator\nPassage:\nAlpine skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics – Men's downhill\nThe Men's Downhill competition of the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid was held at Whiteface Mountain on Thursday, February 14.\n\nThe defending world champion was Josef Walcher of Austria, while Switzerland's Peter Müller was the defending World Cup downhill champion and led the 1980 World Cup.\nDefending Olympic champion Franz Klammer did not compete; he was not selected to the Austrian Olympic team in 1980.\n\nGold medalist Leonhard Stock was an alternate on the Austrian downhill team, at the Olympics for the slalom.

It is the site of a number of now-defunct sardine canning factories. The last cannery closed in 1973. The street name, formerly a nickname for Ocean View Avenue, became official in January 1958 to honor John Steinbeck and his well-known novel Cannery Row.  In the novel's opening sentence, Steinbeck described the street as \"a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.\"\n\nHistory\n\nCannery Row was the setting of John Steinbeck's novels Cannery Row (1945) and Sweet Thursday (1954). Both were the basis for the 1982 movie Cannery Row, starring Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.  It is also mentioned in Bob Dylan's song \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\".\nPacific Biological Laboratories, a biological supply house, was located at 800 Ocean View Avenue (now 800 Cannery Row) from 1928 to 1948, and operated by Edward F. Ricketts, who was the inspiration for several characters in Steinbeck novels. The laboratory is still preserved. Across from the laboratory still exists a Chinese-American-owned store mentioned in both Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, as well as a vacant lot that was the \"home\" of some of the homeless characters in the novel.\n\nThe canneries failed after the collapse of the fishing industry in Monterey Bay in the mid-1950s, which resulted from a combination of factors, including unfavorable oceanic conditions, over-fishing, and competition from other species.   In his investigation of where the sardines had gone, Ed Ricketts finally concluded \"They're in cans.\" Before the collapse, the fishery was one of the most productive in the world due to the upwelling of cold, yet nutrient-rich water from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean that is funneled to the surface via the vast underwater Monterey Canyon.\n\nOld Hovden Cannery steam boilers\n\nToday\n\nToday the area offshore from Cannery Row is the Edward F. Ricketts State Marine Conservation Area (part of the larger Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary)   and is home to a large resurgent population of California sea lions. \n\nCannery Row itself is now a tourist attraction with many restaurants and hotels, several of which are located in former cannery buildings, and a few historic attractions. Some privately owned fishing companies still exist on Cannery Row, housed on piers located a short distance from the historic district frequented by tourists. \n\nIn recent years, Cannery Row has become increasingly popular among sport fishermen due to extensive public fishing facilities. MacAbee Beach and San Carlos Beach, which bookend Cannery Row  are both popular spots for kayak-launching; San Carlos Beach is one of Monterey Bay's most popular scuba-diving spots.\n\nThe Monterey Bay Aquarium (opened 1984) is located at the north end of Cannery Row, at the former site of the major Hovden Cannery. Norwegian immigrant Knut Hovden founded Hovden Food Products Corporation which opened on July 7, 1916. By canning squid at the end of its life, Hovden Cannery managed to outlast its neighbors, finally closing its doors in 1973 when it became the last cannery on the row to close.\nQuestion:\nWho wrote the novel Cannery Row?\nAnswer:\nJohn Steinbeck III\nPassage:\nBridge of Sighs (Oxford)\nHertford Bridge, popularly known as the Bridge of Sighs, is a skyway joining two parts of Hertford College over New College Lane in Oxford, England. Its distinctive design makes it a city landmark.\n\nMisnomer and myth \n\nThe bridge is often referred to as the Bridge of Sighs because of its supposed similarity to the famous Bridge of Sighs in Venice. However, Hertford Bridge was never intended to be a replica of the Venetian bridge, and indeed it bears a closer resemblance to the Rialto Bridge in the same city.\n\nThere is a false legend saying that many decades ago, a survey of the health of students was taken, and as Hertford College's students were the heaviest, the college closed off the bridge to force them to take the stairs, giving them extra exercise. However, if the bridge is not used, the students actually climb fewer stairs than if they do use the bridge. \n\nBuilding \n\nThe bridge links together the Old and New Quadrangles of Hertford College (to the south and the north respectively), and much of its current architecture was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson.  It was completed in 1914, despite its construction being opposed by New College.\n\nThe building on the southern side of the bridge houses the College's administrative offices, whereas the northern building is mostly student accommodation. The bridge is always open to members of the College, who can often be seen crossing it.\nQuestion:\nIn which foreign city would you be if you were walking over the Bridge of Sighs\nAnswer:\nSestiere (Venice)\n", "answers": ["Almond tree", "Luz (nut)", "Amygdalus amara", "Almond oil", "Marcona almonds", "Mandel (nut)", "Badam", "Almond Bitter Oil", "Prunus dulcis", "Almond trees", "Amygdalus communis", "Almendrado", "Amygdalus dulcis", "Marcona Almonds", "Prunus amygdalus dulcis", "Druparia amygdalus", "Marcona almond", "Marcona Almond", "Prunus amygdalus", "Almond extract", "Amygdalus fragilis", "Amygdalus sativa", "Baadaam", "Oil of bitter almond", "Toasted Almond", "Oleum amygdalae", "Bitter almonds", "Sweet almond oil", "Almond", "لوز", "Almonds", "Oil of Bitter Almonds", "Almond syrup", "Bitter almond"], "length": 2960, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "58cff152249fc6c5b994bf016d4fe88a54d016459b46e86d"}

The company closed its final salary scheme to new members in 2002, but this was not enough to stem rising deficits at the fund due partly to falling share prices and partly to rising long term liabilities and increased longevity.\nAmong the plans to be closed is the Mirror Group fund, which was the victim of former proprietor Robert Maxwell's grab.\nThe scheme has 3,000 active members, and they will now be transferred to a defined-contributions scheme, in which their pension payout is related to the amount they put in, as opposed to a fixed amount related to their salary at the end of their careers. As such, pensions will invariably be less generous than under the previous system.\nPaul Holleran of the National Union of Journalists said: \"The scrapping of the final-salary scheme is the latest in a long line of attacks on staff at Trinity Mirror and serious questions need to be asked and answered about the capability of the senior Trinity\ndirectors.\"\nThe group owns five national newspapers, more than 120 regional titles and over 400 digital products, but has struggled in the face of the recession and a sharp fall in advertising revenues.\nThe Daily Mail's owner Daily Mail and General Trust recently shut its own final salary scheme to new members, and the number of defined benefit schemes throughout the private sector is falling fast.\nThe pair are not the only newspaper groups to be struggling. The Observer – the Sunday newspaper owned by the Guardian Media Group – is set from next week to reduce the number of sections to only four. The Scott Trust, the charity that owns GMG, ruled out shutting the title and replacing it with a Guardian-branded edition.\nIts staff will learn which magazines and sections – and how many full-time staff – will survive this week,\nQuestion:\nWho was the owner of Mirror Group newspapers who misused the pension fund\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nTake Your Pick!\nTake Your Pick! was a United Kingdom game show originally broadcast by Radio Luxembourg in the early 1950s. The show transferred to television in 1955 with the launch of ITV, where it continued until 1968. As it was the first game show broadcast on commercial television in the UK (and the BBC did not at that point offer monetary prizes on its game shows), it was also by default the first British game show to offer cash prizes.The programme was later revived from 24 February 1992 to 28 August 1998.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first television version was produced by Associated-Rediffusion (later Rediffusion London), while the revival was made by Thames Television (whose arrival as the new London weekday ITV company had led to the original show's demise).\n\nIf they got through the \"Yes-No Interlude\" (in which they had to answer a series of questions without using the words \"yes\" or \"no\" or be gonged off the stage), contestants would answer questions to win modest monetary prizes and at the climax of the show had to decide whether to \"take the money\" or \"open the box\". The box could contain good prizes (for the time), such as a holiday or a washing machine, but could also contain booby prizes such as a mousetrap or a bag of sweets.\n\nThe first version was hosted by Michael Miles (after its demise, Miles hosted a similar show for Southern Television called Wheel of Fortune, not to be confused with the later Wheel of Fortune of the same title). Bob Danvers-Walker, the voice of Pathé News from 1940 until its demise in 1970, was the show's announcer, and Alec Dane was on hand to bang the gong. At the electronic organ was Harold Smart.\n\nDes O'Connor became the host for the second version in the 1990s. His future wife Jodie Wilson was one of the hostesses; she would later be replaced by Neighbours twins Gayle and Gillian Blakeney.\n\nIt was revived again for one night only as part of Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon in 2005, a series of the Geordie duo presenting classic ITV gameshows as part of the channel's 50th anniversary in their own style.\n\nA similar formula was used for Pot of Gold, another game show, hosted by O'Connor.\n\nThe Des O'Connor series is currently being repeated on Challenge.\n\nThe game was played during the ninth series of Britain's Got More Talent.\n\nYes/No interlude\n\nIn this opening game, the host asked the contestant a series of questions for 60 seconds and the contestant could not say yes, no, nod or shake their heads. If they did, the co-host would bang the gong and the contestant would be eliminated (unless other contestants did the same).\n\nBox numbers and the prizes\n\nThere were 10 boxes numbered from 1 to 10 and an additional Box 13. Of the former, there were 3 boxes containing booby prizes, 1 containing a star prize (e.g. a small car) and 6 containing other prizes (of which 1 was a \"treasure chest\" of cash). One box also included the option to choose Box 13. The host offered an alternative prize of up to about £50 (or, in the revival, a number of hundreds of pounds) in cash and the contestant had to choose between \"taking the money\" and \"opening the box\".\n\nIn this game, the contestant might answer 3 out of 4 questions correctly before the contestant picks the boxes from 1 to 10 and activating box 13 within the 10 boxes like cinema tickets, baby food,cowboy hats or pork pies which relates to a prize, but also with larger prizes containing such as television sets, video players, cash, karaoke machines, double beds, music vouchers & sofas and booby prizes containing nose hair trimmers, last night's cold food, a box of chocolates, breakfast cereals, rotten tomatoes, cat food and dog food and the star prizes containing kitchen appliances, cars, motorbikes, jet skis, hotels, computers and holidays.\n\nCultural references\n\nA sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus (called \"Spot the Brain Cell\" in a later audio version) has John Cleese  playing an \"evil\" game show host, hitting contestants over the head with a giant hammer, which is clearly a wildly exaggerated version of Michael Miles (the game he is hosting is a parody of the \"Yes-No Interlude\" from Take Your Pick!). An early version of this sketch appeared in At Last the 1948 Show. For a time after Miles' death the sketch was not shown by the BBC, but it has since been reinstated.\n\nAlso, in the Hungarian Tourist sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus, a prosecutor (played by Eric Idle) plays the game with Alexander Yalt (played by Michael Palin). The prosecutor manages to gong Yalt \"out\" for answering a question with \"yes\" (although, Yalt was probably unaware of playing the game in the first place).\n\nA sketch in the BBC Radio comedy series The Burkiss Way featured a \"Dinosaur-Cheese Interlude\", in which contestants were required to answer questions without mentioning any species of dinosaur or any variety of cheese (besides Edam, which was \"made\" backwards). Naturally, all the contestants did accidentally mention them.\n\nA fifth season episode of the radio show Hancock's Half Hour (broadcast May 1958) had Tony Hancock appear on the (unnamed) show and win £4,000.\n\nThe British progressive rock band Hatfield and the North named one of their songs \"The Yes No Interlude\". It is included in their second LP, The Rotters' Club.\n\nThe 1970s radio programme I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again made frequent references to Take Your Pick with phrases such as \"Stake the bunny!\" \"Open the box!\"\n\nTransmissions\n\nAssociated-Rediffusion\n\nOnly 6 out of the 494 episodes from the Associated-Rediffusion era survived from the archives including Episode 2 of Series 1, Episode 39 of Series 10, Episodes 1-2 of Series 12 and Episodes 18 & 44 of Series 13. \n\nThames\nQuestion:\nWhich New Zealander presented Take Your Pick on radio and TV\nAnswer:\nMichael Miles\nPassage:\nTrophies - The Championships, Wimbledon 2016 - Official ...\nTrophies - The Championships, Wimbledon 2017 - Official Site by IBM\nInformation about the five Championship trophies. READ MORE\nGentlemen's Singles Championship\nGentlemen's Singles Trophy first presented by the All England Club in 1887. It replaced the Field Cup (1877-1883) and the Challenge Cup (1884-1886) which were both won by William Renshaw after twice winning the gentlemen's title three times in succession. The AELTC spent 100 guineas to purchase a trophy as the Club was not prepared to risk losing a third Cup to a future three-times Champion so the decision was taken that the new trophy would never become the property of the winner.\nThe Cup, which is made of silver gilt, stands 18 inches high and has a diameter of 7.5 inches. The inscription on the Cup reads: \"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World\".\nAround the bowl are engraved the dates and names of the Champions. In 2009, there being no space left to engrave the names of the Champions, a black plinth with an ornamented silver band was designed to accompany the Cup. The Champions receive a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 13.5 inches).\nLadies' Singles Championship\nThe Ladies' Singles Trophy is a silver salver, sometimes referred to as the Rosewater Dish or Venus Rosewater Dish, which was first presented to the Champion when the challenge round was introduced in 1886.\nThe salver, which is made of sterling silver, partly gilded, is 18.75 inches in diameter. The theme of the decoration is mythological. The central boss has a figure of Temperance, seated on a chest with a lamp in her right hand and a jug in her left, with various attributes such as a sickle, fork and caduceus around her.\nThe four reserves on the boss of the dish each contain a classical god, together with elements. The reserves around the rim show Minerva presiding over the seven liberal arts: astrology, geometry, arithmetic, music, rhetoric, dialectic and grammar, each with relevant attribute.\nThe rim of the salver has an ovolo moulding. The Champions receive a three-quarter size replica of the Cup bearing the names of all past Champions (height 14 inches).\nDoubles and Mixed Championships\nThe Gentlemen's Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup for the Gentlemen's Pairs' competition. When the doubles moved to Wimbledon in 1884 the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club presented the trophy to the All England Club.\nThe Ladies' Doubles Trophy is an elegant silver cup and cover, known as The Duchess of Kent Challenge Cup, presented to the Club in 1949 by HRH The Princess Marina, President of the All England Club.\nThe Mixed Doubles Trophy is a silver challenge cup and cover presented to the All England Club by the family of the late S.H. Smith. S.H. Smith won the doubles title in 1902 and 1906, in partnership with the late F.L.

It is considered to be a subcontinent, rather than being a part of either continent. There are seven countries in this region called; Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Belize. Central America covers about 534,000 km2 (202,000 sq mi), which is just 0.1% of the Earth’s surface! Despite this fact, Central America is home to the 19th largest lake in the world (by area). Let’s find out the name of this lake and where it is located.\nWhat is the largest lake in Central America?\nThe largest lake in Central America is Lake Nicaragua (Spanish: Lago de Nicaragua), also known as Cocibolca or Granada. Lake Nicaragua has a total surface area of 8,264 km2 (3,191 sq mi). The lake is not overly deep with a maximum depth of 26 m (85 ft). It drains from west to east into the Caribbean Sea via the San Juan River.\nAs the name suggests, Lake Nicaragua is located entirely within the country of Nicaragua. This lake is located in the southwest of the country close to the border with Costa Rica.\nDid you know?\nNicaragua is also home to Lake Managua, which is the second largest lake in Central America. Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua are sometimes connected via the Tipitapa River. Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, lies on the southwestern shore of Lake Managua.\nPlans were once may to made a canal between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, the Panama canal was built instead and plans for the Nicaragua were put on hold.

The series \"C\", which was introduced in 1949, had a 998 cc 50 degree OHV V-twin engine running a 7.3:1 compression ratio.\n\nModel history\n\nThe first model from Vincent was the Rapide, followed by the Black Shadow in response to a demand for a more \"sports oriented model\". The Black Shadow was developed from an early-model Rapide that had been specially tuned by factory tester and racer George Brown, his brother Cliff and designer Phil Irving.  With relatively minor modifications, such as enlarged ports, bigger carburettors and increased compression, the test model, known as \"Gunga Din\", gave 55 bhp, creating the basis for the Black Shadow.  The Black Shadow  proved very popular and its production overtook the Rapide. The Black Shadow's engine, instead of being cradled in a set of frame rails, was suspended from above, becoming a stressed member, or integral part, of the structure. \n\nThe Black Shadow featured several new technological innovations, such as: an original alternative to the primitive telescopic front forks of the day, a sprung rear sub-frame, extensive use of aluminium alloy, and a unit construction stressed engine. Overall weight was a relatively light 458 lb.   While other contemporary motorcycles tended to be polished and chromed, the \"Black Shadow\" was unusual in being predominantly black. The black enamel crankcase was effective both for marketing and heat dissipation.  Some 16 \"White Shadows\" were built, made to Shadow specification but with the Rapide's plain aluminium finish.  Fewer than 1,700  Vincent Black Shadows were made,  all hand-assembled.\n\nIn 2007, The Vincent H.R.D. Owners Club commissioned the VOC Spares Company Limited to build a replica Black Shadow from new parts. Among other things, the project was to prove that all the parts were in stock and available from the VOC Spares Company Limited.

It is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction.  Mina De La O, Getty Images\nUpdated August 02, 2016.\nVelocity Definition\nVelocity is defined as a vector measurement of the rate and direction of motion or, in other terms, the rate and direction of the change in the position of an object. The scalar (absolute value) magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed of the motion. In calculus terms, velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time.\nThe most common way to calculate the constant velocity of an object moving in a straight line is with the formula:\nr = d / t\nwhere\nr is the rate, or speed (sometimes denoted as v, for velocity, as in this kinematics article )\nd is the distance moved\nt is the time it takes to complete the movement\nUnits of Velocity\nThe SI units for velocity are m / s (meters per second). It may be expressed in any units of distance per time. Other units include miles per hour (mph), kilometers per hour (kph), and kilometers per second (km/s).\nSample Velocity Problem\nA physics student drops an egg off an extremely tall building.\ncontinue reading below our video\n4 Tips for Improving Test Performance\nWhat is the egg's velocity after 2.60 seconds?\nThe hardest part about solving for velocity in a physics problem is selecting the right equation. In this case, two equations may be used to solve the problem.\nUsing the equation:\nd = vI*t + 0.5*a*t2\nwhere d is distance, vI is initial velocity, t is time, a is acceleration (due to gravity, in this case)\nd = (0 m/s)*(2.60 s) + 0.5*(-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)2\nd = -33.1 m (negative sign indicates direction downward)\nNext, you can plug in this distance value to solve for velocity using the equation:\nvf = vi + a*t\nwhere vf is final velocity, vi is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time. Since the egg was dropped and not thrown, the initial velocity is 0.\nvf = 0 + (-9.8 m/s2)(2.60 s)\nvf = -25.5 m/s\nAlthough it's common to report velocity as a simple value, remember it's a vector and has direction as well as magnitude. Usually, moving upward is indicated with a positive sign, and down carries a negative sign.\nRelating Velocity, Speed, and Acceleration\nSpeed, velocity, and acceleration are all related to each other. Remember:\nSpeed is a scalar quantity that indicates rate of motion distance per time. Its units are length/time.\nVelocity is a vector quantity that indicates distance per time and direction. Like speed, its units are length/time, but direction is also cited.\nAcceleration is a vector quantity that indicates the rate of change of velocity. It has dimensions of length/time2.\nQuestion:\nIn physics, 'the rate of change of position' is a basic definition of what term?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nParrothead\nParrot Head or Parrothead is a commonly used nickname for fans of Jimmy Buffett. \"Parakeets\"  or \"Keets\" is the term used for younger fans of Jimmy, or children of Parrotheads.\n\nOrigin of the term\n\nThe term \"Parrot Head\" was coined in 1985 at a Jimmy Buffett concert at the Timberwolf Amphitheater in Cincinnati, OH.  Buffett has said numerous times that he attributes much of his fame to this area. At the show, Jimmy commented about everyone wearing Hawaiian shirts and parrot hats and how they kept coming back to see his shows, just like Deadheads. Timothy B. Schmit, then a member of the Coral Reefer Band, coined the term \"Parrot Head\" to describe each of those fans.\n\nActivities\n\nEvents range from single act concerts or happy hours to the annual Meeting of the Minds in Key West, Florida, which attracts approximately 3,500 Parrotheads each year.  The several day event, sponsored by the Parrot Heads in Paradise includes live music, but also a Toy Drive for the Monroe County Salvation Army, a blood drive, Zonta Walk for Breast Cancer, raffles and other events to raise money for charities. Some regional groups will focus on one or two key charities, while others may switch between several.  Environmental causes, cancer research, Alzheimer's research and the March of Dimes all have received large donations from Parrothead organizations.  In 2011, there were 239 Parrothead Club chapters in the United States, Canada and Australia, spanning 3 different countries, 47 states and 3 Canadian provinces. The total membership in 2011 was almost 28,000 members. In the ten-year period 2002-2011, member clubs of the international Parrothead organization raised over $26.2M to support charitable organizations, and collectively worked almost 2.9 million hours of community service.

Kevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThis week two people in the tech industry lost their jobs because of jokes gone awry at a conference.\nA couple of male developers were joking around about \"big\"   dongles. When a female developer evangelist heard their jokes she   tweeted it out with their photo, complaining that they were being   rude. One of those developers lost his job, and then eventually,   so did the evangelist.\nIn the developers' defense, the word \"dongle\" is funny. It's   nearly impossible to say without giggling or making childish   jokes.\nSome people in our office had heard the word before, but didn't   know what a dongle is. Merriam-Webster  defines   a dongle as a small device that plugs into a computer and   serves as an adapter or a security measure to enable the use of   certain software.\nKevin   Smith/Business Insider\nThe term, dongle, was rumored to have originated from a 1992   advertisement for Rainbow Technologies. The ad claimed the word   dongle was derived from the name \"Don Gall.\" Though untrue, this   has given rise to an urban myth, we learned from Wikipedia .\nAccording to the University of   Pennsylvania's language log , the earliest citation of the   word dongle began appearing in 1982:\n1982   MicroComputer   Printout  Jan. 19/2 The word ‘dongle’ has been   appearing in many articles with reference to security systems for   computer software [refers to alleged coinage in 1980].\nBut as the term 'dongle' became more widespread its meaning   changed from strictly a scientific term to mainstream. UPenn   clarifies:\nThe current meaning   for dongle seems   to be something like \"a self-contained device that plugs into   a  port on a computer that is normally used for connections   to a separate external device\". Thus in addition to the original   serial-port dongles, and the USB dongles that Suzanne (and   Stephen Fry) wrote about, there are also  \"firewire   dongles\" , and presumably there could be dongles for any   other sort of port as well. \nSimply put, dongles are computer peripherals that plug into   your computer like a USB flash drive or a cord connecting a   computer with a printer for example.  Dongles are also huge in the video game   world because they allow consoles to have added features like   increased audio quality.\nAn Xbox 360 Audio Dongle Wikimedia   Commons\nBefore USB was the standard in   attaching PC peripherals, there were tons of different dongles   that came in various shapes and sizes.\nQuestion:\nIn computing, what is the device which is plugged into a computer which serves as an adapter or to enable the use of certain software?\nAnswer:\nDongle\nPassage:\nEast Anglian Daily Times\nThe East Anglian Daily Times is a British local newspaper for Suffolk and Essex, based in Ipswich.\n\nIt started publication on 13 October 1874,  incorporating the Ipswich Express, which had been published since 13 August 1839.

It was only his third race for Williams.\nWilliams' cars have carried his name ever since the tragedy at the Imola racing circuit, and Bruno, who made his debut for HRT in 2010, says he is excited to follow in his uncle's footsteps.\nFerrari's Alonso slams F1 testing rules\n\"It will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with Ayrton,\" the 28-year-old told Williams' website.\n\"Hopefully we can bring back some memories and create some great new ones too. I also want to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today.\n\"I am very proud to be Brazilian and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what I can do. Ever since I first sat in a go-kart I never wanted to do anything else.\"\nTeam principal Frank Williams, who was in charge of Williams when Ayrton Senna died, said he was looking forward to seeing Bruno compete at the highest level.\nThe driver struggled with HRT in the team's debut season, then moved to Renault as a reserve driver before replacing Nick Heidfeld for the final eight races of 2011, but scored points in just one of his eight races as he finished ninth at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\"The circumstances of Bruno's two seasons in Formula One have not given him an ideal opportunity to deliver consistently so it was essential that we spent as much time with him as possible to understand and evaluate him as a driver,\" he said.\n\"We have done this both on track and in our simulator and he has proven quick, technically insightful and above all capable of learning and applying his learning quickly and consistently.

Simply fill out this order form .\nWhere did the idea come from?\nIn 1991 – a decade after the emergence of HIV – a group of 12 artists gathered to discuss a new project for Visual Aids; a New York arts organisation that raises awareness of HIV. They were photographers, painters, film makers and costume designers, and they sat around in the shared gallery space in New York's East Village.\nAfter a short brainstorm they had come up with a simple idea that later became one of the most recognised symbols of the decade – the red ribbon, worn to signify awareness and support for people living with HIV.\nPhotos courtesy of The Elizabeth Taylor Archive\nWhy did we need a symbol?\nWhen the artists sat down to work on this project, their aim was to get people talking about HIV. This was during a time where HIV was highly stigmatised and people living with the virus were suffering behind closed doors, some too scared to even tell their loved ones. The artists wanted to create a visual expression of compassion for people living with, and affected by, HIV.\nThe artists were inspired by the yellow ribbons tied on trees to show support for the US military fighting in the Gulf War. Pink and rainbow stripes were rejected because they were too closely associated with the gay community, and they wanted to convey that HIV went beyond the gay community and was relevant to everyone.\nRed was chosen as it is bold and visible – symbolising passion, a heart and love. The shape was chosen simply because it was easy to make and replicate – anyone can make one by just cutting out a piece of ribbon, looping it around your finger and pinning it on themselves.\nHow did the red ribbon become so well known?\nIn the early days, the artists made the ribbons themselves and distributed them around the New York art scene and dropped them off at theatres. Initially there was text that went with it, to explain why they were being worn, but eventually this was dropped as its symbolism no longer needed an explanation.\nWithin weeks of the red ribbon idea being born, world-famous actors starting wearing it to high-profile award ceremonies such as the Oscars and talking about why it was important. The media also took notice, and within a short space of time the red ribbon symbol became universally recognised.\nAt the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, held at London's Wembley Stadium on Easter Sunday, 1992, more than 100,000 red ribbons were distributed among the audience, with performers such as George Michael wearing one. The red ribbon continues to be a powerful force in the efforts to increase public awareness of HIV.\nConnect with us\nQuestion:\nWhat emblem was adopted in 1991 as a symbol of AIDS awareness?

Debates over its meaning and origin have largely centered on attempts to match the old woman with historical female figures who have had large families, although King George II (1683–1760) has also been proposed as the rhyme's subject.\n\nLyrics\n\nThe most common version of the rhyme is:\n\nThe earliest printed version in Joseph Ritson's Gammer Gurton's Garland in 1794 has the coarser last line:\n\nMany other variations were printed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Marjorie Ainsworth Decker published a Christian version of the rhyme in her The Christian Mother Goose Book published in 1978:\n\nOrigins and meaning\n\nIona and Peter Opie pointed to the version published in Infant Institutes in 1797, which finished with the lines:\n\nThe term \"a-loffeing\", they believe, was Shakespearean, suggesting that the rhyme is considerably older than the first printed versions. They then speculated that if this were true, it might have a folklore meaning and pointed to the connection between shoes and fertility, perhaps exemplified by casting a shoe after a bride as she leaves for her honeymoon, or tying shoes to the departing couple's car. Archaeologist Ralph Merifield has pointed out that in Lancashire it was the custom for females who wished to conceive to try on the shoes of a woman who had just given birth.\n\nDebates over the meaning of the rhyme have largely revolved around matching the old woman with historical figures, as Peter Opie observed \"for little reason other than the size of their families\". Candidates include:\n*Queen Caroline, the wife of King George II (1683–1760), who had eight children.\n*Elizabeth Vergoose of Boston, who had six children of her own and ten stepchildren.\n\nAlbert Jack has proposed a political origin for the rhyme. George II was nicknamed the \"old woman\", because it was widely believed that Queen Caroline was the real power behind the throne. According to this explanation, the children are the Members of Parliament (MPs) that George was unable to control, the whip refers to the political office of that name – the MP whose role is to ensure that members of his party vote according to the party line – and the bed is the House of Commons, which MPs were required to attend daily. The phrase \"gave them some broth without any bread\" may refer to George's parsimony in the wake of the South Sea Bubble of 1721, and his attempts to restore his own and the country's finances.\nQuestion:\n\"Where did the old woman who \"\"had so many children she didn't know what to do\"\" live?\"\nAnswer:\nOrthopaedic footwear\nPassage:\nKolossi Castle\nKolossi Castle is a former Crusader stronghold on the south-west edge of Kolossi village 14 km west of the city of Limassol on the island of Cyprus.  It held great strategic importance in the Middle Ages, and contained large facilities for the production of sugar from the local sugarcane, one of Cyprus's main exports in the period. The original castle was possibly built in 1210 by the Frankish military, when the land of Kolossi was given by King Hugh I to the Knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (Hospitallers). \n\nThe present castle was built in 1454 by the Hospitallers under the Commander of Kolossi, Louis de Magnac, whose arms can be seen carved into the castle's walls. \n\nOwing to rivalry among the factions in the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus, the castle was taken by the Knights Templar in 1306, but returned to the Hospitallers in 1313 following the abolition of the Templars. \n\nThe castle today consists of a single three-storey keep with an attached rectangular enclosure or bailey about 30 by. \n\nAs well as its sugar. the area is also known for its sweet wine, Commandaria.  At the wedding banquet after King Richard the Lionheart's marriage to Berengaria of Navarre at nearby Limassol, he allegedly declared it to be the \"wine of kings and the king of wines.\"  It has been produced in the region for millennia, and is thought to be the oldest continually-produced and named wine in the world, known for centuries as \"Commandaria\" after the Templars' Grand Commandery there.    \n\nIn literature\n\nKolossi Castle appears in many works of fiction, including La milicia de Dios by the Spanish writer Eduardo García-Ontiveros Cerdeño. It also appears in Snow Wasted by the Cypriot author Matthew Malekos and in the novels of several British writers, including Race of Scorpions: The House of Noccolo by Dorothy Dunnett, In Search of Sixpence by Michael Paraskos and Lionheart by  Stewart Binns.\n \nGallery\n\nFile:KolossiCastle2.jpg|A hall inside the castle\nFile:LusignanCoatOfArms.jpg|Lusignan escutcheon on the eastern wall\nFile:Escutcheon of Kolossi Castle01.JPG|Lusignan escutcheon of Kolossi Castle\nFile:Kolossi Castle05.JPG|Fireplace, Kolossi Castle\nFile:Kolossi Castle06.JPG|Fireplace, Kolossi Castle, lily bas-relief (Fleur-de-lis)\nFile:Kolossi Castle01.JPG|Inside Kolossi Castle window view\nFile:Kolossi Castle04.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins (Sugar Factory)\nFile:Kolossi Castle03.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins\nFile:Kolossi Castle02.JPG|Kolossi Castle ruins\nFile:Kolossi Castle view.JPG|View from top of Kolossi Castle\nFile:Festung Kolossi 063.jpg|South-east view of Kolossi Castle\nFile:KOLOSSI 01.jpg|South-east view of Kolossi Castle\nQuestion:\nOn which holiday island is Kolossi Castle built by the Knights Templar in the 13th century?\nAnswer:\nCulture of Cyprus\nPassage:\nPianist\nA pianist ( , ) is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ.\n\nPianists past and present\n\nModern classical pianists dedicate their careers to performing, recording, teaching, researching as well as learning new works/expanding their repertoire. They generally do not write or transcribe music as pianists did in the 19th century. Some classical pianists might specialize in accompaniment and chamber music while others (relatively few) will perform as full-time piano soloists.\n\nClassical \n\nMozart could be considered the first \"concert pianist\" as he performed widely on the piano. Composers Beethoven and Clementi from the classical era were also famed for their playing, as were, from the romantic era,  Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn and Rachmaninoff. From that era, leading performers less known as composers were Clara Schumann and Hans von Bülow. However, as we do not have modern audio recordings of most of these pianists, we rely mainly on written commentary to give us an account of their technique and style.\n\nJazz \n\nJazz pianists almost always perform with other musicians. Their playing is freer than that of  classical pianists and they create an air of spontaneity in their performances. They generally do not write down their compositions; improvisation is a significant part of their work. Well known Jazz pianists include Art Tatum, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Oscar Peterson and Herbie Hancock.\n\nPopular pianists might work as live performers (concert, theatre, etc.), session musicians, arrangers most likely feel at home with synthesizers and other electronic keyboard instruments. Notable popular pianists include Victor Borge who performed as a comedian; Richard Clayderman, who is known for his covers of popular tunes; and singer and entertainer Liberace, who at the height of his fame, was one of the highest paid entertainers in the world.\n\nWell known pianists\n\nA single listing of pianists in all genres would be impractical, given the multitude of musicians noted for their performances on the instrument.  Below are links to lists of well-known or influential pianists divided by genres:\n\nClassical pianists\n\n*List of classical pianists (recorded)\n*List of classical pianists\n*List of classical piano duos (performers)\n\nJazz pianists\n\n*List of jazz pianists\n\nPop and rock music pianists\n\n*List of pop and rock pianists\n\nBlues pianists\n\n*List of blues musicians\n*List of boogie woogie musicians\n\nGospel pianists\n\n*List of gospel musicians\n\nNew-age pianists\n\n*List of new-age music artists\n\nPianists-composers\n\nMany important composers were also virtuoso pianists.

As a result, there are prominent communities of amateur pianists all over the world that play at quite a high level and give concerts just because of their love to music, but not to earn money.  The International Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs, held annually in Paris, attracts about one thousand listeners each year and is broadcast on French radio. It is also a notable fact that Jon Nakamatsu, the Gold Medal winner of the prestigious Van Cliburn International Piano Competition for professional pianists in Fort Worth, Texas (1997) was at the moment of his victory technically an amateur: he never attended a music conservatory or major in music, and worked as a high school German teacher then. It was only after the competition that he started pursuing a career as a classical pianist.\n\nThe German pianist Davide Martello is known for travelling around conflict zones to play his moving piano. Martello has previously been recognised by the European parliament for his “outstanding contribution to European cooperation and the promotion of common values”.[http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/paris-attacks-john-lennon-imagine-pianist-davide-martello-klavierkunst]\nQuestion:\nWhich composer and pianist, usually included as one of the Three B's of classical music, wrote A German Requiem ?\nAnswer:\nBrahm's\nPassage:\nBeamer (cricket)\nIn the terminology of the game of cricket, a beamer (less commonly beam ball) is a type of delivery in which the ball (bowled at a fast pace), without bouncing, passes above the batsman's waist height.   Such a ball is often dangerously close to the batsman's head, due to the lack of control a bowler has over high full tosses.  Worse, the batsman is expecting the ball to pitch on the wicket and therefore may not pick up the flight of the ball and may be struck by it.\n\nThis type of delivery can result in injuries to the batsman, and the penalty for this type of delivery is an immediate no-ball signal given by the umpire and a free hit (In t20s and ODIs) . The use of beamers is governed under Law 42.6.  The bowler is then given a warning by the umpire for dangerous bowling. Repeated or deliberate cases may result in the bowler being barred from bowling again for the remainder of the innings (or match), as happened with Waqar Younis in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Fast or express bowlers, particularly younger players yet to fully refine their techniques, are likely to bowl such deliveries more often than other bowlers, albeit accidentally.\n\nA beamer can severely injure a batsman, especially if the batsman's head is struck. Some cricket boards are considering introducing additional penalties in the form of monetary fines for the bowler if any batsman is injured as a result of this delivery.\n\nA bowler can legally target the batsman with a ball aimed at his head that bounces, called a bouncer. These are much easier to play or avoid than beamers.\n\nTypically a beamer is quite hard to bowl because the ball is usually released very early on in the action. Beamers are sometimes bowled when the ball is wet and it slips out of the bowler's hand.  Some excuses given have been that it was an attempted yorker that slipped but this is generally not the case as a yorker is delivered much later in the action.\n\nAbdur Rehman, a Pakistani spin bowler, bowled three consecutive beamers in the 2014 Asia Cup against Bangladesh, and was banned from the match without actually bowling a single legal ball, despite giving away 8 runs. This was the first time this happened in the history of cricket.\nQuestion:\nBeamer, Flipper and Rabbit are terms used in which sport?\nAnswer:\nCricket games\nPassage:\nBritish Classic Races\nThe British Classics are five long-standing Group 1 horse races run during the traditional flat racing season. They are restricted to three-year-old horses and traditionally represent the pinnacle of achievement for racehorses against their own age group. As such, victory in any classic marks a horse as amongst the very best of a generation. Victory in two or even three of the series (a rare feat known as the English Triple Crown) marks a horse as truly exceptional.\n\nRaces\n\nThe five British Classics are:\n\nIt is common to think of them as taking place in three legs.\n\nThe first leg is made up of the Newmarket Classics – 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas. Given that the 1,000 Guineas is restricted to fillies, this is regarded as the fillies' classic and the 2,000, which is open to both sexes, as the colts' classic, although it is theoretically possible for a filly to compete in both.\n\nThe second leg is made up of the Epsom Derby and/or Oaks, both ridden over 1 1/2 miles at Epsom in early June. The Oaks is regarded as the fillies' classic, the Derby as the colts', although, as with the Guineas, a filly could theoretically contest both.\n\nThe final leg is the St. Leger, held over 1 mile 6 1/2 furlongs at Doncaster and is open to both sexes.\n\nThe variety of distances and racecourses faced in the Classics make them particularly challenging as a series to even the best horses. It is rare for a horse to possess both the speed and stamina to compete across all these distances, making the Triple Crown a particularly notable achievement. In fact, in the modern era, it is rare for any attempt on the Triple Crown to be made.\n\nHistory\n\nAlthough the oldest race in the series, the St Leger, was first run 1776, the races were not designated 'classics' until 1815, shortly after the first running of the 1,000 Guineas.\n\nMultiple classic winners\n\n(see also Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing)\n\nIn 1902 Sceptre became the only racehorse to win four British Classic Races outright, winning both Guineas, the Oaks and the St Leger. Previously, in 1868, Formosa won the same four races but dead-heated in the 2,000 Guineas. \n\nFifteen horses have won the standard Triple Crown (2,000 Guineas – Derby – St Leger), the last being Nijinsky in 1970.\n\nIn addition to Sceptre and Formosa above, eight horses have won the fillies' Triple Crown (1,000 Guineas – Oaks – St Leger), the last being Oh So Sharp in 1985.\n\nMany horses have won two classics, some of whom have gone on to attempt the Triple Crown, losing in the last leg at Doncaster.

The Orchestra's current Principal Conductor is Vladimir Jurowski , appointed in 2007.  Andrés Orozco-Estrada became our Principal Guest Conductor in September 2015. Magnus Lindberg is the Orchestra’s current Composer in Residence.\n'The London Philharmonic Orchestra is looking the most adventurous of London’s orchestras.'\nFinancial Times, Mar 2015\nWhere we perform\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra has been performing at Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall in London since it opened in 1951, becoming Resident Orchestra there in 1992. We also have flourishing residencies in Brighton and Eastbourne , and in summer we play for Glyndebourne Festival Opera where we have been Resident Symphony Orchestra since 1964. Touring abroad forms a major part of the Orchestra's schedule: highlights of the 2016/17 season include visits to New York, Germany, Hungary, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Switzerland.\n'Exceptional playing from the London Philharmonic Orchestra.'\nThe Times, July 2015\nRecordings and film\nHaving long been embraced by the recording, broadcast and film industries, the London Philharmonic Orchestra broadcasts regularly on TV and radio. We also work with the Hollywood and UK film industries, and have been recording soundtracks for over half a century. Big headliners include The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Maurice Jarre's Lawrence of Arabia, gems like East is East and most recently Thor: The Dark World and Iron Man 3.\nIn 2005 we established our own record label , which now numbers over 90 releases. Recent releases include The Genius of Film Music: Hollywood Blockbusters 1960s to 1980s , as well as archive recordings of Tennstedt conducting Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 5 and 6 . Other projects have included a recording of James Horner's Collage: A Concerto for Four Horns – one of the very last commissions, written for members of the LPO's horn section, by the film composer just before his tragic early death in 2015.\nGet involved\n'Jurowski …  has established sufficient rapport with the orchestra to achieve the effects he desires while doing far less than most conductors do. The result was a noble and articulate reading of [Shostakovich's] great symphony, grand in scale and urgent in delivery.'\nThe Guardian, July 2015\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra runs an energetic programme of activities for young people and local communities including our FUNharmonics family concerts and the BrightSparks schools' concerts .

For example, a 15-watt LED light bulb draws 15 watts of electricity at any moment when turned on.\nWatt-hours are a measurement of energy, describing the total amount of electricity used over time. Watt-hours are a combination of how fast the electricity is used (watts) and the length of time it is used (hours). For example, a 15-watt light bulb, which draws 15 watts at any one moment, uses 15 watt-hours of electricity in the course of one hour.\nKilowatts and kilowatt-hours are useful for measuring amounts of electricity used by large appliances and by households. Kilowatt-hours are what show up on your electricity bill, describing how much electricity you have used. One kilowatt (kW) equals 1,000 watts, and one kilowatt-hour (kWh) is one hour of using electricity at a rate of 1,000 watts. New, energy-efficient refrigerators use about 300-400 kilowatt-hours per year. The typical American home uses about 7,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year [1].\nMegawatts are used to measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. One megawatt (MW) = 1,000 kilowatts = 1,000,000 watts. For example, a typical coal plant is about 600 MW in size.\nGigawatts measure the capacity of large power plants or of many plants. One gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. In 2012, the total capacity of U.S. electricity generating plants was approximately 1,100 GW [2].\nNotes and References\nWe Need Your Support\nto Make Change Happen\nWe can shift our nation away from dirty fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable sources of power—but not without you. Your generous support helps develop science-based solutions for a healthy, safe, and sustainable future.\n$25\nQuestion:\nIn what units are household electricity bills measured?\nAnswer:\nMWth\nPassage:\nGoathland\nGoathland is a village  and parish in the Scarborough district of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is in the North York Moors national park due north of Pickering, off the A169 to Whitby. It has a station on the steam-operated North Yorkshire Moors Railway line.\n\nAccording to the 2011 UK census, Goathland parish had a population of 438,  an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 407. \n\nGoathland village is 500 feet above sea level and has a history extending from Viking times. The name Goathland is probably a corruption of 'good land'. Alternatively, it may come from 'Goda's land', Goda being an Old English personal name. In 1109 King Henry I granted land to Osmund the Priest and the brethren of the hermitage of Goathland, then called Godelandia, for the soul of his mother Queen Matilda, who had died in 1083.  This is recorded in a charter held at Whitby Abbey.    The village was a spa town in the 19th century. There are many hotels and guest houses in the village, the largest, the Mallyan Spout Hotel, is named after a nearby waterfall. There is a caravan site, reached by driving along the track which is the site of the older railway route, 1835 to 1860.\n\nMuch of the surrounding land is owned by the Duchy of Lancaster. The Duchy's tenants have a common right extending for hundreds of years to graze their black faced sheep on the village green and surrounding moorland.\n\nHeartbeat connection \n\nThe village was the setting of the fictional village of Aidensfield in the Heartbeat television series set in the 1960s. Many landmarks from the series are recognisable, including the stores, garage/funeral directors, the public house and the railway station. The pub is called the Goathland Hotel, but in the series is the Aidensfield Arms. After filming for some years a replica was built in the studio. \n\nNorth Yorkshire Moors Railway \n\nGoathland railway station is on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The railway is run by a charitable trust with some paid staff but is mostly operated by volunteers, running nearly all the year including Christmas. It carries more than 250,000 passengers a year and is the second-longest preserved line in Britain. It links Grosmont in the north with Pickering in the south, along the route of the Whitby - Pickering line built by George Stephenson in 1835 and upgraded in 1865.  From 2007 some trains on the railway were timetabled to run to Whitby and in March 2014 work began in Whitby station to replace a platform and allow more North Yorkshire Moors Railway services to be timetabled Whitby - Pickering.\n\nGoathland railway station was used as the location for Hogsmeade railway station in the Harry Potter films, and the line filmed for Harry's journey.\n\nFile:Goathland-south-heather.jpg|Country just south of Goathland\nFile:Goathland moor north yorkshire.jpg|Moorland at Goathland\nFile:Goathland_Road.jpg|Goathland's main road\nFile:Goathland_Church.jpg|Goathland Church\nFile:Goathland_Railway_Station.jpg|Goathland Railway Station\nFile:Goathland_Shops.jpg|The shops on the green at Goathland, often seen in ITV's Heartbeat.\nFile:Goathland_Shops_2.jpg|More shops\nFile:Goathland_Tea_Room.jpg|Tea room\nFile:Scripps_Petrol.jpg|Scripps' Funeral Services and Petrol Station, seen on Heartbeat\n\nAppearance in literature\n\nAs well as serving as the location for the fictional village of Aidensfield, Goathland features in its own right as an important setting in Dan Chapman's 2014 dystopian, futuristic novel Closed Circuit. Forming a setting for the denouement of the novel, it is explained that the antagonist owns the entire village, and the nearby MoD site serves as a base for his operations.  Goathland also features in \"Ice\", a novel by Australian writer Louis Nowra (Allen & Unwin, 2008).\nQuestion:\nGoathland, near Whitby, is the setting for which TV show?\nAnswer:\nHeart · Beat\nPassage:\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker is a British children's book first published in 1991, written by Jacqueline Wilson and illustrated by Nick Sharratt.\n\nBackground\n\nThe book is told from the point of view of Tracy Beaker, a very naughty ten-year-old girl. The reason Tracy is often unhappy and has problems with her behaviour is because she is lonely, frustrated and feels unloved. Tracy resides in a children's residential care home (nicknamed \"The Dumping Ground\") where she has been placed as a result of neglect. Her mother often left Tracy to stay by herself when Tracy was very young and does not appear to have an interest in her daughter's life. Tracy is unhappy because she has not had any contact with her mother for a long time. She has difficulty getting along with the staff and the other children at the care home, (especially a girl named Justine Littlewood). Another reason Tracy is frustrated and angry is because she was rejected by two couples who attempted to foster her.\n\nFrom an adult's point of view, Tracy has \"behavioural problems\" and she is always telling tales. Tracy's stories seem to provide a high level of comfort and security for her. For example, a recurring story that Tracy likes to tell is that her mother is a glamorous Hollywood movie star, and that she is coming to collect her someday. Tracy says that her mother is so busy being in films that she does not have time for Tracy. Among other things, Tracy's autobiography details her life so far, her being \"deprived and abused\" in the children's home (for example, she is deprived of Mars Bars and Smarties) and the types of revenge she would like to take upon her enemies. She is very imaginative and believes that her mum will come home one day. She often portrays a deep and complicated mind.\n\nIn 2002 the book was voted the winner of the Blue Peter People's Choice Award. Wilson has written three sequels to the book, The Dare Game, Starring Tracy Beaker, and Tracy Beaker's Thumping Heart (a Red Nose Day Special).\n\nAdaptations\n\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\n\nA TV adaptation of the book was made by the BBC. There have so far been five series of the TV programme, which mainly airs on CBBC, starring Dani Harmer in the role of Tracy Beaker. Montanna Thompson plays Justine Littlewood, Tracy's worst enemy, and Nisha Nayar plays her social worker, Elaine 'the pain' Boyak. There are many characters in the TV adaptation that do not feature in the book itself. The TV adaptation has several series, and towards the end, some episodes do not feature Tracy. The TV programmes expand on the lives of the children's daily affairs, whereas the book ends with Cam fostering Tracy and her living happily ever after. In the TV programme, Tracy has disagreements with Cam and ends up back in the children's home but maintains a strong relationship with Cam. Cam gets married to Gary at the end of the series, and the last we see of Tracy is when she is talking to Justine on the steps of the children's home, after being told she will be adopted by them. Having heard this, Justine decides to give living with her dad another go.\n\nTracy Beaker Returns\n\nA new series of Tracy Beaker entitled Tracy Beaker Returns began on 8 January 2010. It had 13 episodes. A second series was also announced by the BBC. It began on 7 January 2011 and concluded on 25 March 2011. It also had 13 episodes. A third series started on 6 January 2012 and concluded on 23 March 2012. It had 13 episodes. Series 3 was the final series of Tracy Beaker Returns, as Dani Harmer left the series.\n\nThe Dumping Ground\n\nThe Dumping Ground is a spin-off to Tracy Beaker Returns, which started in January 2013. It has an extremely similar format to Tracy Beaker Returns, with the only difference being that Tracy no longer features in the series. The only character in The Dumping Ground who featured in the original novel is Mike, a care worker at the children's home, although his characterisation has changed a lot from the book – in the TV series he is shown to be an amazingly kind care worker who understands all the children, whereas in the novel not much is revealed about him, and he is only mentioned in passing a few times by Tracy. The only departed character shown in the series was Gus Carmichael (Noah Marullo) as he gets fostered by a lesbian couple\n\nTracy Beaker Gets Real\n\nIn 2006, Tracy Beaker Gets Real, a musical version of The Story of Tracy Beaker, toured up and down Britain in various theatres.\nQuestion:\nWhich children's author created Tracey Beaker?\nAnswer:\nJacqueline Aitken\nPassage:\nCreme Anglaise I Recipe - Allrecipes.com\nCreme Anglaise I Recipe - Allrecipes.com\nJenniRuff\n11/26/2008\nQuick, simple, easy version of Creme Anglaise - and a tasty one too.

They also compete in the Anglo-Welsh Cup and European Rugby Cup competitions.\n\nHistory \n\nEarly years\n\nExeter Rugby Club was founded in 1871. The club played its first match in 1873 against St. Luke's College. In 1890, they won the Devon Cup. In 1905, Exeter Rugby Club hosted the first match played by the New Zealand national rugby union team on English soil and in the Northern Hemisphere at the County Ground between New Zealand and the Devon County XV.  It was from that game, that New Zealand became known as the \"All Blacks\". \n\nWhen league rugby started, Exeter were initially placed in the Devon leagues. In the 1990s, Exeter Rugby Club turned semi-professional and changed their name from Exeter Rugby Club to Exeter Chiefs after previously being referred to as the Chiefs in the 1930s. Often their teams at the time were composed of members and former members of the British Army.  In 1993 and 1995, they reached the quarter finals of the Pilkington Cup before being knocked out by English Premiership opponents Leicester Tigers and London Wasps respectively. \n\nProfessional era\n\nIn 1997, Exeter were promoted into the Premiership Two for the first time from National League 1. They regularly finished in the top half of the table. In 2005, Exeter finished second in the league, missing out on promotion by four points behind Bristol Rugby. The next season, they moved from the County Ground to Sandy Park due to a need for modern facilities that included corporate hospitality. In 2008 they again finished in second place and again missed out on promotion by finishing behind Northampton Saints. The same situation happened the next season when Exeter finished behind Leeds Carnegie. \n\nPremiership\n\nIn 2009, National Division One was reorganized into the RFU Championship with playoffs. During the regular league season, Exeter finished second behind Bristol. In the playoffs, they defeated Bedford Blues and Nottingham R.F.C. before facing Bristol in the two legged final.  Exeter won 9–6 in the first leg at Sandy Park and then won 29–10 at Bristol's Memorial Stadium in the second leg to win promotion to the Premiership for the very first time. \n\nIn their first season in the Premiership, they finished eighth despite a two-point deduction and a £5,000 fine for fielding too many overseas players during their match against Leeds Carnegie at Headingley Stadium.  They also made their debut in the European Challenge Cup, making their way to the quarter finals where they lost to Stade Français.  In the next season, they finished fifth in the Premiership which permitted them to play in the Heineken Cup for the first time. In their first season in the Heineken Cup, they were drawn against French Clermont Auvergne, Irish Leinster Rugby and Welsh Scarlets in the group stage. They finished the group third with nine points ahead of Scarlets.  Also in 2013, they, along with Saracens, were the only rugby club to hold a minutes silence before their game against London Irish to remember the death of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher.  In 2014, Exeter Chiefs won their first major rugby trophy after they defeated Northampton Saints in the Anglo-Welsh Cup 15-8 at Sandy Park. \n\nStadium\n\nExeter play their home games at Sandy Park, which is located on the outskirts of the city. The club moved from their previous home, the County Ground, in 2006 having played there regularly since 1905.  In 2002, Exeter Chiefs started looking for a new stadium because they felt the County Ground was insufficient for growth. Despite concerns of opposition from traditionalists within the club, the motion to move was passed by 99% of the attendees at Exeter's Annual General Meeting. Sandy Park can currently accommodate 12,600 spectators, however, there are plans to increase this capacity to 20,600 with phase one having begun in early 2014.  These plans came about because of a requirement for later stages of European matches to be played at grounds with a capacity of at least 20,000. \n\nClub honours\n\n* Courage League Division 4\n** Champions 1995–96 \n* Courage League Division 3\n** Champions 1996–97 \n* The Championship\n** Champions 2009–10\n* Aviva A League\n** Champions 2011–12, 2015–16\n* Anglo-Welsh Cup\n** Champions: 2013–14\n\nCurrent squad\n\n2016-17\n\nAcademy squad\n\n \n\nCurrent kit\n\nThe kit is supplied by Samurai Rugby Gear.

As the country's chief international and domestic airport, it is definitely Southern Africa's busiest airport. It is the main airport of South African Airways as well as several other local airlines. Designated Africa's leading airport in the 2005 World Travel Awards, O.R.Tambo International Airport is a hub of convenience and comfort for travelers.\nThe airport, originally named Jan Smuts Airport, was established in 1952. Right from its beginnings, the airport gained the great privilege of receiving a De Havilland Comet jet's first commercial flight from London's Heathrow International Airport to the city of Johannesburg. In the 1970s it took part in Concorde tests as a high altitude airport. In 1994 the new South African government renamed Jan Smuts Airport to Johannesburg  International Airport and established a policy stating that airports would not be named for politicians. By 1996 Johannesburg International had taken the lead from Cairo International Airport as Africa's busiest airport. In 2004 some 15.3 million passengers passed through the airport. 27 October 2006 brought another name change to the airport. Under much criticism it was named O.R.Tambo International Airport in honor of the past ANC President.\nO.R.Tambo International Airport has 2 parallel north-south runways. The western runway is amongst the longest in the world, measuring 4,400m. The airports 6 terminals are divided into the domestic terminal, the transit terminal and the international terminal. In 2003 the domestic terminal was upgraded and reopened offering travelers greater facilities. The terminal is focused around the convenience of all its travelers with necessary amenities, easy movement and quick drop-off/pick-up zones. O.R.Tambo Airport's updated facilities include a wide variety of restaurants and shops as well as ATM's and other banking services. The airport also has an outstanding medical clinic with doctors, physiotherapists, optometrists and a dentist. Business men and women can take advantage of the great Internet connections including wireless. The relatively new parkade offers more than 5,000 parking bays. There is plenty of transport to and from O.R.Tambo International Airport including taxis, shuttles and buses. It is projected that by 2015 the airport will be handling some 24 million passengers every year.\nTags:\nQuestion:\nWhich African city is served by O R Tambo airport?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nThe Krays (film)\nThe Krays is a 1990 British drama film based on the lives and crimes of the English gangster twins Ronald and Reginald Kray, often referred to as The Krays.

It would be nearly impossible to not know someone who has been affected by conditions such as ADD, Alzheimer's, anxiety, autism, brain fog, depression, or fatigue. In part one of this series on natural mental health I gave my favorite tips for a healthy and happy brain and in part two I went over the things you would want to avoid.\nIn the mainstream medical system, if someone is struggling with one of these issues, he's typically left to pick between pharmaceutical A or B. For many, medications like antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications provide only temporary or marginal relief from their suffering. For others, they live in a constant state of medicated numbness. If medications don't provide sustainable solutions for you, or if you feel like they are not addressing the root cause of why you feel the way you do, this article is for you. In this article I want to share with you the underlying commonality between most of the people I see suffering with these mental health concerns: Inflammation.\nWe hear the term \"inflammation\" a lot when dealing with chronic health conditions. What is inflammation exactly, and how can it cause problems with your brain? Inflammation is normally a healthy response. For example, when you hurt your knee, acute inflammation enables your body to repair itself. Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is inflammation with no end in sight. Like a fire that's fueled with endless gasoline, chronic inflammation doesn't heal — it destroys. Chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation has been directly implicated in just about every chronic disease; brain conditions are no exception. Unlike other organs, your brain has no pain fibers. Chronic inflammation of the brain can manifest as problems like brain fog, depression or fatigue.\nA growing field of study referred to as the cytokine model of cognitive function , attempts to explain how inflammation affects how your brain works. Cytokines are proteins that regulate your bodies immune response. Wherever there's inflammation there are pro-inflammatory cytokines. There are many different ways in which your brain can become inflamed, both directly and indirectly. One of the main inflammatory mechanisms I come across doesn't even necessarily have to start directly in your brain, but actually can originate in your \"second brain:\" your gut.\nJust like your brain, the inner mucosal lining of your gut has no pain fibers. 95% of your body's serotonin, your \"feel-good\" hormone, is made in your intestines and it has many of the same neurological features as your brain. I've written in a previous MindBodyGreen article about how your gut-brain axis can cause weight loss resistance; it's also at the center of the cytokine model of mental health .\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnother key player is zonulin , a protein that's released during inflammatory gut conditions like leaky gut syndrome , small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, or a chronic yeast or parasite infection. One of zonulin's jobs is to open up your intestinal tight junctions , which are typically closed to protect your gut's delicate environment. Zonulin and certain bacterial endotoxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are normally isolated to your gut, can be released from your gastrointestinal system and circulate throughout your body, causing systemic inflammation . Just as zonulin opens your protective gut lining, it has also been shown to open your protective blood-brain barrier. The leaky gut has now caused a leaky brain.\nWhen your brain's protective barrier is breached it can activate the glial cells, your brain's immune cells. More than half the weight of your brain is made up of these immune cells. Once these \"immune soldier\" glial cells are activated it can turn on an inflammatory response in your brain, and they don't have an off switch. This chronic inflammation can decrease neuron firing and can be linked to just about any problem of the brain. In return, altered brain output then can also decrease its communication with your gut, impairing it's function, causing a vicious, perpetual cycle of inflammation. This inflammation can also impact your brain's communication with the endocrine (hormone) system such as the thyroid (HPT axis) and adrenal glands (HPA axis).\nIn addition to inflammatory gut conditions, we must also investigate and address any other underlying causes of brain and gut inflammation, such as:\nGluten Sensitivity\nQuestion:\nIf you were suffering from encephalitis, which of your organs would be inflamed?\nAnswer:\nYour brain\nPassage:\nPottery Marks | English Potters\nPottery Marks | English Potters\nWelcome to Pottery-English\nWelcome to Pottery-English.com\nIf, like us, you have an interest in antiques and pottery, Pottery-English is the site for you.

Don’t forget to check back in with us for new guides and reference material.\nCollecting Pottery\nSylvac cat\nPeople have admired fine china pottery for centuries, but collecting ordinary domestic pottery and local wares is a more recent interest.\nPottery by fashionable makers and designers is expensive, especially in antique shops and specialised sales, but it is still possible to build an interesting collection of modern ceramics without breaking the bank.\nStarting a pottery collection\nKeep your eyes open. You need great enthusiasm and a willingness to hunt for interesting pottery everywhere you go.Look out for antique fairs, general auctions, house clearance sales, junk shops and car boot sales – anywhere that might have china and pottery for sale. Have you looked in your own attic.\nFakes and copies\nBeatrix Potters Tailor of Gloucester by Beswick\nCopies of expensive china are common. After years of the Antiques Roadshow, there are not many genuine Ming vases just waiting to be picked up for a song, but some copies have become collectable and valuable in their own right. The recent vogue for Clarice Cliff has led to faking of pieces like the conical sugar shakers – the originals can fetch thousands of pounds at auction.\nThe cunning forgers use household dust from vacuum cleaners and tea to age their copies. Look out for normal wear, particularly on the base of household pottery – genuine wear from years of use is more difficult to fake than dust.\nPottery Marks\nPottery marks\nThe makers pottery marks can help with identification, but fakes may have convincing copies of the makers mark – though it may not be the right mark. Some fakes of Wedgwood pieces bear the marks of Dresden and Chelsea.Most makers have changed their marks over the years, so identification of genuine marks can be tricky. Happily there are plenty of books on pottery marks, which you can buy or consult in libraries.\nLearn about pottery\nTry to learn as much as you can about the makers and objects that you collect through books and sale catalogues. There may be collectors clubs that you can join to find out more and to share information with fellow enthusiasts.\nThematic collections\nCollecting objects to do with a particular subject is popular. Favourites include famous characters, pets, farm or wild animals and birds. Sporting themes, especially golf and cricket, which appeal to many collectors are priced accordingly.\nLocal potteries\nSmall potteries flourished almost everywhere in Britain. Interest in their wares is continuing to grow and they have become very popular with collectors. Nowadays the best pieces command high prices, especially in local sales.\nSmall is beautiful\nAnd often less expensive. You could choose from the many small 20th-century domestic pieces which are still widely available, especially items such as bowls, mugs, jugs, eggcups, toast-racks, ashtrays and thimbles.\nDamage\nAs with all collectables, damage and wear reduces the value. It is arguable whether even a skilful repair will add much to the value, but it may improve the appearance.\nPackaging\nIf you can find it, the original packaging may add to the interest and value of the piece.\nGood luck with the pot hunting!\nOur Site\nQuestion:\n\"Name the English pottery designer, whose \"\"Bizarre\"\" ware from the 1930's is still much sought after?\"\nAnswer:\nCLARICE CLIFF\nPassage:\nThinking man's/woman's crumpet\nIn British English, the thinking man's crumpet or  thinking woman's crumpet is a humorous term for a person who is popular with the opposite sex because of their intelligence and their physical attractiveness.[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/the-thinking-woman-s-man-s-crumpet The thinking woman's/man's crumpet - definition in the British English Dictionary & Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online]\n\nThe expression is derived from the slang use of the term \"crumpet\" to refer to a woman who is regarded as an object of sexual desire. \n\nUsage\n\nThe first person to be called \"the thinking man's crumpet\" was Joan Bakewell, by humourist Frank Muir, following her appearances in highbrow television discussion programmes such as BBC2's Late Night Line-Up.  Bakewell is still synonymous with the phrase, but it has subsequently been applied to other high-profile women such as Anne Gregg,  Joanna Lumley, Kate Bush and Felicity Kendal, and, more recently, Helen Mirren,  Jennifer Saunders, Lucy Worsley and Gillian Anderson.   Trumpeter Alison Balsom is sometimes referred to as the \"trumpet crumpet\".  In a poll in the Radio Times in 2003, Nigella Lawson received the most votes to be the readers' \"thinking man's crumpet\",  with Carol Vorderman in second place.\n\nAlmost half a century after Muir deployed the term, Bakewell (by then Baroness Bakewell and a Dame of the British Empire) remarked that \"it has taken me a lifetime to live it down. It was meant as a compliment I suppose, but it was a little bit of a put-down\". \n\nActors Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and Bill Nighy have been repeatedly called by the press \"the thinking woman's crumpet\".

{"input": "Passage:\nSwarkestone\nSwarkestone is a village and civil parish in Derbyshire, England. The population at the 2011 Census was 187. \n\nSwarkestone has a very old village church, a full cricket pitch, a plant nursery/ garden centre and restaurant called \"Swarkestone Nursery\", the Crewe and Harpur pub, a canal with locks and moorings. It was mentioned twice in Domesday as Sorchestun or Suerchestune, when it was worth twenty shillings.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. ISBN 0-14-143994-7 p.742 & 749\n\nSwarkstone Bridge\n\nThe ancient bridge at Swarkestone crosses the River Trent about 6 miles south of Derby and was for about 300 years the Midlands' main crossing of the Trent. The only crossing between Burton Upon Trent and Nottingham, it is currently Grade I Listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nHistory\n\nSwarkestone bridge was built in the 13th century to cross the river and its surrounding marshes, between the villages of Swarkstone and Stanton by Bridge.[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid\n1088337 Swarkestone Bridge and Causeway], English Heritage, retrieved 7 September 2014 It was financed by the two Bellamont sisters. Both had become engaged and were to throw a joint celebration; their fiances, however, had to meet the local barons on the far side of the river. Following a storm the Trent became swollen; eager to return to their brides-to-be and their party, the men tried to ford the river on horseback: both were swept away and drowned. The Bellamont sisters commissioned the bridge so that no one else would suffer the tragedy they had. Neither sister married and both died in poverty having exhausted their fortune on building the bridge.\n\nSwarkstone bridge is three quarters of a mile long and has 17 arches. It is the longest stone bridge in England, and the longest inland bridge in England.\n\nIn 1745, Swarkstone Bridge was the furthest point South Bonny Prince Charlie, and his troops, got in his attempt to reclaim the British Throne.\n\nAccording to Pevsner, the present part actually crossing the river, which has 5 arches, dates from the 18th century and was designed by Thomas Harrison.  Substantial work was carried out in 1795–1797 by Thomas Sykes, County Surveyor of Bridges for Derbyshire, at a cost of  £3,550.\n\nThe Bridge Today\n\nThe bridge is undersized for modern traffic and is scarcely two-lane for cars at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, the walls of the bridge often take damage from traffic.\n\nLocal Legends\n\nThe bridge is subject to several local legends. It is supposed to be haunted by the ghosts of the two Bellamont Sisters that constructed the bridge. Others have alleged the bridge is haunted by Bonny Prince Charlie's troops.\n The most commonly reported phenomenon is the sound of horses approaching at speed when there is nothing about.\n\nThe bridge is also subject to a local legend which says that the river must claim 3 lives every year in order for it to be 'pacified'. The bridge is a local accident black-spot, with 15 reported road-traffic accidents between 2008 and 2010.[http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Fatal-crash-car-road-says-expert/story-11566348-detail/story.html#axzz2On4yqTMl A CAR that caused a fatal crash on Swarkestone Bridge should not have been on the road, according to a police vehicle examiner. | This is Derbyshire]\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of the Beaker people living near Swarkestone was discovered in the 1950s. At that time it was estimated that people had lived near Swarkestone for at least 3,800 years.  The only surviving Bronze Age barrow cemetery in the Trent valley is at Swarkestone Lows near the A50. The barrow is a registered national monument. \n\nIn the Domesday Book, Swarkestone was held by the King (William the conqueror) and by Henry de Ferrers.\n\nIn the Battle of Swarkestone Bridge during the English Civil War (1643) it was defended by the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, but the outnumbered Cavaliers lost the day.\n\nIn 1745 during the Jacobite Rebellion led by Bonnie Prince Charlie, the advance party of his army reached here to gain control of the crossing of the Trent. Finding no reports of support from the south, they turned back to Derby; the invading army then retreated to Scotland and final defeat at the Battle of Culloden. Swarkestone thereby being the most southerly point reached during that army's advance on London.\n\nSport\n\nSwarkestone cricket club has gained quite a reputation in recent years. After gaining promotion to the Derbyshire Premier Cricket League in 2011, they finished 2nd in the subsequent year and won the Premier League in the 2013 season, thus becoming the top league team in Derbyshire.\n\nThe Pavilion\n\nNearby is the Jacobean grandstand called Swarkestone Hall Pavilion and walled area, formerly connected with Harpur Hall, where (it is believed, see Pevsner, loc. cit.), they used to bait bulls. The pavilion is attributed to John Smythson who also designed Bolsover Castle, and is Grade I Listed.  It was repaired and is now owned by the Landmark Trust who maintain it and rent it out to holidaymakers.\n\nImages\n\nimage:SwalkestoneLockRH.jpg|Swarkestone Lock and Keeper's House\nimage:SwalkestoneChurchRH.jpg|St James' Church, Swarkestone\nimage:SwalkestoneLowesRH.JPG|Swarkestone Lowes\n\nNotable residents\n\n*Thomas Bancroft, poet, was born here in the early 17th century.Thomas Bancroft in the Dictionary of National Biography\nQuestion:\nThe advance south into England by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745 reached approximately as far as the Swarkstone Bridge on which major English River?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nHow Delta Force Works | HowStuffWorks\nHow Delta Force Works | HowStuffWorks\nHow Delta Force Works\nA Delta Force operator prepares for a HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) Exercise.\nPhoto Greg Matheison/Mai/ Time LifePictures/ Getty Images\nConsider a special operations force that's trained to the highest level in the United States military . The force is armed with cutting-edge weaponry, well-funded and answers only to one man. How can a group -- trained as professional assassins and approaching the status of mercenaries -- be reeled in if the U.S. government won't even confirm that the group exists? Does such a force make the United States safer or more vulnerable? It's questions like these that swirl around the United States' most elite tactical combat group, the Delta Force.\nDelta Force is often referred to as Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta. It's also known as the Combat Applications Group (CAG). While it often draws its ranks from the Army Special Forces (the Army Green Berets ) and shares Fort Bragg, N.C. , headquarters with them, it isn't an Army Special Forces detachment. Delta Force is a unit unto itself, composed of members from all branches of the military.\nUp Next\nThe U.S. Armed Forces Quiz\nThey're not called soldiers, but operators and are said to shun the traditional philosophies of military life. They wear civilian clothes. They work for whomever needs them -- for the Army, the FBI and the CIA . Mark Bowden, author of the book \"Blackhawk Down\" -- for which he interviewed several Delta Force members -- famously said of the operators, \"They are professional soldiers who hate the Army\" [source: Military.com ].\nIt must be said that neither the United States government nor the military officially acknowledges the existence of Delta Force. To this end, almost all of the information contained in this article is unsupported by any official reports from the United States. It's only in recent years that vague references by the government to the group's existence have been allowed to go uncensored. These references have turned up in transcripts from Congressional hearings and biographies of high-ranking military leaders.\nBut it's nearly impossible to keep a force so deadly and made up of the stuff of legends entirely under wraps. Since its inception in 1977, stories of the Delta Force's exploits and missions have leaked out, little by little, eventually forming a brief sketch of the unit. In 1993, Delta Force came under the microscope when its operators were among those who fought and died in a failed operation to remove a Somali warlord. And in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983, reports of two missions by Delta Force -- one failed and one successful -- have become common knowledge [source: SOC ].\nBut the group has been criticized for undertaking missions that are on the fringe of regular laws governing the military. This causes some to worry that Delta Force has more power and less accountability than any military organization in a free democracy should. Delta Force is funded out of secret government accounts, away from the public eye, and is believed to answer only to the president.\nBut others claim that its purpose -- maintaining the United States' role as a leading power and as the world's police force -- necessitates the lack of restrictions and accountability surrounding its activities.\nIn the next section, we'll look at how the Delta Force is structured.\n1\nQuestion:\nActive since 1977, Which unit is the only official US Army Counter-Terrorism force?\nAnswer:\nFunny Platoon\nPassage:\nAnchovy\nAn anchovy is a small, common salt-water forage fish of the family Engraulidae.\n\nThe 144 species are placed in 17 genera; they are found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, and in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Anchovies are usually classified as oily fish. \n\nGenera\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAnchovies are small, green fish with blue reflections due to a silver-colored longitudinal stripe that runs from the base of the caudal fin.  They range from 2 to in adult length, and their body shapes are variable with more slender fish in northern populations.\n\nThe snout is blunt with tiny, sharp teeth in both jaws.  The snout contains a unique rostral organ, believed to be sensory in nature, although its exact function is unknown. The mouth is larger than that of herrings and silversides, two fish which anchovies closely resemble in other respects. The anchovy eats plankton and recently hatched fish.\n\nDistribution\n\nAnchovies are found in scattered areas throughout the world's oceans, but are concentrated in temperate waters, and are rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas. They are generally very accepting of a wide range of temperatures and salinity. Large schools can be found in shallow, brackish areas with muddy bottoms, as in estuaries and bays. They are abundant in the Mediterranean, particularly in the Alboran Sea,  Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. The species is regularly caught along the coasts of Crete, Greece, Sicily, Italy, France, Turkey, and Spain. They are also found on the coast of northern Africa. The range of the species also extends along the Atlantic coast of Europe to the south of Norway. Spawning occurs between October and March, but not in water colder than 12 °C (54 °F). The anchovy appears to spawn at least 100 km from the shore, near the surface of the water.\n\nEcology\n\nThe anchovy is a significant food source for almost every predatory fish in its environment, including the California halibut, rock fish, yellowtail, shark, chinook, and coho salmon.  It is also extremely important to marine mammals and birds; for example, breeding success of California brown pelicans  and elegant terns is strongly connected to anchovy abundance.\n\nFeeding behavior\n\nAnchovies, like most clupeoids (herrings, sardines and anchovies), are filter-feeders that open their mouths as they swim. As water passes through the mouth and out the gills, food particles are sieved by gill rakers and transferred into the esophagus. \n\nCommercial species\n\n* Type species\n\nFisheries\n\nBlack Sea\n\nOn average, the Turkish commercial fishing fleet catches around 300,000 tons per year, mainly in winter. The largest catch is in November and December. \n\nPeru\n\nThe Peruvian anchovy fishery is one of the largest in the world, however, it collapsed catastrophically in 1973 due to the combined effects of overfishing and El Niño. \n\nAs food\n\nA traditional method of processing and preserving anchovies is to gut and salt them in brine, allow them to mature, and then pack them in oil or salt. This results in a characteristic strong flavor and the flesh turns deep grey. Pickled in vinegar, as with Spanish boquerones, anchovies are milder and the flesh retains a white color. In Roman times, anchovies were the base for the fermented fish sauce garum. Garum had a sufficiently long shelf life for long-distance commerce, and was produced in industrial quantities. Anchovies were also eaten raw as an aphrodisiac.  Today, they are used in small quantities to flavor many dishes. Because of the strong flavor, they are also an ingredient in several sauces and condiments, including Worcestershire sauce, Caesar salad dressing, remoulade, Gentleman's Relish, many fish sauces, and in some versions of Café de Paris butter.  For domestic use, anchovy fillets are packed in oil or salt in small tins or jars, sometimes rolled around capers. Anchovy paste is also available. Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish, such as tuna and sea bass.\n\nThe strong taste people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process. Fresh anchovies, known in Italy as alici, have a much milder flavor.  In Sweden and Finland, the name anchovies is related strongly to a traditional seasoning, hence the product \"anchovies\" is normally made of sprats  and herring can be sold as \"anchovy-spiced\". Fish from the Engraulidae family are instead known as sardell in Sweden and sardelli in Finland, leading to confusion when translating recipes.\nQuestion:\nWhat small green fish with blue reflections (due to a silver longitudinal stripe that runs from the base of the caudal fin) is found in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans?\nAnswer:\nAnchovy\nPassage:\nBBC Bitesize - KS3 Physics - Energy in the home - Revision 1\nBBC Bitesize - KS3 Physics - Energy in the home - Revision 1\nEnergy\nEnergy in the home\nEnergy is measured in J and kJ.

Passy studied law and practised for a short time before accepting a position as an accountant in the State Council (Conseil de Droit) from 1846 to 1849. However, under his uncle's influence he gave up this post and returned to the university to study economics. True to his republican principles, he withdrew from politics after the coup d'état of Louis Napoleon and refused to be reconciled to the Second Empire; he was therefore ineligible for any government post. He became a professional economist in 1857, and in 1860 he began to teach political economy both in Paris and in the provinces.\n\nHis reputation was established through his Mélanges économiques (1857) essays and a lecture series given at the University of Montpellier and published as the Leçons d'économie politique. He was an advocate of free trade and adherent to the ideas of Richard Cobden. In 1877 he became a member of the French Académie des sciences morales et politiques, a component of the Institut de France; and he was a commander of the Legion of Honor. He was president of the Society of Political Economy for 70 years.\n\nPassy directly engaged in political questions, advocating educational reform and intervening to prevent war between France and Prussia during the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867.  In 1868, he helped found the Ligue internationale et permanente de la paix (International and Permanent League of Peace) to avert possible future conflicts and became its permanent secretary. When the organization dissolved during the Franco-Prussian War, Passy helped restructure it as the Société française des amis de la paix, which in 1889 became the Société d'arbitrage entre les Nations.\n\nIn 1881, he won election to the Chamber of Deputies, where he advocated foreign policy changes and labor reform, including legislation on industrial accidents. He won reelection in 1886 but lost in 1889. He also supported a system of international conflict arbitration, which was inspired by Randal Cremer's resolution that established arbitration between the United States and England. In 1888, his efforts led to a meeting between British Parliamentary members and French deputies to discuss the concept of organized arbitration. The following year, the Inter-Parliamentary Union was established with Passy as one of its presidents. He was a member of the International Bureau of Peace at Bern, Switzerland.\n\nPassy's writings and speeches advocating peace were widely recognized. In 1909, he published Pour la paix, a work which chronicled the establishment of the various peace and arbitration organizations with which he was associated.  From 1881 to 1902, he was professor of political economy in several colleges.\n\nHe died on June 12, 1912.  A short obituary was published in The New York Times the next day.\n\nHe was father to Paul Passy, a prominent linguist, founder of the International Phonetic Association (1886).\n\nWorks\n\n*Mélanges économiques (1857)\n*De la Propriété Intellectuelle (1859)\n*De l'Enseignement obligatoire (1859)\n*Leçons d'économie politique (1860–61)\n*La Démocratie et l'Instruction (1864)\n*La Guerre et la Paix (1867)\n*L'Histoire du Travail (1873)\n*Malthus et sa Doctrine (1868)\n*La Solidarité du Travail et du Capital (1875)\n*L'Histoire et les sciences morales et politiques (1879)\n*Le Petit Poucet du 19ième Siècle: George Stephenson (1881)\n*Historique du mouvement de la paix (1905)\nQuestion:\nWho shared the 1901 Nobel Peace Prize (the first) with Frederic Passy, for his work which inspired the creation of the Red Cross and the Geneva Convention?\nAnswer:\nJean Dunant\n", "answers": ["Trent", "Trent (disambiguation)", "TRENT"], "length": 3121, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "10b46ba322d1d3087af3ac259c78251ce11034c65818348d"}

Except for those that fall at the same time as UK public holidays, none of these holidays are bank holidays. There is, however, much support for the recognition of St David's Day as a bank holiday in Wales, in the same way as St Patrick's Day in Northern Ireland, and St Andrew's Day in Scotland.\n\nMany of the seasoned festivals originate in the Celtic culture of Wales, as does the manner of their celebration.\n\nHistoric Practice\n\nAs recorded in the Laws of Hywel Dda, the three main holidays (gwyliau) of the medieval Welsh kingdoms were Christmas (Nadolig), Easter (Pasg), and Whitsuntide (Sulgwyn). \n\nOther important holidays were the feasts of St Patrick (Gwyl Badric) on 17 March; St. Quiricus (Gwyl Giric) on 16 June; the Beheading of John the Baptist (called in Welsh Gwyl Ieuan y Moch  St. John of the Swine  as it was the day the pigs were turned out into the woods to forage through the winter ) on 29 August; St Michael (Gwyl Fihangel) on 29 September; and the Calends of Winter (Calan Gaeaf) on 1 November, All Saints' Day (yr Holl Saint).  A special drink called the \"liquor of the Apostles\" (gwirawd yr ebestyl) was brewed for and distributed on these saints' days. \n\nSaints' Days\n\nSt. David's Day\n\nThe patron saint, of Wales is St David, .

Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.\nToday, Tiergarten Schönbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.\n\nDescription\n\nTiergarten Schönbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (福豹), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. \n\nOther zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.\n\nOn 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. \n\nFrom its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.\n\nPrivate and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.\n\nHistory\n\nThe zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Schönbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.\n\nThe central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf Bäuerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().\n\nAt the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.\n\nBombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.\n\nThe zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.\n\nPechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the \"Tyrolean farmhouse\". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.\n\nIn the media\n\nA number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. \n\nThe zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.\n\nThe 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin\n\nThe zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.\n\nThe reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.\n\nLiterature \n\n* Ash, Mitchell and Dittrich, Lothar (ed.), Menagerie des Kaisers – Zoo der Wiener, Pichler Verlag, Vienna, 2002.

If the opposition party is elected to government, the Shadow Home Secretary often becomes the new Home Secretary though this is not always the case.  The office is held by Labour MP Andy Burnham.\n\nList of Shadow Home Secretaries\nQuestion:\nWho is the Shadow Home Secretary?\nAnswer:\nAndy Burnham\nPassage:\nRoy Greenslade\nRoy Greenslade (born 31 December 1946) is Professor of Journalism at City University London  and has been a media commentator since 1992, most especially for The Guardian. He writes a daily blog on The Guardian media site and wrote a column for the London Evening Standard for ten years from 2006.  \n\nEarly life and career\n\nHe was educated at Dagenham County High School (1957–63) and, aged 17, was hired by the Barking and Dagenham Advertiser. After serving a three-year indentureship he joined the Lancashire Evening Telegraph in Blackburn as a sub-editor before spending 18 months as a sub at the Manchester office of the Daily Mail.\n\nAt The Sun and elsewhere\n\nIn 1969, he entered Fleet Street as a news sub on The Sun, which had just been acquired by Rupert Murdoch. He had a brief spell with the Daily Mirror in 1972 before returning to The Sun as deputy chief sub-editor, first with the news desk and later in the features department.\n\nHe left The Sun in 1974 to write his first book and to take a degree in politics at the University of Sussex. He worked his way through university with part-time subbing jobs at the Brighton Argus, BBC Radio Brighton, the Sunday Mirror and Reveille. After graduating in 1979, he joined the Daily Star in Manchester for six months until being seconded to the Daily Express in London. He was soon appointed features editor of the Daily Star.\n\nIn 1981 he returned to The Sun as assistant editor. He was very involved in the move from Fleet Street to Wapping. Five years later, he transferred to The Sunday Times, first running the Review Section before becoming managing editor (news). In 1990, he was appointed by Robert Maxwell as editor of the Daily Mirror.\n\nWhile editor of the Daily Mirror, Greenslade was at the centre of a controversy after he rigged a competition in the paper to make sure it was unwinnable.  He admitted his behaviour in October 2011 at a seminar at the Leveson Inquiry: ″On behalf of my proprietor Robert Maxwell I fixed a game offering a million pounds to anyone who could spot the ball and ensured that no-one won. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.″ \n\nHe departed in March 1991 and later that year was consultant editor for three months to both The Sunday Times and Today.\n\nThe Guardian and other outlets\n\nFrom 1992 until 2005 he was media commentator for The Guardian. He presented BBC Radio 4's Mediumwave (1993–95) and in 1996 was the launch presenter of Britain Talks Back on Granada Talk TV. He has continued to be a regular broadcaster on media matters.\n\nAfter leaving The Guardian, he then spent three months with The Daily Telegraph in a similar capacity before returning to The Guardian to launch a media blog and began to write a weekly media column for the Evening Standard. His column for what is now the London Evening Standard lasted for ten years until April 2016, but he remains a contributor to the newspaper.  In the context of a changing industry, Greenslade concluded his last column for the London Evening Standard with the observation: \"Whatever happens, this I know:journalism, the trade I have practised for more than 50 years, must survive. Without it, democracy itself is imperilled\".\n\nOther work\n\nHe is on the board of the academic quarterly, the British Journalism Review, and is a trustee of the media ethics charity, MediaWise. In 2003, he was appointed Professor of Journalism at City University London in succession to Hugh Stephenson.\n\nGreenslade has been credited with coining the term: \"The Hierarchy of Death\" as well as writing extensively on the subject.  \n\nHe is also the author of three books, Goodbye to the Working Class (1976), Maxwell's Fall (1992) and Press Gang: How Newspapers Make Profits from Propaganda (2003).\n\nIrish republicanism\n\nDuring the late 1980s, when he was managing news editor of The Sunday Times, he secretly wrote for An Phoblacht, a newspaper published by Sinn Féin.  His pseudonym was 'George King'. This was exposed by Nick Davies, a Guardian colleague and instigator of the journalistic investigation into phone hacking. When Greenslade reviewed Davies's book on his blog in 2008, he did not deny his writings for An Phoblacht.  Greenslade also spoke at a Sinn Féin conference in London on the 30th anniversary of the hunger strikes, and he wrote an article on the same subject for An Phoblacht. He has had a house in County Donegal for many years, and a close personal friend is Pat Doherty, who from 1988 until 2009 was vice president of Sinn Féin, and who has been publicly named as a former member of the IRA Army Council.   He also stood surety for IRA member John Downey, one of the suspects in the 1982 bombing of Hyde Park which killed four soldiers. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHe is married to Noreen Taylor, the former Daily Mirror journalist and mother of actress Natascha McElhone.\nQuestion:\nWhich national newspaper has been edited by Roy Greenslade, Colin Myler and Piers Morgan?\nAnswer:\nThe Daily Mirror\nPassage:\nBirchfield Harriers\nBirchfield Harriers is an athletics club, founded in 1877.

Her mother sent her to be raised in the French court, and in 1558 she married the French dauphin, who became King Francis II of France in 1559 but died the following year. After Francis’ death, Mary returned to Scotland to assume her designated role as the country’s monarch.\nIn 1565, she married her English cousin Lord Darnley in order to reinforce her claim of succession to the English throne after Elizabeth’s death. In 1567, Darnley was mysteriously killed in an explosion at Kirk o’ Field, and Mary’s lover, the Earl of Bothwell, was the key suspect. Although Bothwell was acquitted of the charge, his marriage to Mary in the same year enraged the nobility. Mary brought an army against the nobles, but was defeated and imprisoned at Lochleven, Scotland, and forced to abdicate in favor of her son by Darnley, James.\nIn 1568, Mary escaped from captivity and raised a substantial army but was defeated and fled to England. Queen Elizabeth initially welcomed Mary but was soon forced to put her friend under house arrest after Mary became the focus of various English Catholic and Spanish plots to overthrow Elizabeth. Nineteen years later, in 1586, a major plot to murder Elizabeth was reported, and Mary was brought to trial. She was convicted for complicity and sentenced to death.\nOn February 8, 1587, Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded for treason. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, calmly accepted his mother’s execution, and upon Queen Elizabeth’s death in 1603 he became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.\nRelated Videos\nQuestion:\nAt which castle was Mary Queen of Scots beheaded?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nUrban Dictionary: nothing but net\nUrban Dictionary: nothing but net\nnothing but net\nSaid when a 'swish' is made on the basketball court.

He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner's lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linné Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.\n\nReturning home in 1834, he entered his father’s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig's laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.\n\nIn Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas’ lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813–1891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eugène Chevreul’s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig’s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.\n\nIn 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published Précis de chimie organique (1844–1845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron’s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.\n\nHe obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an École de chimie pratique (\"School for practical chemistry\") for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Zürich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the École Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for Traité de chimie organique (4 vols., Paris, 1853–56), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.\n\nWork\n\nGerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843–1846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.\n\nGerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in chemical combination.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his birthday, after being poisoned by his own chemicals during laboratory work. He was 39 years old.\n\nNotes\nQuestion:\n\"in 1853 while working on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt made acetylsalicylic acid by mixing acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate).

The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca – also referred to as Hashemites – who ruled Mecca continuously from the 10th century until its conquest by the House of Saud in 1924. Their eponymous ancestor is Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The current dynasty was founded by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, who was appointed as Sharif and Emir of Mecca by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, then in 1916 was proclaimed King of the Arab Lands (but only recognized as King of the Hejaz) after initiating the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His sons Abdullah and Faisal assumed the thrones of Jordan and Iraq in 1921.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Hashemites  claim to trace their ancestry from Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf (died c. 497 AD), the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although the definition today mainly refers to the descendants of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah.  The early history of the Hashemites saw them in a continuous struggle against the Umayyads for control over who would be the caliph or successor to Muhammad. The Umayyads were of the same tribe as the Hashemites, but a different clan. After the overthrow of the Umayyads, the Abbasids would present themselves as representatives of the Hashemites, as they claimed descent from Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, an uncle of Muhammad. Muhammad's father had died before he was born, and his mother died while he was a child, so Muhammad was raised by his uncle Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, chief of the Hashemites. \n\nFrom the 10th century onwards, the sharif (religious leader) of Mecca and its Emir was, by traditional agreement, a Hashemite. Before World War I, Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite Dhawu-'Awn clan ruled the Hejaz on behalf of the Ottoman sultan. For some time it had been the practice of the Sublime Porte to appoint the Emir of Mecca from among a select group of candidates. In 1908, Hussein bin Ali was appointed to the Emirate of Mecca. He found himself increasingly at odds with the Young Turks in control at Istanbul, while he strove to secure his family's position as hereditary Emirs.\n\nDuring and after World War I \n\nSharif Hussein bin Ali rebelled against the rule of the Ottomans during the Arab Revolt of 1916.  Between 1917 and 1924, after the collapse of Ottoman power, Hussein bin Ali ruled an independent Hejaz, of which he proclaimed himself king, with the tacit support of the British Foreign Office. His supporters are sometimes referred to as \"Sharifians\" or the \"Sharifian party\". Hussein bin Ali's chief rival in the Arabian Peninsula, the king of the Najd (highlands), Ibn Saud, annexed the Hejaz in 1925 and established his own son, Faysal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as governor. The region was later incorporated into Saudi Arabia.\n\nHussein bin Ali had five sons:\n\n* Ali, who briefly succeeded to the throne of Hejaz before its loss to the Saud family in 1925.\n* Abdullah, became the amir of Transjordan in 1921 and king of Jordan in 1946, and whose descendants continue to rule the kingdom known ever since as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n* Faisal, briefly proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, became King of Iraq in 1921.\n* Prince Zeid bin Hussein, who moved to Jordan when his brother's grandson, King Faisal II of Iraq, was overthrown and murdered in a coup in 1958.\n* Hassan, died at a young age.\n\nFamily tree\nQuestion:\nThe Hashemite ruler Faisal 2nd was the last king of which country?\nAnswer:\nEragh\nPassage:\nBrassica oleracea\nBrassica oleracea is the species of plant that includes many common foods as cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, Brussels sprouts, collard greens, savoy, kohlrabi and kai-lan.\n\nIn its uncultivated form, it is known as wild cabbage. It is native to coastal southern and western Europe. Its high tolerance of salt and lime and its intolerance of competition from other plants typically restrict its natural occurrence to limestone sea cliffs, like the chalk cliffs on both sides of the English Channel,  and the windswept coast on the western side of the Isle of Wight.\n\nWild B. oleracea is a tall biennial plant, forming a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year, the leaves being fleshier and thicker than those of other species of Brassica, adaptations to store water and nutrients in its difficult growing environment. In its second year, the stored nutrients are used to produce a flower spike 1 to(-) tall bearing numerous yellow flowers.\n\nCultivation and uses \n\nB. oleracea has become established as an important human food crop plant, used because of its large food reserves, which are stored over the winter in its leaves. It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C.  A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables (e.g., cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower) is linked to a reduced risk of several human cancers.Verhoeven DT, Goldbohm RA, van Poppel G, Verhagen H, van den Brandt PA (1996)Epidemiological studies on brassica vegetables and cancer risk.Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev5(9):733–748. Higdon JV, Delage B, Williams DE, Dashwood RH (2007) Cruciferous vegetables and human cancer risk: Epidemiologic evidence and mechanistic basis. Pharmacol Res 55(3):224–236.\n\nAlthough it is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years, its history as a domesticated plant is not clear before Greek and Roman times, when it was a well-established garden vegetable. Theophrastus mentions three kinds of rhaphanos (ῤάφανος):  a curly-leaved, a smooth-leaved, and a wild-type.  He reports the antipathy of the cabbage and the grape vine, for the ancients believed cabbages grown near grapes would impart their flavour to the wine.  It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, collards, and kale, some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus, let alone species. The historical genus of Crucifera, meaning \"cross-bearing,\" may be the only unifying feature beyond taste.\n\nOrigins \n\nAccording to the Triangle of U theory, B. oleracea is very closely related to five other species of the genus Brassica.\n\nThe cultivars of B. oleracea are grouped by developmental form into seven major cultivar groups, of which the Acephala (\"non-heading\") group remains most like the natural Wild Cabbage in appearance:\n*Brassica oleracea Acephala Group – kale and collard greens\n*Brassica oleracea Alboglabra Group – Chinese broccoli or Kai-lan\n*Brassica oleracea Botrytis Group – cauliflower, Romanesco broccoli and broccoflower\n*Brassica oleracea Capitata Group – cabbage\n*Brassica oleracea Gemmifera Group – brussels sprouts\n*Brassica oleracea Gongylodes Group – kohlrabi\n*Brassica oleracea Italica Group – broccoli\n\nIn places such as the Channel Islands and Canary Islands where the frost is minimal and plants are thus freed from seasonality, some cultivars, known as Jersey cabbages, can grow up to three meters tall. These \"tree cabbages\" yield fresh leaves throughout the year, are perennial, and do not need to be destroyed at harvest as with a normal cabbage. Their woody stalks are sometimes dried and made into [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bâtons_d%27chour.jpg walking sticks]. \n\nHistory \n\nWith the advent of agriculture and the domestication of wild crop plants, the peoples of the Mediterranean began cultivating wild cabbage. Through artificial selection for various phenotype traits the emergence of variations of the plant with drastic differences in looks took only a few thousand years. Preference for leaves, terminal bud, lateral bud, stem and inflorescence evolved the wild cabbage into the many forms we know today. \n\nImpact of Preference  \n\n* The preference for the eating of the leaves led to the selection of plants with larger leaves being harvested and their seeds planted for the next growth. Around the 5th century BC the formation of what we now know as kale had developed. \n* Preference led to further artificial selection of kale plants with more tightly bunched leaves, or terminal bud. Somewhere around the 1st century AD emerged the phenotype variation of Brassica oleracea that we know as cabbage. \n* Phenotype selection preferences in Germany led kale down another evolutionary pathway. By selecting for fatter stems the variant plant known as kohlrabi emerged around the 1st century AD. \n* Further selection in Belgium in lateral bud led to the Brussels sprout in the 18th century.\n* European preference emerged for eating immature buds, selection for inflorescence. By the 15th century AD cauliflower had developed leading also to the emergence of broccoli in Italy about 100 years later.\n\nCultivars\nQuestion:\nWhich vegetable, of the species Brassica Oleracea, has the varieties Nevada and Canberra?\nAnswer:\nPurple cauliflower\nPassage:\nThe Blue Moon Boys\nThe Blue Moon Boys were a band formed by Elvis Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. The group members were introduced by Sun Studio owner Sam Phillips in 1954, except for D.J. Fontana, who joined the group during a Louisiana Hayride tour in 1955.\n\nBackground \n\nOn July 18, 1953, Elvis Presley recorded a single in the studio as a gift for his mother's birthday, the Ink Spots' \"My Happiness\", with \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\" on the flipside. \nPresley's recording was managed by Phillips' secretary, Marion Keisker, who also kept a demo recording for the absent owner of the studio. \nKeisker called Presley for an appointment at the studio almost a year later, he returned on June 26, 1954, and although most of the session was not recorded, Phillips was impressed by Presley and introduced him to the country music band Starlight Wranglers' guitarist Scotty Moore, who later introduced Presley to bassist Bill Black.\n\nSun recordings \n\nOn July 5, 1954, the trio headed to the Sun Studios for a recording test together. They recorded the songs \"Harbor Lights\" and \"I Love You Because\", and during a break they performed an impromptu version of Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right\", which impressed Phillips, who asked for a refinement of the interpretation that later was recorded. \nPhillips played the recording for WHBQ's DJ Dewey Phillips, who played the song on his regular show next night, on July 8. \nOn July 9, the trio recorded what became the flipside to \"That's All Right\", an uptempo rockabilly version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\".   \nThe single was released on July 19, 1954,  and was a local hit in Arkansas, Mississippi and New Orleans.\n\nLive appearances \n\nScotty Moore became the manager of the band, and they toured several cities in the south, the three members still working at their regular employments when not touring.Guralnick, Peter. Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley. Little, Brown; 1994. ISBN 0-316-33225-9. Both Moore and Black focused more on the group after they let Presley perform at the regular Starlight Wrangler's show on the Bon Air club, where the reception of the audience was unfavorable, and led to animosity between them and the other members of the group for having to leave the stage.\nThe Blue Moon boys appeared on a regular basis on Eagle's Nest club in Memphis, Tennessee.  Sam Phillips booked the band an appearance at the Grand Ole Opry, which was not well received.\nAfter the failure, Phillips contacted Opry's main competition, the Louisiana Hayride. They made their first appearance on October 16, 1954. Presley sang \"That's All Right\" followed by the flipside of the record, \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\". The performance was well received and they signed a one-year contract to be official members of the Hayride, while Presley also signed a new management contract with Bob Neal. \nOn August 8, D.J. Fontana joined the band as the drummer on a regular basis after having played occasionally with them, the first time in Shreveport and subsequently on tour.\nAfter disputes with Hank Snow's manager, Tom Parker, who booked most of Presley's appearances, Bob Neal turned over the contract to Colonel Parker who became officially Presley's manager on December 15, 1955. \n\nRCA Records and later years \n\nIn January 1956 Presley signed a $40,000  contract with RCA Records,  recording for the first time on January 10, 1956, Mae Axton's \"Heartbreak Hotel\".  The Blue Moon Boys continued appearing on Presley's recordings as well as in movies like Loving You. The first live appearance of the band since Presley's army return was in 1960, during The Frank Sinatra Show's special Welcome Home Elvis. The band's last appearance was during the Elvis 1968 Comeback Special —minus Bill Black, who had died in 1965 of a brain tumor. In 2007, the Blue Moon Boys were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. \n\nSources\nQuestion:\nWhose original back up group were The Blue Moon Boys?\nAnswer:\nElvis Aron Presley\nPassage:\nBulb\nIn botany, a bulb is a short stem with fleshy leaves or leaf bases  that function as food storage organs during dormancy. (In gardening, plants with other kinds of storage organ are also called \"ornamental bulbous plants\" or just \"bulbs\".)\n\nA bulb's leaf bases, also known as scales, generally do not support leaves, but contain food reserves to enable the plant to survive adverse weather conditions. At the center of the bulb is a vegetative growing point or an unexpanded flowering shoot. The base is formed by a stem, and plant growth occurs from this basal plate. Roots emerge from the underside of the base, and new stems and leaves from the upper side. Tunicate bulbs have dry, membranous outer scales that protect the continuous lamina of fleshy scales.  Species in the genera Allium, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and Tulipa all have tunicate bulbs. Non-tunicate bulbs, such as Lilium and Fritillaria species, lack the protective tunic and have looser scales. \n\n \nOther types of storage organs (such as corms, rhizomes, and tubers) are sometimes referred to as bulbs, although as the term is used in botany, they are not. The technical term for plants that form underground storage organs, including bulbs as well as tubers and corms, is geophyte. Some epiphytic orchids (family Orchidaceae) form above-ground storage organs called pseudobulbs, that superficially resemble bulbs.\n\nNearly all plants that form true bulbs are monocotyledons, and include:\n*Amaryllis, Crinum, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, and several other members of the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae. This includes onion, garlic, and other alliums, members of the Amaryllid subfamily Allioideae.\n*Lily, tulip, and many other members of the lily family Liliaceae.\n*Two groups of Iris species, family Iridaceae: subgenus Xiphium (the \"Dutch\" irises) and subgenus Hermodactyloides (the miniature \"rock garden\" irises).\nOxalis, in the family Oxalidaceae, is the only dicotyledon genus that produces true bulbs. \n\nBulbous plant species cycle through vegetative and reproductive growth stages; the bulb grows to flowering size during the vegetative stage and the plant flowers during the reproductive stage. Certain environmental conditions are needed to trigger the transition from one stage to the next, such as the shift from a cold winter to spring. Once the flowering period is over, the plant enters a foliage period of about six weeks during which time the plant absorbs nutrients from the soil and energy from the sun for setting flowers for the next year. Bulbs dug up before the foliage period is completed will not bloom the following year but then should flower normally in subsequent years.\n\nAfter the foliage period is completed, bulbs may be dug up for replanting elsewhere. Any surface moisture should be dried, then the bulbs may be stored up to about 4 months for a fall planting. Storing them much longer than that may cause the bulbs to dry out inside and become nonviable.\n\nBulbil \n\nA bulbil is a small bulb, and may also be called a bulblet, bulbet, or bulbel.\n\nSmall bulbs can develop or propagate a large bulb. If one or several moderate-sized bulbs form to replace the original bulb, they are called renewal bulbs. Increase bulbs are small bulbs that develop either on each of the leaves inside a bulb, or else on the end of small underground stems connected to the original bulb.\n\nSome lilies, such as the tiger lily Lilium lancifolium, form small bulbs, called bulbils, in their leaf axils. Several members of the onion family, Alliaceae, including Allium sativum (garlic), form bulbils in their flower heads, sometimes as the flowers fade, or even instead of the flowers. The so-called tree onion (Allium × proliferum) forms small onions which are large enough for pickling.\n\nSome ferns, such as Hen and Chicken Fern produce new plants at the tips of the fronds' pinnae, which are sometimes referred to as bulbils.\n\nImage:Lilium lancifolium bulbils.jpg|Bulbils form in the leaf axils of Lilium lancifolium\nImage:Alliumvineale1web.jpg|Wild garlic (Allium vineale) bulbils sprouting\nImage:Allium fistulosum bulbifera0.jpg|\"Tree onions\" form clusters of small bulbs instead of flowers\nQuestion:\nWhich autumn-flowering bulbous plant is sometimes known as ‘the belladonna lily’?\nAnswer:\nMarch lilly\nPassage:\nNational Trails\nNational Trails are long distance footpaths and bridleways in England and Wales.

{"input": "Passage:\nHow the Kinks' Beloved 'Village Green Preservation Society ...\nHow the Kinks' Beloved 'Village Green Preservation Society' Completely Flopped\nSubscribe to Ultimate Classic Rock on\nThe Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society was both ahead of and behind the times when it arrived in November 1968. A critical success, but commercial disappointment at the time, the LP eventually became the Kinks’ bestselling studio album – prompting frontman Ray Davies  to once refer to it as “the most successful flop of all time.”\nDavies got the idea for a concept record about small-town life when the Kinks recorded the song “Village Green” in 1967 during the sessions for Something Else by the Kinks. The rural snapshots seemed to capture his imagination. He wrote insightful and engaging songs about memories, nostalgia, eccentric village characters and acceptance, or rejection, of the changing times. The result was the audio equivalent to the scrapbook Davies sings about in “Picture Book.”\nThe sounds of the Village Green album matched its subject matter: folksy and baroque, with an emphasis on acoustic strumming and symphonic arrangements. Most of the orchestral sounds heard on the LP were courtesy of legendary session man Nicky Hopkins playing the Mellotron. Although the Kinks’ “pinky in the air” approach was an extension of recent hits like “Autumn Almanac” and “Days” (the latter was actually recorded during the Village Green sessions), when all of these songs were placed together, the album suggested a band that was out of step with the late ’60s. Even reviewers who heaped praised on Village Green Preservation Society couldn’t help but shake their heads at a group that was looking backward while war protesters were obsessed with the present and hippies were dreaming of a future.\nBut is this why Village Green Preservation Society failed to connect with rock fans at first? Didn’t the back-to-basic approach of the Band and Paul McCartney ’s dance hall obsessions sound just as antiquated in 1968? Maybe the album’s initial failure also can be blamed on the lack of a strong single. “Starstruck” was the only one released from the LP. One can’t help think that the title track or “Picture Book” would have been a better choice.\nRegardless, the album (which Davies wanted to turn into a double LP, but settled on a 15-track single record) marked the end of an era for the Kinks. It became their first LP to not chart in the U.K. and appeared to slam the door on any future commercial ambitions in their home country. Things were not as dire in the U.S., where the album came out in January 1969, even though it remains the only original Kinks album to fail to graze the U.S. charts. Village Green also was the last time the founding Kinks members would record together, after bassist Pete Quaife left the band in early 1969.\nBut Village Green Preservation Society would live on in many ways. Davies, pleased with the results if not the public’s reaction, would continue his efforts with two more Preservation albums, and he considers them a trilogy.

In addition, there were 8,000 cigars and 1,500 bottles of wine.\nThe 1898 novel Futility by Morgan Robertson seemed to foreshadow the Titanic disaster. The work describes the demise of the Titan, an 800-foot passenger liner that strikes an iceberg on its starboard side in April and sinks with great loss of life due to insufficient lifeboats.\nSeveral years before becoming captain of the Titanic, Edward J. Smith stated: I cannot imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder.Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\nThe radio call sign of the Titanic was MGY.\nThe liner featured new davits that could accommodate at least 48 lifeboats. However, for both financial and aesthetic reasons, White Star decided to carry only 20, which was still 4 more than was required by the British Board of Trade.\nThe Titanic had three types of lifeboats. Fourteen were standard boats, capable of holding approximately 65 people each. Two were emergency cutters, which could carry 40 people. They were designed for quick lowering for such events as a person overboard. There were also four collapsible boats, which had canvas sides and could be folded for easy storage. These lifeboats had a capacity of 47 each.\nAs the Titanic sank, wireless operator Jack Phillips initially sent out a CQD, which was still used even though SOS had become the official distress signal several years earlier. However, after his assistant, Harold Bride, joked that he might not have a chance to use SOS again, Phillips began sending out both distress signals.\nIn CQD, the CQ signifies a general call, and the D represents distress. Contrary to popular belief, SOS does not mean save our ship. The letter combination was selected because of the distinct sound it makes in Morse Code.\nThe Titanic employed a bugler who would play The Roast Beef of Old England to alert passengers when meals were being served.\nA number of passengers brought dogs on the Titanic. During the sinking, the kennels were reportedly opened. Although accounts differ, it is likely that only two dogs were rescued.\nThe ship's maiden voyage was initially scheduled for March 20, 1912. However, after the Olympic collided with the Hawke, work on the Titanic temporarily halted so that its sister ship could be repaired.\nBoth the Carpathia and the Californian were sunk by German U-boats during World War I. The Britannic, which was still being constructed when its sister ship Titanic sank, foundered after reportedly striking a German mine.\nCrew members Violet Jessop and John Priest survived the sinkings of both the Titanic and the Britannic. In addition, they were also onboard the Olympic when it collided with the Hawke.\nAfter the Titanic sank, a number of people talked of raising the wreck. Among the ideas proposed was filling the hull with Ping-Pong balls.\nIn the wake of the disaster, White Star contracted several boatsnotably the Mackay-Bennettfor the grim job of retrieving bodies. Badly deteriorated corpses were buried at sea, while the others were brought to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and placed in a curling rink until being claimed.\nAmong the bodies recovered was John Jacob Astor's. He was assigned number 124 by the Mackay-Bennett, and his effects included a gold watch, a diamond ring, a gold pencil, and $2,240 in bank notes.\nAfter the collision, Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall determined the Titanic's position as 41°46¢ N 50°14¢ W. In accordance with his wishes, Boxhall's ashes were spread at that location following his death in 1967. When the wreck was found in 1985, it was some 13 nautical miles (24 km) away.\nCharles Lightoller, the Titanic's second officer, remained with White Star until it became apparent that he would never be given command of a ship. During World War II he sailed a yacht to Dunkirk, France, to help with the evacuation of Allied troops and rescued some 130 men.\nAfter the Olympic's collision in 1911, some claimed that White Star had switched the Titanic and Olympic and it was actually the Olympic that sank in 1912. This conspiracy theory, however, was largely discredited, especially after the discovery in the wreckage of a propeller and other items that bore the Titanic's yard number, 401; the Olympic's was 400.\nQuestion:\nThe Titanic had three anchors.  What was their combined weight (in tons)?\nAnswer:\n31 tons\nPassage:\nChrometophobia - money fear, money phobia, fear of money ...\nChrometophobia - money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia\nWebsites\nWelcome to my site for Chrometophobia.

Please use the other links in the navigation bar to find information on Chrometophobia.\nWhat is phobia?\nA phobia is a strong, persistent fear of situations, objects, activities, or persons. The main symptom of this disorder is the excessive, unreasonable desire to avoid the feared subject. Phobias are believed to be developed by heredity, genetics and brain-chemistry combine with life-experiences.\nTypes of phobias: Social phobias, Specific phobias and Agoraphobia\nSocial phobias are fears that involve other people or social situations such as performance anxiety, fears of embarrassment or humiliation by scrutiny of others. Examples of these phobias would be eating in public, giving a speech, and even sexual activities. People with these phobias tend to  avoid the situations they fear.\nSpecific phobias are typically fears of certain objects or situations. Specific phobias usually contain specific panic triggers, such as spiders, snakes, mice, elevators, or flying. These fears develop during childhood and tend to go away, for example, the fear of the dark. If the fear continues through to adulthood, treatment would be the only solution. These fears can keep people from having a normal life, depending on how often they must encounter/avoid the fear.\nAgoraphobia is a fear of experiencing a panic attack in a place or situation from which escape may be difficult or embarrassing or they cannot obtain help. People with this phobia may fear being alone, being in a crowd, flying, being in an elevator. Agoraphobia is the only phobia regularly treated as a medical condition.\n \nNote: If you are going to do a search, some common Chrometophobia search terms include Chrometophobia, money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia.\nDISCLAIMER: PLEASE READ - By printing, downloading, or using you this information, you agree to the following: 1) I am only providing this material for information and research purposes. 2) The information is \"AS IS\", \"WITH ALL FAULTS\". 3) You understand the information was gathered by doing a general search on Internet search engines for the following terms: Chrometophobia, money fear, money phobia, fear of money, phobia of money, Chrometophobia. 4) User assumes all risk of use, damage, or injury. 5) Information may have errors or be outdated. 6) Some information is from historical sources or represents opinions of the author. 7) You agree that we have no liability for any damages. 8) I are not liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, or special damages.

For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.\n\nWhile the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder: \n*Places his or her front foot behind or on the front bolts of the board and towards the heel-side edge of the board.\n*The skater pushes the ball of the back foot on the tail of the board slightly angled initiating the \"pop\" and a slight spin. \n*The rider's front foot is slid out diagonally in order to start the board rotating while the shoulders are centered over the board.\n*His or her feet are lifted out of the way so that their board can spin completely.\n*The rider catches their board and roll away. Skateboarders considered it good execution of the trick to stop the board's rotation with the feet in midair rather than to allow contact with the ground to stop the board.\n\nVariations\n\nVariations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:\n\n*Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.\n*Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.\n*Heelflip Body Varial,(not to be confused with the disco flip, in which a riders performs a sex change 180 while executing a Kickflip), where the skater does a backside 180 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.\n*Varial Heelflip, where the board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees frontside (frontside pop shove-it) at the same time.\n*Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.\n*Late Front-Foot Heelflip, in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.\n*Late Heelflip, in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.\n*The Heelflip Grab, a variation on grabs where the rider flips the board and catches it with his hand rather than the feet. It was first done on a vertical ramp but now is very commonly seen done on launch ramps or other surfaces which can generate sufficient air time.\n*Inward Heelflip, a combination of the backside pop shove-it and the Heelflip, this trick is usually executed with the crossing of the skater's legs. The opposite of a Hardflip.\n*Bigspin Heel, the skaters body does a frontside 180 while their board does a laser flip.\nQuestion:\nHeel flip, kick flip, and ollie are tricks in which action sport?\nAnswer:\nTAK Skateboarding\n", "answers": ["The Kinks", "John Gosling (The Kinks musician)", "Gordon John Edwards", "The Ray Davies Quartet", "Kinks", "The Kinks (band)", "Kinks, The", "THE KINKS"], "length": 3078, "dataset": "triviaqa_e", "language": "en", "all_classes": null, "_id": "43c422d9cef2d1e15c3e13aa540c027512d990abdb28615c"}

This pretty basin was once a thriving transport hub. Now, traditional narrowboats and elegant black and white iron footbridges sit side-by-side with modern bars and restaurants. Close by is luxury shopping centre the Mailbox, with its stylish clothing shops and cafes. \nAmong the cargos that once travelled on the canal was chocolate crumb to the Cadbury factory. Today, this is Cadbury World, a great day out if you have a sweet tooth.\nChocolate and guillotines\nAt Kings Norton Junction, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal joins under permanently open guillotine gates. Opposite the junction is an attractive toll house with its board showing the charges.\nThe Lickey Hills are pierced by three long tunnels. The canal was realigned to allow the building of the M42. Tardebigge Wharf, with its dry dock, maintenance yard, workers' cottages, and historic warehouse remains the main base for maintenance on the canal, and is a great place to start a walk.  It was here that Tom Rolt met Robert Aickman, which led to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association.\nHistoric meeting\nAll 58 locks are in the second half of the canal, as the canal descends through rural Worcestershire. The Tardebigge lock flight has 30 locks in just over two miles, making it the longest in the country.\nHanbury Hall (National Trust) can easily be reached by a pleasant walk across the fields from Astwood Bottom Lock. Hanbury Junction marks the connection with the Droitwich Junction Canal, linked with the Droitwich Barge Canal and offers a route to the River Severn at Hawford. You might like to take a short walk down the Hanbury Flight, which was rebuilt by volunteers. Hanbury's other claim to fame is that it is said to be the real-life counterpart of Radio 4's Ambridge, home of The Archers.\nAround Bilford, the countryside is left behind as the canal begins to encroach on the city environs. The Commandery was the headquarters of Charles Stuart before the Battle of Worcester in 1651.\nAhead lies Diglis Basins and two wide locks accessing the Severn. Once very busy with commercial traffic, the working boats have long been replaced by pleasure craft. Worcester Cathedral stares down imposingly on travellers entering the river.\nBoating\nThe Worcester & Birmingham Canal is a justifiably popular cruising route and is now part of both the Avon and Stourport Cruising Rings. With 58 locks in all it is well suited to energetic crews, or those who don't mind taking their time.\nDownload Worcester & Birmingham Canal towpath guidance for cyclists\nThe history\nThe purpose of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal was to give a much shorter link between Birmingham and the river Severn. Against opposition from other canals, it obtained its Act in 1791. Construction started at the Birmingham end but progress was slow. The canal was intended to be broad (for boats up to 14ft wide), which is why the first three tunnels have this width, but shortage of money meant that the section from Tardebigge to Worcester was built only wide enough for narrow boats. It opened throughout in 1815.\nWater supply was a major problem and a source of conflict with connecting canals.  At first the Birmingham Canal and the W&B were physically separated by what was known as Worcester Bar, but in 1815 they agreed a compromise whereby the two canals would be linked by a lock, with the W&B paying a compensation toll for all traffic passing through.\nThe guillotine lock by Kings Norton Junction on the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal enabled each canal to preserve its water, regardless of the respective levels.\nExperimental vertical boat lift\nTardebigge top lock is particularly deep because it was the site of a experimental vertical boat lift, which proved not to be robust enough.  After a few months it was replaced by a conventional lock — but as a canal’s water usage is largely determined by its deepest lock, it would have been better if it had been replaced by two locks. \nThe volume of traffic never lived up to expectations, though it improved once the Gloucester & Berkeley Canal opened in 1827. Salt had been found when the canal was being cut at Stoke Prior, and the industry which developed became an important source of traffic.  Worcester gas works and other canalside industries used coal brought by the canal.\nRailway competition\nHowever, from 1841 railway competition took away much of the business and in 1868 losses were so severe that a receiver was appointed. The canal was saved by being bought in 1874 by the Sharpness New Docks Company (which by then owned the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal). Under enterprising management new traffic was sought, and the canal survived until nationalisation in 1948.\nThe last commercial traffics were coal from Cannock to Worcester and chocolate crumb from Worcester to Bourneville, ceasing in 1960 and 1961 respectively.\nQuestion:\nThe English cities of Gloucester and Worcester are on which river?\nAnswer:\n", "context": "Passage:\nCaryn\nCaryn is a given name.

The song is also referred to by the title \"Oh, My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\", \"My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose\" or \"Red, Red Rose\" and is often published as a poem.\n\nThe poem\n\nO my Luve's like a red, red rose\nThat’s newly sprung in June;\nO my Luve's like the melodie\nThat’s sweetly play'd in tune.\n\nAs fair art thou, my bonnie lass,\nSo deep in luve am I:\nAnd I will luve thee still, my dear,\nTill a’ the seas gang dry:\n\nTill a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,\nAnd the rocks melt wi’ the sun:\nI will luve thee still, my dear,\nWhile the sands o’ life shall run.\n\nAnd fare thee weel, my only Luve\nAnd fare thee weel, a while!\nAnd I will come again, my Luve,\nTho’ it were ten thousand mile.\n\nOrigins of the song\n\nBurns worked for the final ten years of his life on projects to preserve traditional Scottish songs for the future. In all, Burns had a hand in preserving over 300 songs for posterity, the most famous being \"Auld Lang Syne\". He worked on this project for James Johnson's the Scots Musical Museum (1787-1803) and for George Thomson's five-volume A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice. \nBurns had intended the work to be published as part of Thomson's selection. However, he wrote to a friend that Thomson and he disagreed on the merits of that type of song. \"What to me appears to be the simple and the wild, to him, and I suspect to you likewise, will be looked on as the ludicrous and the absurd.\"\n\nInstead, Burns gave the song to Scots singer Pietro Urbani who published it in his Scots Songs. In his book, Urbani claimed the words of The Red Red Rose were obligingly given to him by a celebrated Scots poet, who was so struck by them when sung by a country girl that he wrote them down and, not being pleased with the air, begged the author to set them to music in the style of a Scots tune, which he has done accordingly. In other correspondence, Burns referred to it as a \"simple old Scots song which I had picked up in the country.\"\n\nThe lyrics of the song are simple but effective. \"My luve's like a red, red rose/That's newly sprung in June\" describe a love that is both fresh and long lasting. David Daiches in his work describes Burns as \"the greatest songwriter Britain has produced\" for his work in refurbishing and improving traditional Scots songs including \"Red, Red Rose\" which he described as a \"combination of tenderness and swagger.\"\n\nMusical performances\n\nUrbani published the song to an original tune that he wrote. The song appeared in Johnson's Museum in 1797 to the tune of Niel Gow's \"Major Graham\" which was the tune that Burns wanted. In 1799, it appeared in Thomson's Scottish Airs set to William Marshall's Wishaw's Favourite  with the lyric \"And fare thee weel awhile\" changed.\n\nThe song became more popular when Robert Archibald Smith paired it with the tune of \"Low Down in the Broom\" in his Scottish Minstrel book in 1821. This has become the most popular arrangement. The song has been widely performed by a range of artists in the 20th and 21st centuries including Jean Redpath, Pat Boone, Kenneth McKellar, the Fureys, Eddi Reader, Camera Obscura, Eva Cassidy, Izzy, and Ronnie Browne of the Corries (in his solo album after Roy Williamson's death, 'Scottish Love Songs'(1995)).\n\nRobert Schumann composed a setting of a German translation of Burns's poem in 1840.\n\nSinger and actor Pat Boone performed the song on piano in the 1959 film adaptation of A Journey to the Center of the Earth.\n\nFour modern choral arrangements include a four-part, a cappella version by David Dickau, an intimate, Irish folk music-influenced setting, also SATB a cappella, by Matthew Brown (\"A Red, Red Rose,\" published by Santa Barbara Music), an accompanied SATB setting by James Mulholland as well as a broader version by American composer René Clausen.  Clausen's arrangement incorporates a piano, two violins, and a four-part chorus. (SATB) A Swedish translation and recording named \"Min älskling (du är som en ros)\" was made famous by the renowned Swedish musician Evert Taube.\n\nCarly Simon sang a solo version of \"A Red, Red Rose\" on the album The Simon Sisters Sing The Lobster Quadrille And Other Songs For Children that she produced with her sister Lucy Simon.\nA version of Oh My Love is like a Red, Red Rose by Italian singer Ariella Uliano was performed with classical guitar accompaniment on the album Leave Only Your Footsteps Behind.\n\nThe lyrics are included in the song \"Final Breath\" by the post rock band Pelican on their album What We All Come to Need.\n\nMoscow-based indie rock band \"Red Red Rose\" derives its name from the poem and has a song called \"RRR\" inspired by the poem.\n\nInspiration\n\nWhen asked for the source of his greatest creative inspiration, American singer songwriter Bob Dylan selected Burns' 1794 song A Red, Red Rose, as the lyrics that have had the biggest effect on his life.  \n\nSymbolism \n\nThe song is highly evocative, including lines describing rocks melting with the sun, and the seas running dry. Burns may have been inspired by the concept of deep time put forward a few years earlier by geologist James Hutton in his Theory of the Earth in 1789\n \n.  Hutton and Burns were contemporaries, and would have mixed in similar circles in Edinburgh.\nQuestion:\nWhich poet’s love is like a red, red, rose that’s newly sprung in June?\nAnswer:\nRabbie Burns\nPassage:\nPule cheese\nPule cheese, or just pule, is a cheese made from the milk of Balkan donkeys from Serbia.\n\nA distinctive dairy product of Serbian cuisine, pule is reportedly the \"world's most expensive cheese\", fetching 1,000 Euros per kilogram. In September 2013, the cheese was valued by a news source at $600 USD per pound. It is so expensive because of its rarity: there are only about 100 jennies in the landrace of Balkan donkeys that are milked for pule-making, each jenny must be hand-milked thrice daily, it takes 25 litres (6.6 gallons) of milk to create one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cheese, and the cheese is then smoked.\nQuestion:\nPule cheese, said to be the world's most expensive was in the news in Dec 2012 when Novak Djokovic bought the world's supply for his restaurant chain.

It is the only Level 42 song to be a top 10 hit in the United States, where it reached #7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and it is their second top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, reaching #6 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\"Something About You\" appears in many Level 42 collections: Level Best, The Very Best of Level 42, and The Definitive Collection.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video of \"Something About You\" is directed by Stuart Orme, who also directed videos for the Level 42 songs \"Lessons in Love\" and \"Running in the Family\", as well as Phil Collins and Genesis. The music video appears in their video album Family of Five, released in 1987.\n\nMark King appears as a dark clown magician, representing the negative aspects in the relationships of Mike Lindup, Phil and Boon Gould with their girlfriends, all played by actress Cherie Lunghi. \n\nCover versions\n\n* In 1993, Paul Shaffer and the Party Boys of Rock 'n' Roll recorded an instrumental version for their album The World's Most Dangerous Party.\n* In 2006, Anthony David recorded a cover of the song for his album The Red Clay Chronicles.\n* In 2008, American R&B duo Zo! and Tigallo (Phonte, formerly of Little Brother) recorded a cover for their EP entitled Zo! & Tigallo Love the 80's.\n* In 2010, Cary Brothers included a cover of the song on his album Under Control.\n* In 2011, guitarist Craig Sharmat covered the song on his album Outside In, released on Innervision records in February of that year.\n* In 2012, the Virgo Vertigo (aka - Tory World) covered the song for a video journal on YouTube.\n\nSampling\n\nJapanese rapper Zeebra sampled Something About You in his song \"Touch The Sky\".\n\nAppearances in other media\n\nThe song was featured on the soundtrack of the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV on the fictional in-game station \"Vice City FM\".\n\nChart performance\n\nWeekly singles charts\n\nYear-end charts\nQuestion:\nSomething About You and Lessons In Love were top ten hits for which group\nAnswer:\nLevel 42\nPassage:\nMidori (liqueur)\nMidori is a sweet, bright-green-coloured, muskmelon-flavored liqueur made by Suntory. It is manufactured in Japan, USA, Mexico, and France, although it was made exclusively in Japan until 1987. Midori is usually 20–21% alcohol by volume. Its name is the Japanese word for \"green\". French-made Midori is sweeter than the original Japanese version.\n\nAs it is extremely sweet, Midori is not usually taken \"straight\"; it is generally used in a mixed drink (i.e., a cocktail), such as a Japanese slipper. It is usually used in a range of long drinks – with lemonade, fresh lemon juice, lime juice, pineapple juice, or orange juice.

Is this true? What's the tale?\nIf only it were that simple. The true story is that the queen of hearts was once wed to the king of hearts, until he caught her giving the jack of diamonds a royal flush, whereupon he yanked the jack off, grabbed the nearby ace of spades, and clubbed them both to death.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nBut seriously. Playing cards are cultural artifacts tracing back at least a millennium, beginning in China before A.D. 1000. By the 13th century, they had reached the Middle East; the oldest known deck, from Egypt's Mamluk period, already consisted of 52 cards.\nThe Islamic suits were adapted variously in southern Europe in the late 14th century, and figures and caricatures were added. The pattern that we now consider standard -- hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds, kings, queens, and jacks -- originated in France in the mid-15th century. The French liked to use representations of specific persons on their court cards, but they varied from deck to deck, place to place, and time to time. These featured kings supposed to represent Charlemagne, Alexander the Great, Caesar, and King David, and queenly portrayals of Pallas, Greek goddess of war and wisdom, Helen of Troy, and Rachel and Judith, two Old Testament heroines. Speculation abounds about the jacks, but most experts agree that they are based on La Hire, one of Joan of Arc's comrades; Hector, a prince of Troy; Judas Maccabaeus, an ancient Jewish warrior; and Brad Pitt.\nGot a question?

It is run at Newbury over a distance of about 3 miles and 2½ furlongs (5,331 metres), and during its running there are twenty-one fences to be jumped. It is a handicap race, and it is scheduled to take place each year in late November or early December.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1957, and it was initially staged at Cheltenham. The winner of the inaugural running, Mandarin, was owned by Peggy Hennessy, a member of the family which founded Hennessy, the race's sponsoring company. It was transferred to Newbury in 1960, and it was won by Mandarin for a second time in 1961. The race's second running was won by Taxidermist, ridden by the amateur rider John Lawrence, later Lord Oaksey, who was the breeder and part-owner of the 2011 winner, Carruthers. \n\nThe race's association with Hennessy has continued throughout its history, and this now represents British racing's longest commercial sponsorship. The record was previously held by the Whitbread Gold Cup, which was first run seven months before the \"Hennessy\", and which was sponsored by Whitbread until 2001.\n\nThe Hennessy Gold Cup has been won by eight horses which have also achieved victory in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.

The southern extent of the range fall within East Dunbartonshire. The range overlooks the villages of Strathblane, Blanefield and Lennoxtown to the south; Killearn to the west; Fintry and Strathendrick to the north. The Fintry Hills lie further to the north; Kilpatrick Hills lie to the west and the Kilsyth Hills to the east.\n\nThe Earl's Seat is the highest point of the Campsie Fells, measuring 578 m (1896 ft).  On the top of the Earl's Seat is a trig point. Two main ways of climbing the Earl's Seat are by going past Dumgoyne from the Glengoyne Distillery or going up the Fin Glen from Clachan of Campsie.\n\nThe name is taken from one of the individual hills in the range, called Campsie; meaning \"crooked fairy hill\", from the Scottish Gaelic cam, meaning crooked, and sìth meaning fairy. \"Fell\" originates from the Old Norse word fjal, meaning hill.\n\nErosion along the line of a geological fault known as the Campsie Fault has left tiers of rock representing some 30 lava flows which date from the Carboniferous period. The headwaters of the River Carron rise in the Campsies.\n\nThe Campsie Fells have cemented their place in history as the birthplace of Scottish skiing, when W.W.

Months were invented and first used in Mesopotamia to measure the natural period related to the cycle of the moon.\nNames of full moons\nThe addition of January and February moved the months September , October , November , and December to later in the year so they no longer correspond with the original meaning of their names. In the Roman calendar their original names in Latin mean the “seventh”, “eighth”, “ninth”, and “tenth” month.\nIs there a perfect calendar?\nThere are many calendars that use months to divide up the year. The Islamic calendar, the Hebrew calendar, and the Hindu calendar are a few examples. Although the Gregorian calendar is the most commonly used calendar today, other calendars are still used to calculate certain holidays and annual feasts to correspond with the Gregorian calendar.\nOld Names of Months\nMonths in the ancient Roman calendar include:\nMercedonius - an occasional month after February that would be used to realign the Roman calendar. Today we use Leap Day for this alignment.\nQuintilis - renamed July in honor of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE.\nSextilis - renamed August in honor of Roman Emperor Augustus in 8 BCE.\nHow Many Have 28, 30, or 31 Days?\nThe Gregorian calendar has 4 months that are 30 days long and 7 months that are 31 days long. February is the only month that is 28 days long in common years and 29 days long in leap years.\nThe 12 Months of the Year\nThe Gregorian calendar and the Julian calendar both consist of the following twelve months:\nQuestion:\nHow many months of the year end in the letter ‘Y’?\nAnswer:\nFour\nPassage:\nBoycie\nHerman Terrance Aubrey \"Boycie\" Boyce (born 31 January 1948) is a fictional character in the popular BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses played by John Challis. His story is continued in the spin-off series The Green Green Grass, which began filming in June 2005, in which Boycie and family have fled from a gang of criminals to the countryside. A younger Boycie also appears in the prequel series Rock & Chips. With Denzil, he is one of only two characters to appear in all three.\n\nProfile\n\nBoycie is a local second-hand car dealer from Lewisham and for a long time was the richest and most successful regular at the Nag's Head pub. Boycie, although materially successful and ostentatious in his spending, remains competitive with Del and other friends, enjoying their company, although he does enjoy reveling in his superiority. Despite this, it appears that he dearly loves his friends throughout the series. He generally wears clothes and carries accessories synonymous with 1980s yuppie success, such as trench coats and very early mobile telephones. In the episode Sickness and Wealth, in which the series regulars took part in a seance, the medium asked for \"an Audrey. Audrey. No... Aubrey?\" When Boycie replied that his middle name was Aubrey, Trigger said \"You never told us your name is Aubrey.\" Boycie replied \"Nor would you if your name was Aubrey.\" Boycie's drink of choice in the Nag's Head is a large cognac.\n\nBoycie and Del share a loose friendship, but prefer to play a long-standing game of one upmanship. They play each other at poker,  in which they both cheat and the stakes are high.  Boycie is at pains to maintain the upper hand over Del in that he is a mason, a successful businessman and wealthier than the Trotters. One of the his trademarks is his deep, mocking laugh, usually following a sarcastic, biting remark at the expense of Del or other characters, as well as his distinctive South London nasal twang. Boycie has appeared since the second episode of the first series; he made sporadic appearances from series 2 - 5 and appeared more in series 6 and 7.\n\nIt is, however, usually Del (a character more street smart and popular with the Nag's Head social group) that wins the upper hand, often trading on the fact that he has a long-standing, flirtatious friendship with Boycie's wife, Marlene. Del has alluded to past sexual encounters with Marlene, and to her reputation amongst Nag's Head regulars as 'The Peckham Bicycle'. He has also claimed to have inside knowledge, through Marlene, of Boycie's marital secrets, and has alleged that Boycie has at times suffered from impotence; these rumours were not fully quashed even after the eventual birth - following many attempts - of Boycie and Marlene's son, Tyler.\n\nBoycie enjoys overt displays of wealth, formerly living in (the fictional) Kings Avenue, the most expensive street in south east London.  Kings Avenue is a parody on one of London's real richest streets, the Bishops Avenue in Hampstead. He also owns a holiday cottage in Cornwall.\n\nIn The Green Green Grass Boycie is portrayed with the same personality as in Only Fools and Horses but he seems to be more respected by the women. In one episode, \"Sex and the Country\" he is seduced by Tyler's English teacher who admits she likes more mature men, and in another episode, \"Life Swap\", Boycie's swapped wife tries to seduce him.\n\nIn two episodes, it is alluded to that Boycie has had at least two extramarital affairs. In \"Go West Young Man\", he reveals he has a 'bit on the side', whom he buys a E type Jaguar for, but Del Boy later crashes it. In \"Dates\", Del blackmails Boycie into doing a favour for him by threatening to inform Marlene of an encounter Boycie had with a woman in Sheffield.\n\nIt is revealed in the episode 'From Prussia With Love' that Boycie spent some time in prison while younger - for unspecified reasons he was convicted of perjury, embezzlement, conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the fraudulent conversion of traveler’s cheques and attempting to bribe the Mayor of Lambeth.\n\nIn Rock & Chips, Boycie is portrayed as a young man and a member of Del's gang at school. From the start, it is obvious that he is still the tight person seen in the original stories, although he is much more amiable and humorous as a young man. Later in the series, after leaving school, he gets a job as a car cleaner for Alberto Balsam, a Spanish second-hand car dealer. Although the series would end following John Sullivan's passing, it is possible that Boycie inherited the showroom from Balsam and turned it into his own business. Though Boycie is clean shaven throughout the prequel, Sullivan had reportedly intended for Boycie to grow his trademark moustache in later episodes.\n\nFirst name\n\nThroughout Only Fools and Horses and The Green Green Grass, Boycie is given many first names including Aubrey, which later is identified as his middle name, as can be heard during the seance scene in the episode \"Sickness and Wealth\". At his remarriage, after discovering he hadn't been married to Marlene for forty years because the registrar was unlicensed, the Vicar names him as Herman Aubrey Boyce. However, in \"Strangers on the Shore\", his first name is clearly seen as Terrance on the contract book towards the end of the episode.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the name of Boycie's wife in 'Only Fools and Horses?\nAnswer:\nMARLENE\nPassage:\nWhy must opposite faces of dice always add up to 7 (1/6,2 ...\nWhy must opposite faces of dice always add up to 7 (1/6,2/5,3/4)?

Would it make any difference if they didn't?\nBill Thomson, Watford, Herts\nThe design as a whole is to provide a randomly determined integer from one to six, each of those values being equally likely to militate against concerns that the faces of dice cause a small bias. For a single roll of a fair s-sided die, the probability of rolling each value is exactly 1/s-an of a discrete uniform distribution. For n multiple rolls, with a s-sided die the possibility space is equal to sn. So, for n rolls of an s-sided die the probability of any result is 1/sn. As the number of dice increases, the distribution of the sum of all numbers tends to normal distribution by the central limit theorem.\nGOTETI MVSR KRISHNA, TADEPALLIGUDEM,ANDHRAPRADESH INDIA\nIf you take the numbers 1,2....6 then add opp faces!

He is also one of Tintin 's closest friends. Haddock is highly addicted to whiskey but he also likes other spirits like rum. He first appeared in The Crab with the Golden Claws and had been in every Tintin  book since then. \nContents\n[ show ]\nHistory\nCaptain Haddock sailed over twenty years with his old friend, Captain Chester , before becoming commander of the Karaboudjan where his alcoholism was taken advantage of by his crooked first mate Allan Thompson . Tintin rescued him from the ship and the two friends were barely ever parted again. He is a direct descendant of the 17th century seafarer Sir Francis Haddock , a sea captain under Charles II. He was the captain for two expeditions during his adventures with Tintin, commanding the Aurora in The Shooting Star during the expedition to find the meteorite and the Sirius , Captain Chester's ship that he lent to Haddock to find Red Rackham's treasure. At the end of the latter adventure, Haddock acquired with the proceeds of the sale of his friend Cuthbert Calculus ' patent for the Shark-proof submarine , Marlinspike Hall , which once belonged to Captain Haddock's ancestor Francis. Haddock retired from sailing there and invited Tintin and Calculus to indefinitely live there with him.\nName\nAs for the origin of the name of Captain Haddock's name, who first appeared in Hergé 's notes in 1938 , according to Philippe Goddin , author of Chronology of a work, it is inspired by Captain Craddock, Franco-German film Hanns Schwarz and Max Vaucorbeil (1931), of which Hergé was a big fan. In the original french version of The Crab with the Golden Claws, Captain Haddock even sings a song in the film: Guys navy. However, according to the first wife of Hergé, Germaine Kiekens , the name \"Haddock\" comes from the English fish dish, the smoked haddock. However, the name Haddock is a real surname in English, examples such as Sir Richard Haddock (1629-1715) ordered the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay. His second son, Nicholas Haddock followed the career of his father. In addition, Herbert James Haddock (1861-1946) was commander of the White Star Line and the Titanic among others in the technical tests before delivery to the transatlantic company, and then the sister ship of the Titanic, the Olympic.\nDrunkness\nCaptain Haddock was a drunkard, Which is one of his weaknesses. He hates drinking anything that doesn´t contain alcohol, like water. He did make attampts to shake this habit, even becoming the president of the Society of Sober Sailors , a seafarers equivalent to Alcoholics Anonymous. However, when Professor Calculus invented the pills to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant in Tintin and the Picaros , this weakness was gone.\nNames\nCaptain Haddock has a large amount of names hne isyvocabularyells many when he wishes to insult.\nBianca's Names\nBianca Castafiore has trouble remembering Haddock's last name and has created many new names, below is a list:\nAddock, Capslock, Kapok, Bangkok, Bartok, Fatstock, Drydock, Hopscotch, Stopcock, Hammock, Paddock, Hassock, Havoc, Maggot, Bootblack, Balzac, Bedsock, Padlock, Hatbox, Stockpot, Harrock, and Hemlock.\nOne reason why Bianca Castafiore always has trouble saying Haddock's last name correctly may be because when they first met in the book The Calculus Affair, Haddock was unable to say his name correctly:\nCastafiore: Aha, you little flatterer, so you've come to congratulate me, with this... fisherman...

Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is Béchamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nBéchamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier François, published in 1651 by  François Pierre La Varenne (1615–1678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Blé, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier François ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velouté with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier's Répertoire presents one recipe as: \"White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes.\" \n\nPreparation\n\nBéchamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a soufflé base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nBéchamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Crème sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term \"white sauce\" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with béchamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman's Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\nQuestion:\nWhat is the sauce made from adding cheese to a Bechamel sauce?\nAnswer:\nMornay (disambiguation)\nPassage:\nJohn Hicks\nSir John Richard Hicks (8 April 1904 – 20 May 1989) was a British economist and one of the most important and influential economists of the twentieth century. The most familiar of his many contributions in the field of economics were his statement of consumer demand theory in microeconomics, and the IS/LM model (1937), which summarised a Keynesian view of macroeconomics.  His book Value and Capital (1939) significantly extended general-equilibrium and value theory.  The compensated demand function is named the Hicksian demand function in memory of him.\n\nIn 1972 he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (jointly)  for his pioneering contributions to general equilibrium theory and welfare theory. \n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nHicks was born in 1904 at Warwick, England. His father was a journalist at a local newspaper.\n\nHe was educated at Clifton College (1917–22) and at Balliol College, Oxford (1922–26), financed by mathematical scholarships. During his school days, and in his first year at Oxford, he specialised in mathematics  but also had interests in literature and history. In 1923, he moved to Philosophy, Politics and Economics, the \"new school\" just being started at Oxford, graduating with second-class honors and, so he states, \"no adequate qualification in any of the subjects\" that he had studied. \n\nCareer, influences, and honours\n\nFrom 1926 to 1935 Hicks lectured at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He started  as a labour economist and did descriptive work on industrial relations but gradually he moved over to the analytical side, where his mathematics background returned to the fore. Hick's influences included Lionel Robbins and such associates as Friedrich von Hayek, R.G.D. Allen, Nicholas Kaldor, and Abba Lerner – and Ursula Webb, who, in 1935, became his wife.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938, he lectured at Cambridge where he was also a fellow of Gonville & Caius College. He was mainly occupied in writing Value and Capital, which was based on the work he had done in London. From 1938 to 1946, he was Professor at the University of Manchester. It was there that he did his main work on welfare economics, with its application to social accounting.\n\nIn 1946 he returned to Oxford, first as a research fellow of Nuffield College (1946–52), then as Drummond Professor of Political Economy (1952–65), and finally as a research fellow of All Souls College (1965–71) where he continued writing after retirement. He was also an honorary fellow of Linacre College.  He died in 1989.\n\nHicks was knighted in 1964 and was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (with Kenneth J. Arrow) in 1972. He donated the Nobel Prize to the London School of Economics and Political Science's Library Appeal in 1973.\n\nContributions to economic analysis\n\nHicks's early work as a labour economist culminated in The Theory of Wages (1932, 2nd ed. 1963), still considered standard in the field.  He collaborated with R.G.D. Allen in two seminal papers on value theory published in 1934.\n\nHis magnum opus is Value and Capital published in 1939.  The book built on ordinal utility  and mainstreamed the now-standard distinction between the substitution effect and the income effect for an individual in demand theory for the 2-good case. It generalised the analysis to the case of one good and a composite good, that is, all other goods. It aggregated individuals and businesses through demand and supply across the economy. It anticipated the aggregation problem, most acutely for the stock of capital goods. It introduced general equilibrium theory to an English-speaking audience, refined the theory for dynamic analysis, and for the first time attempted a rigorous statement of stability conditions for general equilibrium.  In the course of analysis Hicks formalised comparative statics.  In the same year, he also developed the famous \"compensation\" criterion called Kaldor–Hicks efficiency for welfare comparisons of alternative public policies or economic states.\n\nHicks's most familiar contribution in macroeconomics was the Hicks–Hansen IS–LM model,  which formalised an interpretation of the theory of John Maynard Keynes (see Keynesianism). The model describes the economy as a balance between three commodities: money, consumption and investment. Hicks himself did not embrace the theory as he interpreted it; and, in a paper published in 1980, Hicks asserted that it had omitted some crucial components of Keynes's arguments, especially those related to uncertainty.\nQuestion:\nIn 1972 John Hicks became the first Briton to win which of the Nobel Prizes?\nAnswer:\nResponse probability\nPassage:\nAstraphobia\nAstraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, or nicaduranaphobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia derives from the Greek words ἀστραπή (astrape; lightning) and φόβος (phobos; fear). \n\nSymptoms\n\nA person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, the sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, the feeling of dread, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm.  They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows.\n\nA sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. An astraphobic person will be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. In very extreme cases, astraphobia can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home.\n\nChildren\n\nA 2007 study found astraphobia the third most prevalent phobia in the US.  It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child's phobia should be addressed, for it may become a serious problem in adulthood.\n\nTo lessen a child's fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment; a fearless adult is an excellent role model for children. Sometimes children cannot be attracted to video games and activities while a thunderstorm is happening. Some children usually go to basements and other places that are quiet or places that have no windows.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also often used to treat astraphobia.  The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to himself or herself in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort.\n\nDogs and cats\n\nDogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol - a hormone associated with stress - affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and Dog Appeasing Pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers. \n\nStudies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is very rare, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm. \n\nGenerally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals. Showing fearlessness is, arguably, the best method to \"cure\" the anxiety.\nQuestion:\nTonitrophobia is the fear of which weather condition?\nAnswer:\nThundering\nPassage:\nReginald Doherty\nReginald \"Reggie\" or \"R.F.\" Frank Doherty (14 October 1872 – 29 December 1910) was a British tennis player.\n\nDoherty was a World No. 1 ranked player, and the older brother of British tennis player Laurence Doherty. He was known in the tennis world as \"R.F.\" rather than \"Reggie\".[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res\nF50F14F7385417738DDDA90B94DA415B808DF1D3  \"Famous Tennis Player Dead: R.F. Doherty, Once American Champion, Passes Away in London\"], The New York Times, 30 December 1910\n\nEarly life\n\nDoherty was born on 14 October 1872 at Beulah Villa in Wimbledon, Surrey, the oldest son of William Doherty, a printer, and his wife, Catherine Ann Davis. Doherty began tennis early in life and as a boy at Westminster School showed great promise. At age 14 he won the boys' singles title at an open championship in Llandudno. Doherty was educated at the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall), where he played for the Cambridge University Lawn Tennis Club.  In 1895 and 1895 he was part of the Cambridge team that beat Oxford and won the Scottish and Essex championships.\n\nCareer\n\nGrand Slams\n\nDoherty played in his first Wimbledon Championships in 1894 and lost in the first round to Clement Cazalet in four sets. In 1897 Doherty won his first singles Wimbledon title after beating reigning champion Harold Mahony in three straight sets (6–4, 6–4, 6–3). He successfully defended his title for the next three years (1898, 1899, 1900). In 1898 he did so by beating his brother in the Challenge Round in five sets (6–3, 6–3, 2–6, 5–7, 6–1). In 1901 he finally lost his Wimbledon crown when he was defeated in the Challenge Round by Arthur Gore in four sets (6–4, 5–7, 4–6, 4–6). He was also a runner-up at the US Championships in 1902 where he was beaten by the defending American champion William Larned in four sets (6–4, 2–6, 4–6, 6–8). Together with his brother Laurie he won eight Wimbledon Championships doubles titles and two US Championship doubles titles.\n\nDavis Cup\n\nDoherty represented the British Isles in the prestigious Davis Cup contest from 1902 to 1906. In 1902 he won the doubles match with his brother but lost the final and decisive singles match against American Malcolm Whitman in straight sets (1–6, 5–7, 4–6). In 1903 he contributed significantly to his team's first Davis Cup title against the United States by winning the doubles match and the decisive singles match against Robert Wrenn. Doherty won the Davis Cup trophy a further three times (1904, 1905, 1906) although in these years he only competed, and won, in the doubles matches. \n\nOlympics\n\nDoherty won the doubles title (gold medals were not given at the 1900 Games) at the 1900 Olympic Games in Paris with his brother.  He also competed in the singles tournament and reached the semifinal, where he was scheduled to play against his brother. Reggie withdrew, since the brothers refused to play each other before the final.  He also won the mixed doubles title with five-time Wimbledon champion Charlotte Cooper. Doherty did not compete in the 1904 Olympics in St. Louis. In the 1908 Olympics in London Reggie again won the doubles title, this time with compatriot George Hillyard. \n\nR.F. Doherty was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1980 together with his brother. \n\nDeath\n\nDoherty died of heart failure and neurasthenia on 29 December 1910 at the age of only 38 at his home in Kensington a day after returning from a convalescence stay in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland. \n\nAccording to his obituary in The New York Times, Doherty had \"been ill health for some time\". The article further stated, he \"held at various times every important championship the world of tennis has for a man to win. He was not beaten until he began to fail in health\". Both brothers apparently suffered from respiratory problems throughout their lives. \n\nR.F. and his brother had been urged to take up lawn tennis by their father, reportedly for health reasons.\n\nGrand Slam finals \n\nSingles: 6 (4 titles, 2 runners-up)\n\nDoubles: 13 (10 titles, 3 runners-up)\nQuestion:\nReginald Doherty, Arthur Gore and Fred Perry are associated with which sport?\nAnswer:\nLawn tennis\nPassage:\nHappy Hour (The Housemartins song)\n\"Happy Hour\" is a 1986 single by British Indie rock band The Housemartins.  It was the third single from the album London 0 Hull 4 and reached number three in the UK Singles Chart.   It was written on Wednesday 22 January 1986 - the same day Me and the Farmer was penned.  \n\nThe band's first big hit, it stayed on the singles chart for 13 weeks, peaking in the week of 28 June 1986.   The song also enjoyed exposure on United States college radio.  \n\nRolling Stone noted that despite \"irrepressibly giddy music hooks\", the song's \"sobering\" lyrics \"hammer away at the hypocrisy and sexism of young British business types on the move.\"  \n\nOn their 1992 album, Gordon, the Barenaked Ladies paid tribute to this song by breaking into it at the end of the song \"Hello City\". \n\nComedian Phill Jupitus makes an appearance in the music video, reading a newspaper.\n\nCharts\nQuestion:\nWhich Hull group had a Top Five single in 1986 with 'Happy Hour’?\nAnswer:\nHousemartins\nPassage:\nScientific law\nA scientific law is a statement based on repeated experimental observations that describes some aspects of the universe. A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. Factual and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the philosophy of science, going back to David Hume, is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to constant conjunction. \n\nLaws differ from scientific theories in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. Ohm's law only applies to linear networks, Newton's law of universal gravitation only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of aerodynamics such as Bernoulli's principle do not apply in case of compressible flow such as occurs in transonic and supersonic flight, Hooke's law only applies to strain below the elastic limit, etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take mathematical forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the Law of Conservation of Energy can be written as \\Delta E 0, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the First Law of Thermodynamics can be written as \\mathrm{d}U\n\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,.\n\nThe term \"scientific law\" is traditionally associated with the natural sciences, though the social sciences also contain laws.Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg (1993), \"[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]\", Nature, 365:6445 (30), page 385. An example of a scientific law in social sciences is Zipf's law.\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be falsified if they are found in contradiction with new data.\nQuestion:\nWhich scientific law can be expressed in the form V = IR*?

But the past few years, I've read several articles that refer to a \"new\" taste called \"umami.\" In the articles I've read, it's never very clearly described, and I'm not even sure if researchers agree that it counts as a separate taste category. Any chance you could give us the straight dope on this flavor?\n— Janet Zimmerman, San Francisco, CA\nAh, taste . . . right up there with sight, as far as I'm concerned. Whether it's Fruit Loops or General Tso's Chicken, I'm happy to tackle any questions about food. After all, all the taste I've got is in my mouth, or so I've been told.\nIn any case, yes, indeed, there is a fifth taste known as \"umami\" (that's \"oo-MOM-mee,\" and I shudder to think of when the term might be uttered when the speaker is not referring to taste). This is the term that's been given to the taste associated with monosodium glutamate, or MSG.\nMonosodium glutamate is the salt form of glutamic acid, a non-essential amino acid. It's found naturally in many if not most edibles. The flavor, though, is apparently substantially different than just plain salt, and has been described as \"meaty.\" The taste bud receptor for this taste was discovered in 1996, although the Japanese have supposedly been aware of it as a separate taste since around the turn of the century.\nWhile MSG occurs naturally in all kinds of foods, it is also added to many others. Most processed foods have some MSG added, since it's been known as a \"flavor-enhancer\" for decades. There are several methods for adding MSG to processed foods: sometimes it's added directly; sometimes it's added by processing other substances in a way which concentrates the MSG (hydrolyzed vegetable protein and autolyzed yeast extract are examples). In any case, if you eat any processed foods at all, chances are you're getting more MSG than you'd be getting if everything you ate came out of your own garden.\nThis is not seen as a good thing by many. On November 4th, 1991, CBS ran a \"60 Minutes\" segment on people who are supposedly \"sensitive\" to MSG. These people blame MSG sensitivity for everything from slight headaches to migraines to nausea and diarrhea to death. The number of people who are sensitive varies greatly, depending on who you listen to: in the \"60 Minutes\" story, Michael Taylor, Deputy of Policy for the FDA, stated that possibly 2% of the U.S. population is MSG reactive, about 5,000,000; a chart called \"Major Causes of Restaurant Syndrome\" in the Jan-Feb 1987 NER Allergy Proc. Book, Vol 8, No 1, estimates that 15 to 20% of our population is sensitive, about 50,000,000; Dr. George Schwartz, M.D., author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Symptom Complex, believes the numbers are much higher, perhaps 40% to 50%.\nNaturally, the processed food industry scoffs, citing the fact that MSG occurs naturally, even in the human body. On the other hand, \"natural\" substances cause various allergies and sensitivities in millions of people daily, so it seems plausible to me that increased amounts of a \"naturally-occurring substance\" could, indeed, set off someone's internal red alert. Fortunately for me, I don't suffer any of the symptoms normally associated with MSG sensitivity, so my Doritos are safe. For more information on MSG senstivities put out by the people who supposedly suffer from them, see www.nomsg.com (this is most definitely an anti-MSG website, so please take everything you read with a grain of sodium, mono-glutamated or not; I don't offer this site as the definitive word on MSG sensitivities, simply as a place to read one side of the argument).\nSo, Janet, the next time you have some of General Tso's Chicken and think to yourself, \"mmmm, meaty,\" take pride in knowing that your umami-receptors are functioning admirably. And make sure you've got your Excedrin with you, just in case.\n— Veg\nStaff Reports are written by the Straight Dope Science Advisory Board, Cecil's online auxiliary.

It stars Robin Williams, Daryl Sabara, and Alexie Gilmore. The film was released on July 24, 2009 on video on demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21, 2009.\n\nPlot\n\nLance Clayton (Williams) is a single father and high school English teacher. He dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son, Kyle (Sabara), is a pornography-obsessed underachiever who despises everyone, especially his father.  Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his alcoholic mother. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal (Geoff Pierson), who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire (Gilmore), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike (Henry Simmons), whose writing class is more successful than Lance's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie (Mitzi McCall).\n\nOne night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom. To avoid embarrassing his son, he stages Kyle’s death as a suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle’s computer and hangs his son’s body in the closet. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.\n\nEnjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a post-mortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew finds Kyle’s suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle’s honor. \n\nAt the library dedication, Lance finds that he can no longer live with his lie and confesses before the school. Lance is denounced by the students and faculty, including Claire. Lance nevertheless feels reborn, and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Andrew tells Lance he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed Lance's writing. The two of them happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.\n\nCast\n\n* Robin Williams as Lance Clayton\n* Alexie Gilmore as Claire Reed\n* Daryl Sabara as Kyle Clayton\n* Evan Martin as Andrew\n* Geoff Pierson as Principal Wyatt Anderson\n* Henry Simmons as Mike Lane\n* Mitzi McCall as Bonnie\n* Jermaine Williams as Jason\n* Lorraine Nicholson as Heather\n* Morgan Murphy as Morgan\n* Toby Huss as Bert Green\n* Tom Kenny as Jerry Klein (talk show producer)\n* Jill Talley as Make-Up Woman\n* Bruce Hornsby as himself\n* Krist Novoselic as Newspaper Vendor (cameo)\n* Bobcat Goldthwait as the limo driver (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot in Seattle, Washington, largely at the former F.A. McDonald School in Wallingford.  Seattle resident and former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic has a wordless cameo while consoling Williams' character at a newspaper stand (Goldthwait had previously opened for Nirvana). Bruce Hornsby appears as himself at the library dedication.\n\nHome video\n\nThe DVD was released on December 8, 2009 and featured an audio commentary track with the director, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a making of featurette.\n\nReception\n\nWorld's Greatest Dad received critical acclaim, holding an 89% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10, with the critical consensus: \"World's Greatest Dad is a risky, deadpan, dark comedy that effectively explores the nature of posthumous cults of celebrity.\"  The film also holds a score of 69 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" \n\nThe film was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, the website hailing it as a \"lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy.\" It also commented on Robin Williams' performance as outstanding. Sandra L. Frey observed the film's portrayal of teen angst, and said that the film also reminds the audience that adults can offer strong angst of their own.  Devin Faraci called the film \"brilliant\" and \"genius.\" Paul Fischer named it as one of the best films of the year.  Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz both gave the film favorable reviews on At The Movies. Mankiewicz saluted Daryl Sabara's performance as exceptionally well done, commented on the film's \"remarkably funny script,\" and overall considered it a \"little gem.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave World's Greatest Dad 3 out of 4 stars, but noticed that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director's intention.\nQuestion:\nWhich actor said, in the film ‘World’s Greatest Dad’, ‘I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone.   It’s not.  The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone’?\nAnswer:\nRobin Willaims\nPassage:\nCarat (mass)\nThe carat (ct) is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg (0.2 g; 0.007055 oz) and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls.\nThe current definition, sometimes known as the metric carat, was adopted in 1907 at the Fourth General Conference on Weights and Measures,  and soon afterwards in many countries around the world.  The carat is divisible into one hundred points of two milligrams each. Other subdivisions, and slightly different mass values, have been used in the past in different locations.\n\nIn terms of diamonds, a paragon is a flawless stone of at least 100 carats (20 g).\n\nThe ANSI X.12 EDI standard abbreviation for the carat is CD. \n\nEtymology\n\nFirst attested in English in the mid-15th century, the word carat came from Italian carato, which came from Greek kerátion (κεράτιον) meaning carob seed (literally \"small horn\") and potentially from  Arabic qīrāṭ (قيراط).  \n(diminutive of - keras, \"horn\" )\nand was a unit of weight \nthough it was not likely used to measure gold in classical times.\nThe Latin word for carat is siliqua.\nThis common belief that carat derives from carob seeds stems from the assumption that the seeds had unusually low variability in mass.\n\nHowever, one group of researchers has found that carob seeds in fact have typical variability compared to the seeds of other species. \n\nThis was not the only reason. It is said that, to keep regional buyers and sellers of gold honest, potential customers could retrieve their own carob seeds on their way to the market, to check the tolerances of the seeds used by the merchant. If this precaution was not taken, the potential customers would be at the mercy of \"2 sets of carob seeds\". One set of \"heavier\" carob seeds would be used when buying from a customer (making the seller's gold appear to be less). Another, lighter set of carob seeds would be used when the merchant wanted to sell to a customer.\n\nIn the past, each country had its own carat. It was often used for weighing gold. Starting in the 1570s, it was used to measure weights of diamonds.\n\nHistorical definitions\n\nUK Board of Trade \n\nIn the United Kingdom the original Board of Trade carat was exactly  grains (~3.170 gr);  in 1888, the Board of Trade carat was changed to exactly  grains (~3.168 gr).  Despite its being a non-metric unit, a number of metric countries have used this unit for its limited range of application.\n\nThe Board of Trade carat was divisible into four diamond grains,  but measurements were typically made in multiples of  carat.\n\nRefiners' carats \n\nThere were also two varieties of refiners' carats once used in the United Kingdom — the pound carat and the ounce carat.  The pound troy was divisible into 24 pound carats of 240 grains troy each; the pound carat was divisible into four p
